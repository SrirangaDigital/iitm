<h1>Lilavati's Daughters</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This initiative of the Women in Science (WiS) Panel relates to mentoring of young women who are potentially looking for careers in science, engineering, medicine etc.</p>
<p>WiS has compiled a collection of essays on the lives of Indian women scientists in the form a book titled 'Lilavati's Daughters: The Women Scientists of India'. The book contains brief biographical and autobiographical sketches of about one hundred women scientists from India. Covering a range of disciplines, in these essays the women scientists talk of what brought them to science, what kept their interest alive, and what has helped them achieve some measure of distinction in their careers.</p>
<p>The Panel of Women in Science hopes that this collection would represent our cultural diversity as well as cover a large range of disciplines so that any woman student could gain from the insights and experiences of women to whom they can relate at many levels.</p>
<p>The book 'Lilavati's Daughters: The Women Scientists of India' was successfully released during the Inaugural session of the Annual meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences on 31st October, 2008, by Dr. D. Balasubramanian, President of IAS, at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi. Check the book here:</p>
