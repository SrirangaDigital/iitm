<p>The issue of under representation of women in science is being seen with a great deal of concern all over the world. Over the years, several Academy Fellows had suggested a need to address this concern. In order to, examine and study the current status with regard to women in science in the Indian context; the factors influencing the science career for Indian women; and to suggest recommendations, the Council of the Indian Academy of Sciences had in January 2003 constituted a committee on "Women in Science". This committee had come up with many initiatives and action plan for consideration by the Council and Fellowship. This led  to the formation of the Panel of Women in Science to carry out the recommendations made by the committee.</p>
<p>The Indian National Science Academy (INSA) had also set up a committee so that INSA and IASc could work together and come up with joint set of recommendations and action points). A report "Science career for Indian Women – An examination of Indian women's access to and retention in scientific careers" has been brought out by INSA.</p>
