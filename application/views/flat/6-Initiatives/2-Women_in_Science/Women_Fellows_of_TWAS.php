Her glyco-immunological work has established O-acetylated sialioglycoproteins as novel decisive biomarkers in leukaemia. Her earlier work on visceral leishmaniasis has provided scope for advanced diagnostic, therapeutic and clinical status monitoring and led to three transfers of technology. Fellow of all science academies of India, and a JC Bose Fellow, she delivered the Yellapragada Subba Rao Lecture of INSA in 2011. Elected as Fellow.</div>
