<h1>Information for Authors</h1>
<h2>Proceedings â€“ Mathematical Sciences</h2>

<p>This journal is a quarterly research journal which publishes refereed papers covering current research in Mathematics. The papers normally present results of original work. Critical reviews of important fields are also published. Papers in applied areas are considered for publication only on the basis of their mathematical content. Special issue devoted to advances in specific areas of mathematics and proceedings of selected high quality conferences are also published.</p>
<p>The submission of a paper will be held to imply that it represents the results of their original research not previously published; that it is not under consideration for publication, elsewhere; and that if accepted for the Proceedings, it will not be submitted elsewhere.</p>
<p>The decision of the Editor/Editorial Board on the suitability of a paper for publication will be FINAL.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction for all disputes concerning submitted articles, published material, subscription and sale will be at courts/tribunals situated in Bengaluru City only.</p>

<h3>Manuscript Submission</h3>
<p>Authors are required to submit manuscripts online to <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmsc" target="_blank">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmsc</a></p>
<p>Editorial Manager is a user-friendly online submission and review management system. Authors can submit manuscripts and track the processing of their paper. Authors are requested to suggest a Communicating Editor from the list provided, to be assigned to their paper. The decision will be taken by the Chief Editor. For areas not listed, please choose the Chief Editor. Electronic files in LATEX are preferred. However, MS-WORD files are also acceptable. Authors who have insurmountable difficulties that preclude web submission should contact mathsci@ias.ernet.in</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>The title of the paper should be brief and contain words useful for indexing. Full names and affiliations of all authors, and complete postal and email addresses should be provided. <strong>Please note: Names of authors should be listed in alphabetical order of the last names of authors.</strong> The editorial office of the journal will change it to this style if names are not given in alphabetical order. An abbreviated running title of not more than 50 characters (including spaces) is required.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Each paper must include an abstract describing, in not more than 200 words, the significant results reported in the paper. Abbreviations are discouraged. Abstracts should not include citations to references.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>Between 3 and 6 keywords must be provided for indexing and information retrieval services.</p>

<h3>Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)</h3>
<p>Authors must provide <a href="<?=RESOURCES_URL?>Journals/Information_for_Authors/msc2010.pdf" target="_blank">2010 Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) numbers</a> representing the primary and secondary subjects of the work.</p>

<h3>Main Text</h3>
<p>This should be divided into sections and should preferably begin with an introduction where the results are placed in perspective and some indication of the methods of proof is given. Manuscript should be prepared in single column. Use British English as the preferred language.</p>

<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>Equations should be clearly presented, each on its own line, well away from the text. Display equations must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals with the equation number in parentheses in the right-hand margin. The position of the superscripts and subscripts (exponents and indices) should be clear, for example b<sub>j</sub>, a<sup>i</sup>, etc.</p>
<p>Formulae extending beyond the printed line will be broken by the typesetter at an appropriate place.</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>All tables must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals in the order of appearance in the text. The tables should be self-contained as possible, with a descriptive but brief title. Tables should be arranged as far as possible to conform to printed column or page size.</p>

<h3>Figures</h3>
<p>A figure should be included only when it is substantially helpful to the reader in understanding the subject matter. The figures should be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals in the order of appearance in the text and the location of each figure should be clearly indicated as "Figure 1 here".</p>
<p>All lettering in illustrations should be in sans-serif type, and as close to 8 point size as possible at final print size; hairlines should not be used, minimum line thickness should be 0.2 mm or 0.5 point.</p>

<h3>Appendices</h3>
<p>All appendices should be numbered consecutively using the English alphabets, e.g. Appendix A, Appendix B, etc. Display equations appearing within the Appendices should also be numbered consecutively, i.e. for Appendix A as (A1), (A2),... and for Appendix B as (B1), (B2),....</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>References should be cited in the text by serial numbers only (e.g. [3]). They should be listed alphabetically by the author's name (the first author's name in the case of joint authorship) at the end of the paper. In describing each reference the following order should be observed: the author's name followed by initials, title of the article, the name of the journal, the volume number, the year and the page numbers. Standard abbreviations of journal titles should be used. It would be worthwhile to cross-check all references cited in the text with the ones given in the list at the end.</p>
<p>A typical reference to an article in a journal would be like:</p>
<p>[1] Narasimhan M S and Ramanan S, Moduli of vector bundles on a compact Riemann surface, <em>Ann. Math.</em> <strong>89</strong> (1969) 14-51</p>
<p>A reference to a book would be on the following lines:</p>
<p>[2] Royden H, Invariant metrics on Teichmuller space, in: Contributions to analysis (eds) L Ahlors <em>et al</em> (1974) (New York: Academic Press) pp. 393-399</p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>This should follow immediately after the end of the main text. In references to granting agencies, the names should be written out fully. Funding agencies and technical assistance only need to be acknowledged.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p>Footnotes to the text should be avoided. If unavoidable, they should be numbered consecutively and typed on a separate sheet.</p>

<h3>Proofs</h3>
<p>Authors are requested to prepare the manuscript carefully and in accordance with these instructions to avoid delays and to minimize corrections and alterations. The corresponding author will receive page proofs, typically as a PDF file. Corrections should be emailed within two or three days. No further proofs will be sent.</p>
