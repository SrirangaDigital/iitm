<h1>Journal of Earth System Science</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Journal of Earth System Science was earlier a part of  the Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences – Section A begun in 1934,  and later split in 1978 into theme journals. This journal was published as Proceedings – Earth and Planetary Sciences since 1978, and in 2005 was renamed ‘Journal of Earth System Science’.</p>
<h3>Aim and Scope</h3>
<p>The journal is highly inter-disciplinary and publishes scholarly research – new data, ideas, and conceptual advances – in Earth System Science. The focus is on the evolution of the Earth as a system: manuscripts describing changes of anthropogenic origin in a limited region are not considered unless they go beyond describing the changes to include an analysis of earth-system processes. The journal's scope includes the solid earth (geosphere), the atmosphere, the hydrosphere (including cryosphere), and the biosphere; it also addresses related aspects of planetary and space sciences. Contributions pertaining to the Indian sub- continent and the surrounding Indian-Ocean region are particularly welcome. Given that a large number of manuscripts report either observations or model results for a limited domain, manuscripts intended for publication in JESS are expected to fulfill at least one of the following three criteria.</p>
<ol>
	<li>The data should be of relevance and should be of statistically significant size and from a region from where such data are sparse. If the data are from a well-sampled region, the data size should be considerable and advance our knowledge of the region.</li>
	<li>A model study is carried out to explain observations reported either in the same manuscript or in the literature.</li>
	<li>The analysis, whether of data or with models, is novel and the inferences advance the current knowledge.</li>
</ol>
