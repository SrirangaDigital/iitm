<h1>Information for Authors</h1>
<h2>Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy</h2>

<p>The Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy publishes papers on all aspects of Astrophysics and Astronomy, including instrumentation. The submission of a paper will be held to imply that it represents the results of original research not previously published; that it is not under consideration for publication, elsewhere; and that if accepted for the journal, it will not be submitted elsewhere.</p>
<p>The decision of the Chief Editor/Editorial Board on the suitability of a paper for publication will be final.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction for all disputes concerning submitted articles, published material, subscription and sale will be at courts/tribunals situated in Bengaluru City only.</p>

<h3>Manuscript Submission</h3>
<p>Authors are required to submit manuscripts online to <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/joaa">http://www.editorialmanager.com/joaa</a></p>
<p>Editorial Manager is a user-friendly online submission and review management system. Authors can submit manuscripts and track the processing of their papers. Electronic files in LATEX are preferred. However, MS-WORD files are also acceptable.</p>
<p class="text-blue">From January 2016, the Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy will move from the current publishing mode to Continuous Article Publishing (CAP) mode. This means that the each accepted article will be published immediately online with DOI and article citation ID with starting page number 1. Article will also be visible in Web of Science immediately. All these will help shorten the publication time and improve visibility of the articles.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>Authors should submit written permission from appropriate sources when material that has been published elsewhere is to be included in a paper.</p>

<h3>Title Page</h3>
<p>The title of the paper should be brief and contain words useful for indexing. Full names and affiliations of all authors, and complete postal and email addresses should be provided. An abbreviated running title of not more than 50 characters (including spaces) is required.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Each paper must include an abstract describing, in not more than 200 words, the significant results reported in the paper. Abbreviations are discouraged. Abstracts should not include citations to references.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>Between 3 and 6 keywords must be provided for indexing and information retrieval services.</p>

<h3>Main Text</h3>
<p>This should be divided into sections and should preferably begin with an introduction where the results are placed in perspective and some indication of the methods of proof is given. Manuscript should be prepared in single column. Use British English as the preferred language.</p>

<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>Equations must be clearly written, each on its own line, well away from the text. All equations must be numbered consecutively in arabic numerals with the equation number in parentheses on the right hand margin; number displayed equations consecutively within the article, not within the section.  Use italic for variables, bold for vectors and matrices, script for transforms, and sans serif for tensors.  Use superscripts and subscripts in superior or inferior position; do not use raised and lowered fonts.  Extend fraction bars under the entire length of the numerator.  Use the "degree" symbol instead of superscript lowercase "o."  Use "exp" rather than "e" if the argument of an exponential is complicated or lengthy.  Avoid awkward fractional composition by using negative powers.  Use solidus fractions (l/r) in text.  Use the following to avoid ambiguity: parentheses, brackets, and braces, in that order { [ ( ) ] }.  Add one extra line space above and below all displayed equations.</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p> All tables must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals in the order of appearance in the text. The tables should be self-contained as possible, with a descriptive but brief title. Tables should be arranged as far as possible to conform to printed column or page size. All columns must have headings arranged to clarify their relation to the data.  Footnotes should be indicated by superscript, lowercase letters.  Each table must be cited in text. Avoid tables created with the tab key, pictures, and embedded objects.</p>

<h3>Figures</h3>
<p>All figures including photographs should be numbered consecutively in arabic numerals in the order of appearance in the text. The figure captions must be typed on a separate sheet. Do not include in the figure any information that could easily be included in the caption.</p>
<p>The journal publishes colour figures free of cost if the reviewers and the editors are convinced that colour is essential for a figure.</p>
<p>For most graphics with lines and text only, use vector graphics EPS (Encapsulated PostScript).  EPS is preferred because it is scalable and one can zoom in without seeing large pixels in most cases. Most vector-based illustration software allows you to save an illustration as an EPS file.</p>
<p>For images or photographs, use TIFF or high-resolution JPEG.  JPEG is the best format for photos with a large file size because of the automatic compression used, which dramatically reduces file size while still providing good detail.</p>
<p>Use Helvetica as the font for legends and labels.  Ensure that no label or legend is smaller than 8 pt.  All lines must be at least 0.5 pt (no hairline rules).</p>

<h3>Appendices</h3>
<p>All appendices should be numbered consecutively using the English alphabets, e.g. Appendix A, Appendix B, etc. Display equations appearing within the Appendices should also be numbered consecutively, i.e. for Appendix A as (A1), (A2),... and for Appendix B as (B1), (B2),...</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p> References should follow the format prescribed by the International Astronomical Union, which is set out in I.A.U. Trans. XIIC and also described in the 'Guidelines for Authors'.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>This should follow immediately after the end of the main text. In references to granting agencies, the names should be written out fully. Funding agencies and technical assistance only need to be acknowledged.</p>

<h3>Proofs</h3>
<p>Authors are requested to prepare the manuscript carefully and in accordance with these instructions to avoid delays and to minimize corrections and alterations. The corresponding author will receive page proofs, typically as a PDF file. Corrections should be emailed within two or three days. No further proofs will be sent.</p>
