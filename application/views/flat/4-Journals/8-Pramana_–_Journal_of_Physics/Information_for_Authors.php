<h1>Information for Authors</h1>
<h2>Pramana â€“ Journal of Physics</h2>

<p>Authors are required to submit manuscripts online at <a target="_blank" href="http://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8080/epramana/jsp/epramana.html">e-Pramana.</a></p>
<p><strong>What is expected of a paper for consideration for publication in Pramana.</strong></p>
<p>Manuscripts should be based on the work that is</p>
<ol>
	<li>scientifically sound,</li>
	<li>original and important to the field, and</li>
	<li>presented in a satisfactory form.</li>
</ol>
<h3>I. Content</h3>
<p>Papers based on mathematical and computational work without a clear relationship to physics are generally not suitable for Pramana. It is authors' responsibility to bring out this lucidly in their presentation. Experimental work should represent novel finding connection. Papers reporting only measurements and characterization may not be adequate for publication in Pramana. Data should be presented along with analysis and interpretation to bring out the physics of the system studied.</p>
<p>If the paper is based on the work published in an abbreviated form earlier, it should present considerably more information and lead to a substantially improved understanding of the subject. It should</p>
<ul>
	<li>clearly state the goals of their paper in Pramana, and</li>
	<li>cite the published paper, particularly when some material is being reproduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>The work presented should not be a mere repetition of the research published earlier on a similar physical system or Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>If the model or the method used in analysis of the model used in your work is not new, you are expected to make clear connection between your results and real physical systems.</p>
<p>Authors are also expected to give a paragraph explaining this while submitting the manuscript.</p>
<p>A Corresponding Editor can reject a manuscript without review if found unsuitable.</p>
<h3>II. Form of the presentation</h3>
<p>Authors should give a paragraph in the covering letter describing</p>
<ol>
	<li>what is the back-ground or previous work, and what is the question tackled in the submitted manuscript,</li>
	<li>what is the main finding in the present manuscript, and</li>
	<li>which physical problems or theories are related to the work, and may be impacted by the present work.</li>
</ol>
<p>This paragraph should convince the editors that the paper should be peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>(This is only for regular submission, and not for conference proceedings/Theme issues).</p>
<p>The paper should be written in grammatically correct English and presented in the format of a Pramana template. Papers with trivial errors in the language and/or non-standard format will not be sent out for review.</p>
<p><a href="<?=RESOURCES_URL?>Journals/Information_for_Authors/pram/pram-style-2010.zip">pstyle1.zip</a> for Windows users</p>
<p><a href="<?=RESOURCES_URL?>Journals/Information_for_Authors/pram/pram-style-2010.zip">prastyleu.zip</a> for Unix users</p>
<p>New terminology should be introduced only when it is essential. Any abbreviations or new terms should be defined clearly before their use.</p>
<p>Abstract should summarize the work in a language accessible to non-specialist readers and bring out the current importance and relevance of the work to the field. Authors are encouraged to suggest at least three referees alongwith their home institute address and email address.</p>
<h3>III. Ethics</h3>
<p>Author should certify that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The paper represents original work with contributions from all the listed authors. Anyone who made nontrivial contributions was given an opportunity of co-authorship.</li>
	<li>All of the listed authors are aware of and agree to the submission of this manuscript.</li>
	<li>The manuscript has not been published, and is not now and will not be under consideration by another journal while it is considered here.</li>
	<li>The manuscript has not been published, and is not now and will not be under consideration by another journal while it is considered here.</li>
	<li>They have provided information about any relevant unpublished manuscripts.</li>
	<li>The authors accept the established procedures for selecting manuscripts for publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>Upon submission of a manuscript for publication, the author, or in the case of multiple authors the corresponding author, is required to complete, sign and send to the editorial office of the journal by e-mail the following</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="Research_papers">Research papers</h3>
<p>Normal full length papers which describe significant and substantial original work. These should not normally exceed 12 printed pages.</p>

<h3 id="Rapid_Communications">Rapid communications</h3>
<p>These will be processed faster by the journal. A need for urgent publication, as judged by our referees and editors, will be an important additional criterion in the acceptance of such contributions. The paper should describe the work concisely, being not longer than six printed pages. A longer article, containing full details of the same work, can be separately considered under category (1) above (research papers).</p>

<h3 id="Comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Comments on papers which have already appeared in Pramana, or addenda and errata to such papers by the authors themselves. These could be as short as a paragraph, but not ordinarily longer than 1000 words or equivalent.</p>

<h3 id="Brief_reports">Brief reports</h3>
<p>These should be short articles (not more than six printed pages) making specific technical points of interest to others in the area, even though the content may not be substantial enough to be considered under category (1).</p>

<h3 id="Review_articles">Review articles</h3>
<p>In addition to the different categories of papers mentioned above, Pramana now publishes review articles. These are by invitation and represent a scholarly review of an area of physics, with substantial references to the existing literature in the field. The invitations are generally initiated by the Editorial Board. However, any author(s) with ideas for a potential review article are welcome to communicate to the Editors a synopsis and a detailed plan of the proposed review. This will be assessed and if found acceptable an invitation to contribute a review could result. All review articles are still refereed after their submittal. Pramana also intends to publish topical reviews which are not necessarily comprehensive but represent a particularly interesting or important viewpoint (even if it is not universally accepted) since such articles can stimulate further work. Authors wishing to have papers published in Pramana in any of the above categories should send them to the Editorial Office.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Authors are encouraged to submit the manuscript electronically by accessing http://www.ias.ac.in/epramana or by e-mail to pramana@ias.ernet.in.</p>

<h3 id="Electronic_Submission">Electronic submission</h3>
<p>Electronic files in LaTeX are preferred. However, MS-WORD files are also acceptable. Figures should be supplied in eps (encapsulated postscript) or pdf formats.</p>

<h3 id="Type_Script">Typescript</h3>
<p>Papers must be written clearly and concisely in English, the preferred spelling being that of the Concise Oxford Dictionary. They must be typed double spaced with ample margin on all sides on white bond A4 size paper (297 x 210 mm). This also applies to the abstract, tables, figure captions and the list of references each of which are to be typed on separate sheets.</p>

<h3 id="Title_Page">Title page</h3>
<p>The first page must bear</p>
<ol>
	<li class="gap-above-small">title of the paper</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">the initials and the names of the authors</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">names and addresses of the institutions where the work was carried out</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">the permanent or present addresses of the authors (if different from c) and</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme Number for the manuscript.</li>
</ol>
<p>A copy of the scheme can be obtained from the Editorial Office. Authors should suggest an abbreviated running title of not more than 50 characters including spaces. The title must be specific and should contain words useful for indexing.</p>

<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>All papers must have an abstract of not more than 200 words. The abstract should indicate the general scope of the paper, the important findings and the conclusions drawn.</p>

<h3 id="Keywords">Keywords</h3>
<p>Between 3 and 6 keywords must be provided for indexing and information retrieval services.</p>

<h3 id="PACS_Numbers">PACS numbers</h3>
<p>Provide atleast three, and upto four , PACS numbers, with the first number being the most appropriate. e.g. (47.27.Vf).<br />
PACS is also available online (in both hierarchical and alphabetical formats) via
AIPs world wide web server. Use PACS 2006 version.<br />
http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs06/pacs06-toc.html<br />
ASCII and wordperfect files are available via anonymous http://www.aip.org/pacs/ in
the PACS subdirectory. Use PACS 2006 version.</p>

<h3 id="List_of_Symbols">List of symbols</h3>
<p>In cases where the number of symbols used is large, the authors should attach to the manuscript a separate complete list of symbols identified typographically, not mathematically. This list will not appear in print but is essential in order to avoid costly corrections at the proof stage. In other cases, a clear typographical identification of each symbol, made in the margin in quotes (e.g. "epsilon") the first time it appears in the text should be adequate.</p>

<h3 id="Text">Text</h3>
<p>The paper must be divided into sections starting preferably with 'Introduction' and ending with 'Conclusions'. The main sections should be numbered 1, 2, 3, etc and subsections 2.1, 2.2 etc.</p>

<h3 id="Tables">Tables</h3>
<p>All tables must be numbered consecutive!y in Arabic numerals (not Roman) (e.g. table 3) in the order of appearance in the text. The tables should be self-contained and have a descriptive title. Column headings of tables should be brief. Extensive tables will be reproduced photographically and should therefore be typed carefully and in the exact format desired. Footnotes to the tables, if any, should be identified by superscript symbols and placed at the bottom of the page containing the table.</p>

<h3 id="Footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p>Footnotes to the text should be avoided if possible. When necessary they should be numbered along with the references (numbers in square brackets) sequentially in the main text. The matter of each footnote should appear after the appropriate number in the list of references.</p>

<h3 id="Appendices">Appendices</h3>
<p>Appendices should be labeled as A, B, etc. and the equations appearing in them be labeled as A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.</p>

<h3 id="Proofs">Proofs</h3>
<p>Pdf file of the formatted proof will be sent to the corresponding authors for correction and return within two days. If the corrections are not received within a reasonable time it will be assumed that the authors have no corrections to make.</p>

<h3 id="References">References</h3>
<p>References should be numbered in order of appearance in the text of the paper, the number being enclosed in square brackets in the same line. E.g. "It has been shown [1, 2] that...'or' Ramachandran and Raman [14] developed a formalism in 1955 which made it possible...". The second example is meant to show that while names of authors and dates are not essential, they can be included even in this format. At the end of the manuscript, references to articles in journals should be listed by number, again in square brackets, followed by authors names (preceded by initials), abbreviated journal title, volume, first page number and year in brackets, e.g. [4] P W Anderson, <em>Phys. Rev</em>., <strong>109</strong>, 1492 (1958). References to books should include: name(s) of author(s) (preceded by initials), title of the book, edition if not the first, initials and name(s) of editor(s) if any, preceded by "edited by" and publisher, place of publication, year within brackets and chapter or pages referred to, e.g. [12] J de Boer and J Eichler, in <em>Advances in nuclear physics</em> edited by M Baranger and E Vogt (Plenum, New York, 1968) Vol. 1, p. 1. References to theses must include the title of the thesis, the degree for which submitted, the University and year.</p>

<h3 id="Mathematical_Materials">Mathematical Materials</h3>
<p>Equations must be clearly written, each on its own line, well away from the text. All equations must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals with the number in parentheses near the right hand margin. If desired, equations can be numbered consecutively in each section preceded by a point and the section number e.g. (3.14) for the 14th equation in section 3. Indices, subscripts, superscripts and exponents must be clearly indicated in pencil in one copy of the manuscript, 'Oh' and 'zero', K, k and Kappa, 'ell' and 'one', etc. must be clearly distinguished. Authors must indicate wherever special characters (greek, gothic, script, scalar, vector, tensor, matrix, etc.) are required. All other letters will be set in italic type. Vectors must be underlined by a wavy line and tensors and matrices by two wavy lines. The SI system of units and symbols is recommended.</p>

<p>The author's attention is specially drawn to the instructions on items below. If these are not followed strictly, both the quality of reproduction and the technical accuracy would be jeopardised. Therefore, in such cases the manuscripts may have to be returned to the authors for improvement causing delays in their publication.</p>

<h3 id="Figures">Figures</h3>
<p>All figures, including photographs (which must be glossy prints) should be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals in the order of occurrence in the text. Figure captions must be typed on a separate sheet. Line drawings must be in Indian ink on good quality tracing paper. Curves should be drawn sufficiently thick to permit reduction to one half or even one third of the original size. The axes and letterings must be about 0.3 mm thick and curves 0.6 mm thick. Whenever computer outputs are directly submitted as figures, they should conform to the same specifications given earlier for drawings.</p>
