<h1>Information for Authors</h1>
<h2>Resonance – Journal of Science Education</h2>

<p><em>Resonance – journal of Science Education</em> is targeted primarily at undergraduate students and teachers. The journal invites articles in various branches of science and emphasizes on a lucid style that will attract readers from diverse backgrounds. A helpful rule would be that at least the opening one-third of the article should be easily understood by a general readership.</p>
<p>Articles on topics within the undergraduate curriculum, especially those which students often consider difficult to understand, new classroom experiments, emerging techniques and ideas, and innovative procedures for teaching specific concepts are particularly welcome. The submitted articles should not have been published elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>Rsonance</em> also includes Book Reviews. The following types of books will be considered:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="gap-above-small">text-books in subjects of interest to the journal;</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">general books in science which should be brought to the attention of students/teachers;</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">classic literature on science;</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">books on educational methods.</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">Websites or CDs related to science education.</li>
</ol>
<p>Books reviewed should generally be affordable to students/teachers (price range Rs. 50 to 300). New books will get preference. Books received by the academy office will be circulated among the editors who will then decide which are to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Upon submission of a manuscript for publication, the author, or in the case of multiple authors the corresponding author, is required to complete, sign and send to the editorial office of the journal by email or post the Manuscript Submission Form (see form at the end).</p>

<h3>Author(s)</h3>
<p>A photograph and a brief biographical sketch (in less than 30 words) should be provided. The author's name and mailing address should also be given. Author's phone number and email address will help in expediting the processing of manuscripts.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Please provide a brief summary (2 &ndash; 4 sentences) of the article highlighting the important points.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>A few keywords must be provided for indexing and information retrieval services.</p>

<h3>Text</h3>
<p>Use simple English. Keep sentences short. Break up the text into logical units, with easily understandable headings and sub-headings. Do not use multiple sub-sections. <strong>Articles should generally consist of 1000 &ndash; 2000 words.</strong></p>

<h3>Illustrations</h3>

All figures, including photographs (which must be glossy prints) should be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals in the order of occurrence in the text. Please try to keep the size of the figures between 4 and 13 cm based on the importance of the figure. Figure captions must be written with care and in some detail. Illustrations and other material from already published sources must be properly credited: <strong>It is the author's responsibility to obtain permission for reproduction</strong> (copies of letters of permission should be sent). For details, see Author Guidelines for Figures.</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>Please place all tables, boxes, illustrations and their captions after the main text of the article with suggested locations marked in the text.</p>

<h3>Guidelines to Authors for Figures</h3>
<p>Figures (line diagrams and photographs) should be clear, sharp and of good quality. We will normallyuse figuresassubmitted and it isthereforetheauthors’ responsibilitytoensure that the scientificdetails contained in them are correct.</p>
<p><strong>Please note the following important points:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li class="gap-above-small">Shading and fill patterns should be avoided wherever possible because diagrams containing them have to be printed as half-tones which maynot reproduce well. In graphs if it is necessary to distinguish between various curves, different types of lines,for example, solid, longdashes, large dots, alternate dashes and dots are recommended rather than lines of different thick-nesses.</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">When producing colour line illustrations, light colours such as yellow, light green, light blue, light grey, etc., should be avoided as they generally reproduce poorly in a black and white printing process.</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">Quality of reproduction will depend on resolution and size of figures. Low-resolution files do not reproduce well, especially when enlarged. Tone illustrations (in color or in black &amp; white),for e.g., photographs, paintings, etc., should be scanned at a high resolution(800dpi, if possible). Illustrations that have both line and tone should also be produced at a high resolution. The size of figures provided should be more or less in the final intended size that will appear in the journal, so that resizing can be avoided.</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">Wherever possible figures submitted as electronic files should be tightly cropped to minimize superfluous white space surrounding them. This reduces file sizes and helps the alignment of figures on the printed page.</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small">Fonts used should be restricted to standard font families (Times, Helvetica, Courier or Symbol), all letterings should be easy to read (7 or 8 point font size) and the thinnest line should be half a point.</li>
</ul>

<h3>File formats</h3>
<p>In order to get the best results we prefer TIFF files or encapsulated postscript (EPS) for figures. Files in other bitmap formats like BMP, GIF and JPEG are also acceptable. But please note that if the GIF and JPEG files have been downloaded from websites they may not be suitable for printing.</p>
