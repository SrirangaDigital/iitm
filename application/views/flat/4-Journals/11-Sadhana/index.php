<h3>Aim and Scope</h3>
<p>The journal covers all branches of engineering science and technology including mechanics (fluid, solid, thermal), computer science,   electronics, energy, aerospace technology, materials science, nuclear engineering, systems analysis, alternative technologies, etc.  The journal focuses on papers that are relevant to more than one professional group, either because the work is fundamental or because it reflects the best in current technology; also on summaries of special projects of interest to engineering scientists. The journal also encourages critical reviews, especially on subjects of interest to the country.
