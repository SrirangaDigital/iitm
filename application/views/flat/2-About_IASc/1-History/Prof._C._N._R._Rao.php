Work in Solid State Chemistry, Surface Science, Spectroscopy and Molecular Structure. Contributed widely to several aspects of spectroscopy and structure by employing vibrational, electronic and high-energy spectroscopies. Besides complex molecules, has investigated molecular interactions by these techniques. An important area of vital interest to which monumental contributions have been made is solid state chemistry. In this area, carried out extensive studies related to tailor-making of complex solids, structure-property relations, defect solids, phase transitions, superconducting materials and novel synthetic methods. Also contributed significantly to surface science, fullerenes and metal clusters.
