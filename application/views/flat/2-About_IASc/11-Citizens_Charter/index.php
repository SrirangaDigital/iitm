In 2007, with the other two National Science Academies in the country (Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and The National Academy of Sciences, India, Allahabad) joining our programme, the activities of the Science Education Panel have now been greatly intensified. Summer Research Fellowships: Over 1300 summer research fellowships of 2-month duration were awarded to students and teachers all over the country in various disciplines to enable them to work with distinguished scientists of the country. Refresher Courses: This is an all India programme to help teachers in all disciplines of science to improve their background knowledge and teaching skills. The duration is two weeks and approximately 30 teachers undergo a rigorous course of lectures, discussions and problem-solving sessions. Lecture Workshops: Academy arranges two or three-day lecture programmes on carefully chosen topics in science at selected college and university departments for local students and teachers. Speakers include Fellows and others from nearby institutions.</li>
	<li class="gap-above-small"><strong>Panels on Scientific Values and Women in Science:</strong> As part of the Academy initiatives on topics of importance to scientists, two new panels were set up by the Academy - on "Scientific Values" and the other on "Women in Science".
