	<li>After preparation of this document, there has been considerable discussion of a proposal to set up a National Science University (NSU), (cf Current Science, Vol. 67, pp5O2-519, 10 October 1994). In Council's view, the proposals contained in the present document are wider in scope, more feasible, and take into account all aspects of this situation in a balanced way.</li>
