				<title>The sight of the peacock’s tail makes me sick: The early arguments on sexual selection</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0011-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Why does a peacock have a beautiful train, while a peahen is sober without such flamboyance? Darwin proposed the theory of sexual selection to explain the differences between the sexes of the same species. Recently the study of sexual selection has been one of the most flourishing areas in evolutionary biology. However, the theory met with great resistance from biologists since the publication of the idea and the history of the theory included a lot of misunderstanding and confusion. There are several reasons for this. First, classical Darwinism failed to recognize social competition as an important selective force. Second, the good-for-the-species argument, which persisted in the days after Darwin, made the sexual selection argument more difficult to understand. Compared to the discussions on animals, Darwin’s argument on human sex differences is not satisfactory. The reason probably lies in the debate over human racial differences which prevailed in the 19th century.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The involvement of the familial breast-ovarian cancer gene (<i>BRCA1</i>) in the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer among Indian women is unknown. We have used a set of microsatellite polymorphisms to examine the frequency of allele loss at the BRCA1 region on chromosome 17q21, in a panel of 80 human breast tumours. Tumour and blood leukocyte/normal tissue DNA from a series of 80 patients with primary breast cancer was screened by PCR-amplified microsatellite length polymorphisms to detect deletions at three polymorphic BRCA1 loci. PCR-allelotype was valuable in examining allele losses from archival and small tumour samples. Loss of alleles at BRCA1 in the patient set, confirmed a noteworthy role of this gene in the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer and was in accordance with its well-documented tumour suppressive function.</p>

				<title>Growth modulation of fibroblasts by chitosan-polyvinyl pyrrolidone hydrogel: Implications for wound management?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0025-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wounds in adults and fetuses differ in their healing ability with respect to scar formation. In adults, wounds lacking the epidermis exhibit excess collagen production and scar formation. Fibroblasts synthesize and deposit a collagen rich extracellular matrix. The early migration and proliferation of fibroblasts in the wound area is implicated in wound scarring. We have synthesized a hydrogel from chitosan-polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and examined its effect on fibroblast growth modulation <i>in vitro</i>. The hydrogel was found to be hydrophilic as seen from its octane contact angle (141·2 &#177; 0·37&#176;). The hydrogel was non-toxic and biocompatible with fibroblasts and epithelial cells as confirmed by the 3(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. It showed dual properties by supporting growth of epithelial cells (SiHa) and selectively inhibiting fibroblast (NIH3T3) growth. Growth inhibition of fibroblasts resulted from their inability to attach on to the hydrogel. These findings are supported by image analysis, which revealed a significant difference (𝑃 &#60; 0·05) between the number of fibroblasts attached to the hydrogel in tissue culture as compared to tissue culture treated polystyrene (TCPS) controls. However, no significant difference was observed (𝑃 &#62; 0·05) in the number of epithelial (SiHa) cells attached on to the hydrogel as compared to the TCPS control. Although <i>in vivo</i> experiments are awaited, these findings point to the possible use of chitosan-PVP hydrogels in wound-management.</p>

				<title>PTP-S2, a nuclear tyrosine phosphatase, is phosphorylated and excluded from condensed chromosomes during mitosis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0033-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>PTP-S2 is a tyrosine specific protein phosphatase that binds to DNA and is localized to the nucleus in association with chromatin. It plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation. Here we show that the subcellular distribution of this protein changes during cell division. While PTP-S2 was localized exclusively to the nucleus in interphase cells, during metaphase and anaphase it was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and excluded from condensed chromosomes. At telophase PTP-S2 began to associate with chromosomes and at cytokinesis it was associated with chromatin in the newly formed nucleus. It was hyperphosphorylated and showed retarded mobility in cells arrested in metaphase. <i>In vitro</i> experiments showed that it was phosphorylated by CK2 resulting in mobility shift. Using a deletion mutant we found that CK2 phosphorylated PTP-S2 in the C-terminal non-catalytic domain. A heparin sensitive kinase from mitotic cell extracts phosphorylated PTP-S2 resulting in mobility shift. These results are consistent with the suggestion that during metaphase PTP-S2 is phosphorylated (possibly by CK2 or a CK2-like enzyme), resulting in its dissociation from chromatin.</p>

				<page>0047-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) induces human peripheral blood monocytes to secrete a chemotactic cytokine [human macrophage-derived factor (hMDF)] which causes chemotaxis of neutrophils. The only known assay for hMDF cannot quantify its level in samples, so an enzyme immunoassay has been standardized for detection of hMDF and hMDF-specific antibodies in test samples. The reported enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was found to be sensitive (89%), specific (91%), accurate (92·2%) and reproducible and was able to detect a minimum concentration of 23 ng hMDF/ml in test samples. The chemotactic factor could be detected in JEV inoculated mouse sera and JEV infected culture fluids. Significant finding of the test was the detection of hMDF in sera of human cases of JE.</p>

				<title>A four-element based transposon system for allele specific tagging in plants – Theoretical considerations</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0057-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The two-element transposon constructs, utilizing either Ac/Ds or Spm/dSpm, allow random tagging of genes in heterologous model species, but are inadequate for directed tagging of specific alleles of agronomic importance. We propose the use of Ac/Ds in conjunction with Spm/dSpm to develop a four-element system for directed tagging of crop-specific alleles. The four-element based construct would include both Ds and dSpm along with relevant marker genes and would function in two steps. In the first step dSpm(Ds) stocks (a minimum of two) would be crossed to a line containing transposases of Spm and unlinked integrations would be selected from segregating population by the use of a negative selection marker to develop stocks representing integration of dSpm(Ds) at a large number of locations in the genome. Selections would be made for a line in which dSpm(Ds) shows partial or complete linkage to the allele of interest. In the second step selected line would be crossed to a line containing Ac transposase to induce transpositions of Ds element to linked sites thereby exploiting the natural tendency of Ds element to jump to linked sites. Unlinked jumps of dSpm(Ds) and linked jumps of Ds could be monitored by appropriate marker genes. The proposed model would allow tagging of allele of interest in chromosome addition lines and also help in the efficient use of genic male sterility systems for hybrid seed production by tightly marking the fertility restorer gene with a negative selection marker.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>To evaluate the role of phaseolinone, a phytotoxin produced by <i>Macrophomina phaseolina</i>, in disease initiation, three nontoxigenic avirulent mutants of the fungus were generated by UV-mutagenesis. Two of them were able to initiate infection in germinating <i>Phaseolus mungo</i> seeds only in the presence of phaseolinone. The minimum dose of phaseolinone required for infection in 30% seedlings was 2·5 𝜇g/ml. A human pathogen, <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> was also able to infect germinating seeds of <i>P. mungo</i> in the presence of 5 𝜇g/ml concentration of phaseolinone. Phaseolinone seemed to facilitate infection by <i>A. fumigatus</i>, which is not normally phytopathogenic, by reducing the immunity of germinating seedlings in a nonspecific way. Levamisole, a non-specific immunopotentiator gave protection against infection induced by <i>A. fumigatus</i> at an optimum dose of 50 𝜇g/ml. Sodium malonate prevented the effects of levamisole.</p>

				<title>Generation of deviation parameters for amino acid singlets, doublets and triplets from three-dimensional structures of proteins and its implications for secondary structure prediction from amino acid sequences</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0081-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a new method, secondary structure prediction by deviation parameter (SSPDP) for predicting the secondary structure of proteins from amino acid sequence. Deviation parameters (DP) for amino acid singlets, doublets and triplets were computed with respect to secondary structural elements of proteins based on the dictionary of secondary structure prediction (DSSP)-generated secondary structure for 408 selected non-homologous proteins. To the amino acid triplets which are not found in the selected dataset, a DP value of zero is assigned with respect to the secondary structural elements of proteins. The total number of parameters generated is 15,432, in the possible parameters of 25,260. Deviation parameter is complete with respect to amino acid singlets, doublets, and partially complete with respect to amino acid triplets. These generated parameters were used to predict secondary structural elements from amino acid sequence. The secondary structure predicted by our method (SSPDP) was compared with that of single sequence (NNPREDICT) and multiple sequence (PHD) methods. The average value of the percentage of prediction accuracy for α-helix by SSPDP, NNPREDICT and PHD methods was found to be 57%, 44% and 69% respectively for the proteins in the selected dataset. For 𝛽-strand the prediction accuracy is found to be 69%, 21% and 53% respectively by SSPDP, NNPREDICT and PHD methods. This clearly indicates that the secondary structure prediction by our method is as good as PHD method but much better than NNPREDICT method.</p>

				<title>Did fleshy fruit pulp evolve as a defence against seed loss rather than as a dispersal mechanism?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0093-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relatively few studies have examined the evolution of the mutualism between endozoochorous plants and seed dispersers. Most seed dispersal studies are ecological and examine the role of fruit pulp in promoting seed dispersal. This interaction is often assumed to have originated due to selection stemming from seed dispersers. Here I suggest a ``defence scenario” wherein fleshy fruits originated as mechanisms to defend seeds and secondarily became structures to promote seed dispersal. I suggest that frugivory followed from herbivores that specialized on consuming seed defensive tissues and that enhanced seed dispersal was initially a consequence of seed defence. The proposed defence scenario is not posited as an explanation for the sequence that led to all modern frugivores. However, it is suggested that seed predation was the initial source of selection that led to fleshy fruits; the necessary precursor to frugivory. Support is described from the fossil record and from modern structures and interactions. Testable predictions are made in hope that greater interest will be focused on the defensive role of fleshy fruit pulp both in modern interactions and historically.</p>

					<p>Capture-mark-recapture was used to study small mammal populations in tropical montane forests in southern India. Eleven plots in six montane forest patches were sampled from February–October, 1994. Six species were captured, including four rodents and two shrews. PROGRAM CAPTURE was used to derive estimates of density of the most abundant species in the study area, <i>Rattus rattus</i> Linnaeus. The coefficient of variation of the density estimate was used as an index of precision. The coefficient of variation decreased exponentially with increasing capture probability and with an increase in trapping duration. The coefficient of variation and the capture probability were not correlated with estimates of density. The density estimate increased with trapping duration, as did trap mortality. The latter may have been due to the trend of increased mortality with recaptures of the same individual, which in turn may have been due to weight loss over consecutive captures. Estimates of density derived using four estimators were different for 2, 3, 4 and 5 days of trapping. The coefficient of variation was highest for the generalized removal estimate and lowest for Darroch’s estimate. The models and estimators could not be applied to more than one species, and for this species, only in select habitats in a few seasons. Therefore, models of density estimation developed for temperate areas may not be suitable for tropical habitats due to low densities of small mammals in these habitats.</p>

				<title>Timing of surgery during the menstrual cycle and prognosis of breast cancer</title>
				<feature>Review article</feature>
				<page>0113-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are conflicting reports on the differential effect of surgery performed during the two phases of the menstrual cycle, namely, follicular and luteal, and prognosis of operable breast cancer. A statistical meta-analysis of the published evidence suggests a modest survival benefit of 15 &#177; 4% when the operation is performed during the lueteal phase. Further research in this area might provide a novel avenue to understand the natural history of breast cancer. A spin off from these studies might be the understanding of the importance of events that occur at the time of surgery in determining long term prognosis.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0143-0156</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The number of 𝛽-turns in a representative set of 426 protein three-dimensional crystal structures selected from the recent Protein Data Bank has nearly doubled and the number of 𝛾-turns in a representative set of 320 proteins has increased over seven times since the previous analysis. 𝛽-turns (7153) and 𝛾-turns (911) extracted from these proteins were used to derive a revised set of type-dependent amino acid positional preferences and potentials. Compared with previous results, the preference for proline, methionine and tryptophan has increased and the preference for glutamine, valine, glutamic acid and alanine has decreased for 𝛽-turns. Certain new amino acid preferences were observed for both turn types and individual amino acids showed turn-type dependent positional preferences. The rationale for new amino acid preferences are discussed in the light of hydrogen bonds and other interactions involving the turns. Where main-chain hydrogen bonds of the type NH(𝑖 + 3)→CO(𝑖) were not observed for some 𝛽-turns, other main-chain hydrogen bonds or solvent interactions were observed that possibly stabilize such 𝛽-turns. A number of unexpected isolated 𝛽-turns with proline at 𝑖 + 2 position were also observed. The NH(𝑖 + 2)→CO(𝑖) hydrogen bond was observed for almost all 𝛾-turns. Nearly 20% classic 𝛾-turns and 43% inverse 𝛾-turns are isolated turns.</p>

				<title>Effect of pH and temperature on the binding of bilirubin to human erythrocyte membranes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0157-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effect of pH and temperature on the binding of bilirubin to human erythrocyte membranes was studied by incubating the membranes at different pH and temperatures and determining the bound bilirubin. At all pH values, the amount of membrane-bound bilirubin increased with the increase in bilirubin-to-albumin molar ratios (B/As), being highest at lower pH values in all cases. Further, linear increase in bound bilirubin with the increase in bilirubin concentration in the incubate was observed at a constant B/A and at all pH values. However, the slope value increased with the decrease in pH suggesting more bilirubin binding to membranes at lower pH values. Increase in bilirubin binding at lower pH can be explained on the basis of increased free bilirubin concentration as well as more conversion of bilirubin dianion to monoanion. Temperature dependence of bilirubin binding to membranes was observed within the temperature range of 7&#176;–60&#176;C, showing minimum binding at 27&#176;C and 37&#176;C which increased on either side. Increase in bilirubin binding at temperatures lower than 20&#176;C and higher than 40&#176;C can be ascribed to the change in membrane topography as well as bilirubin-albumin interaction.</p>

				<page>0163-0172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using light microscope and scanning electron microscope, the external morphological characteristics of the antennal flagellum and its sensilla are described in the sandfly, <i>Phlebotomus argentipes</i> Annandale and Brunetti sensu lato, a well known vector of visceral leishmaniasis in India. A revised terminology is given for the antennal segments to bring phlebotomine more in line with other subfamilies and families while a description of antennal sensilla is provided for the first time in phlebotomine sandflies. Each flagellum consists of scape, pedicel, flagellomeres I to XIII and apiculus. The antennal segments contain scales and sensilla and the latter consist of <i>sensilla trichodea, s. basiconica, s. auricillica, s. coeloconica</i> and <i>s. chaetica</i> and their putative functions are discussed.</p>
					<p>The <i>sensilla chaeticum</i> hitherto known as antennal ascoid in the phlebotomine sandflies was used to differentiate within and between species. Differences in its relative size to the flagellomere between the populations of <i>P. argentipes</i> collected from the endemic and non-endemic areas in Tamil Nadu state, southern India were established. These differences are considered to be a character displacement as means of premating reproductive isolating mechanism among the populations/members of species complex.</p>

				<title>The structure of the nasal chemosensory system in squamate reptiles. 1. The olfactory organ, with special reference to olfaction in geckos</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0173-0179</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The luminal surface of the chemosensory epithelia of the main olfactory organ of terrestrial vertebrates is covered by a layer of fluid. The source of this fluid layer varies among vertebrates. Little is known regarding the relative development of the sources of fluid (sustentacular cells and Bowman’s glands) in reptiles, especially in gekkotan lizards (despite recent assertions of olfactory speciality). This study examined the extent and morphology of the main olfactory organ in several Australian squamate reptiles, including three species of gekkotans, two species of skinks and one snake species. The olfactory mucosa of two gekkotan species (<i>Christinus marmoratus</i> and <i>Strophurus intermedius</i>) is spread over a large area of the nasal cavity. Additionally, the sustentacular cells of all three gekkotan species contained a comparatively reduced number of secretory granules, in relation to the skinks or snake examined. These observations imply that the gekkotan olfactory system may function differently from that of either skinks or snakes. Similar variation in secretory granule abundance was previously noted between mammalian and non-mammalian olfactory sustentacular cells. The observations in gekkotans suggests that the secretory capacity of the non-mammalian olfactory sustentacular cells show far more variation than initially thought.</p>

				<title>The structure of the nasal chemosensory system in squamate reptiles. 2. Lubricatory capacity of the vomeronasal organ</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0181-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The vomeronasal organ is a poorly understood accessory olfactory organ, present in many tetrapods. In mammals, amphibians and lepidosaurian reptiles, it is an encapsulated structure with a central, fluid-filled lumen. The morphology of the lubricatory system of the vomeronasal organ (the source of this fluid) varies among classes, being either intrinsic (mammalian and caecilian amphibian vomeronasal glands) or extrinsic (anuran and urodele nasal glands). In the few squamate reptiles thus far examined, there are no submucosal vomeronasal glands. In this study, we examined the vomeronasal organs of several species of Australian squamates using histological, histochemical and ultrastructural techniques, with the goal of determining the morphology of the lubricatory system in the vomeronasal organ. Histochemically, the fluid within the vomeronasal organ of all squamates is mucoserous, though it is uncertain whether mucous and serous constituents constitute separate components. The vomeronasal organ produces few secretory granules intrinsically, implying an extrinsic source for the luminal fluid. Of three possible candidates, the Harderian gland is the most likely extrinsic source of this secretion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>One cannot assume that resemblances between the mechanical devices of human technology and those produced by the evolutionary process reflect either specific copying of nature by people or some particular point of functional superiority. A third alternative is that the two mechanical contexts derive quite different advantages from a given arrangement. While this latter might appear unlikely, one can argue that it underlies such things as the use of conical shapes, helical tensile structures, spheres and cylinders, beams and columns of relatively low torsional stiffness, and geodesic shells.</p>

				<title>Patterns of replication in the neo-sex chromosomes of <i>Drosophila nasuta albomicans</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0229-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Drosophila nasuta albomicans</i> (with 2n = 6), contains a pair of metacentric neo-sex chromosomes. Phylogenetically these are products of centric fusion between ancestral sex (X, Y) chromosomes and an autosome (chromosome 3). The polytene chromosome complement of males with a neo-X- and neo-Y-chromosomes has revealed asynchrony in replication between the two arms of the neo-sex chromosomes. The arm which represents the ancestral X-chromosome is faster replicating than the arm which represents ancestral autosome. The latter arm of the neo-sex chromosome is synchronous with other autosomes of the complement. We conclude that one arm of the neo-X/Y is still mimicking the features of an autosome while the other arm has the features of a classical X/Y-chromosome. This X-autosome translocation differs from the other evolutionary X-autosome translocations known in certain species of <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>

				<title>Cytokeratin expression in human fetal tongue and buccal mucosa</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0235-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Expression of cytokeratins (CK), a subset of intermediate filament (IF) proteins in epithelia, is developmentally regulated. CK expression may also change after malignant transformation. Our earlier studies on CK expression in human oral tumours and pre-cancerous lesions have shown specific changes in CK expression. We analysed CK expression in human tongue and buccal mucosa (BM) in fetuses in the embryonic age group of 16 to 27 weeks using biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques to find out whether there is any similarity in CK expression in human oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and fetal oral tissues. CK 1, 8 and 18 were detected in a majority of samples using both techniques. Our earlier studies had shown aberrant expression of CK 1 and 18 in many of the oral SCC and leukoplakias. Studies by immunohistochemistry showed that these different CK antigens were expressed in different cell layers. CK 1(2) were present in the stratified epithelial layers whereas CK 8 and 18 were restricted to glandular epithelium. Till 27 weeks of gestation, both tongue and BM expressed CK 1, 8 and 18 along with CK 6 and 16. Thus, fetal tissues showed some similarities in CK pattern with their respective SCC.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of cAMP-induced H<sup>+</sup> -efflux of <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells: a role for fatty acids</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0243-0252</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aggregating <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells release protons when stimulated with cAMP. To find out whether the protons are generated by acidic vesicles or in the cytosol, we permeabilized the cells and found that this did not alter the cAMP-response. Proton efflux in intact cells was inhibited by preincubation with the V-type H<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A and with the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> ATPase blocker miconazole. Surprisingly, miconazole also inhibited efflux in permeabilized cells, indicating that this type of H<sup>+</sup> ATPase is present on intracellular vesicles as well. Vesicular acidification was inhibited by miconazole and by concanamycin A, suggesting that the acidic vesicles contain both V-type and P-type H<sup>+</sup> ATPases. Moreover, concanamycin A and miconazole acted in concert, both in intact cells and in vesicles. The mechanism of cAMP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-fluxes involves phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity. Fatty acids circumvent the plasma membrane and stimulate vesicular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-efflux. Here we show that arachidonic acid elicited H<sup>+</sup>-efflux not only from intact cells but also from acidic vesicles. The target of regulation by arachidonic acid seemed to be the vesicular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-relase channel.</p>

				<title>Role of light in the mediation of acute effects of a single afternoon melatonin injection on steroidogenic activity of testis in the rat</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0253-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Young adult male rats, maintained either in an LD 12 : 12 or in continuous illumination (LL) for one week, were given a single injection of 25 𝜇g melatonin/100 g body wt or ethanolic-saline (control) at 17.00 h. Animals from each group were sacrificed at 11.00 h on the following day. The activity of two important steroidogenic enzymes, 17𝛽-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17𝛽-HSD) and Δ<sup>5</sup>-3𝛽-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Δ<sup>5</sup>-3𝛽-HSD), and serum concentrations of testosterone, were measured following highly specific and sensitive spectrophotometric techniques and RIA, respectively. A significant decrease in the activity of both the steroidogenic enzymes was noted in the testes of melatonin-treated rats maintained under normal light-dark schedules, but this response was found to be lacking in the LL rats. However, no significant changes in the level of serum testosterone were noted in either group of melatonin-treated rats from the values in respective groups of ethanolic saline-administered LD and LL rats. Exposure of ethanolic saline-injected rats to continuous light also did not cause any change in the steroidogenic activity of the testis from those in LD rats. The study indicates that continuous light as such does not affect the endocrine function of testis but abolishes suppressive effects of melatonin on the steroidogenic activity of the testis in rat.</p>

				<title>Comparison of the genome sequences and the phylogenetic analyses of the GP78 and the Vellore P20778 isolates of Japanese encephalitis virus from India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0257-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleotide sequence of the complete genomes of two Indian isolates of Japanese encephalitis virus were compared. One of these isolates, GP78 was obtained from northern India in 1978. The other, the Vellore P20778 isolate, was obtained from southern India in 1958. There was 4.40% nucleotide sequence divergence between the two Indian isolates that resulted in a 1.86% amino acid sequence divergence. Phylogenetic analyses showed that in evolutionary terms the north Indian GP78 isolate was close to the SA14 isolate from China whereas the south Indian Vellore P20778 isolate was close to the Beijing-1 isolate, also from China. The two Indian isolates, however, appear to have evolved independently.</p>

				<title>Positive correlation between menthol content and in <i>vitro</i> menthol tolerance in Mentha arvensis L. cultivars</title>

				<page>0263-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Menthol is a highly valued monoterpene produced by Japanese mint (<i>Mentha arvensis</i>) as a natural product with wide applications in cosmetics, confectionery, flavours, beverages and therapeutics. Selection of high menthol yielding genotypes is therefore the ultimate objective of all genetic improvement programmes in <i>Mentha arvensis</i>. A positive correlation was observed in the present study between menthol content in oils of evaluated genotypes and the level of tolerance to externally supplied menthol of explants of these genotypes in culture medium. The easy use of this relationship as a selectable biochemical marker opens the practical applicability of large-scale <i>in vitro</i> screening of the germplasm, clones and breeders’ material for selection of elite genotypes.</p>

				<title>The ontogeny of kin recognition in tadpoles of the toad <i>Bufo melanostictus</i> (Anura; Bufonidae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0267-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ontogeny of kin recognition and influence of social environment on the development of kin recognition behaviour was experimentally investigated in tadpoles of Bufo melanostictus that lived in aggregations and showed low larval dispersion. Embryos and tadpoles of the toad were reared as</p>
					<ol>
						<li>kin only,</li>
						<li>with kin and non-kin (separated by a mesh screen), and</li>
						<li>in isolation.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>They were tested for the ability to discriminate between</p>
					<ol>
						<li>familiar siblings and unfamiliar non-siblings,</li>
						<li>familiar siblings and familiar non-siblings and,</li>
						<li>unfamiliar siblings and unfamiliar non-siblings.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>All tadpoles were fed on boiled spinach before conducting trials. Preference of test tadpoles to associate near the end compartments whether empty or containing members of specific stimulus groups was assessed using a rectangular choice tank. When tested in tanks with empty end compartments, the test tadpoles showed random distribution and thus no bias for the apparatus or the procedure. In the presence of kin/non-kin in the end compartments a significantly greater number of test tadpoles spent the majority of the time near familiar or unfamiliar kin rather than near familiar or unfamiliar non-kin. Kin discrimination ability persisted throughout larval development. Familiarity with siblings is not required for discriminating kin from non-kin, and kin discrimination ability is not modified following exposure to non-kin. Also, involvement of dietary cues is unlikely to be the prime mechanism of kin recognition in <i>B. melanostictus</i> unlike in some other anurans.</p>

				<title>Mechanisms of all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid-induced differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells</title>
				<feature>Review articles</feature>
				<page>0275-0284</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Retinoic acids (RA) play a key role in myeloid differentiation through their agonistic nuclear receptors (RAR𝛼/RXR) to modulate the expression of target genes. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells with rearrangement of retinoic acid receptor 𝛼 (RAR𝛼) (including: PML-RAR𝛼, PLZF-RAR𝛼, NPM-RAR𝛼, NuMA-RAR𝛼 or STAT5b-RAR𝛼) as a result of chromosomal translocations, the RA signal pathway is disrupted and myeloid differentiation is arrested at the promyelocytic stage. Pharmacologic dosage of all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid (ATRA) directly modulates PML-RAR𝛼 and its interaction with the nuclear receptor co-repressor complex, which restores the wild-type RAR𝛼/RXR regulatory pathway and induces the transcriptional expression of downstream  genes. Analysing gene expression profiles in APL cells before and after ATRA treatment represents a useful approach to identify genes whose functions are involved in this new cancer treatment. A chronologically well coordinated modulation of ATRA-regulated genes has thus been revealed which seems to constitute a balanced functional network underlying decreased cellular proliferation, initiation and progression of maturation, and maintenance of cell survival before terminal differentiation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The visual and auditory systems are two major sensory modalities employed in communication. Although communication in these two sensory modalities can serve analogous functions and evolve in response to similar selection forces, the two systems also operate under different constraints imposed by the environment and the degree to which these sensory modalities are recruited for non-communication functions. Also, the research traditions in each tend to differ, with studies of mechanisms of acoustic communication tending to take a more reductionist tack often concentrating on single signal parameters, and studies of visual communication tending to be more concerned with multivariate signal arrays in natural environments and higher level processing of such signals. Each research tradition would benefit by being more expansive in its approach.</p>

				<title>Role of polyamines and ethylene as modulators of plant senescence</title>
				<feature>Review articles</feature>
				<page>0291-0299</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Under optimal conditions of growth, senescence, a terminal phase of development, sets in after a certain physiological age. It is a dynamic and closely regulated developmental process which involves an array of changes at both physiological and biochemical levels including gene expression. A large number of biotic and abiotic factors accelerate the process. Convincing evidence suggests the involvement of polyamines (PAs) and ethylene in this process. Although the biosynthetic pathways of both PAs and ethylene are interrelated, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) being a common precursor, their physiological functions are distinct and at times antagonistic, particularly during leaf and flower senescence and also during fruit ripening. This provides an effective means for regulation of their biosynthesis and also to understand the mechanism by which the balance between the two can be established for manipulating the senescence process. The present article deals with current advances in the knowledge of the interrelationship between ethylene and PAs during senescence which may open up new vistas of investigation for the future.</p>

				<title>Decapod crustacean chelipeds: an overview</title>
				<feature>Review articles</feature>
				<page>0301-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The structure, growth, differentiation and function of crustacean chelipeds are reviewed. In many decapod crustaceans growth of chelae is isometric with allometry level reaching unity till the puberty moult. Afterwards the same trend continues in females, while in males there is a marked spurt in the level of allometry accompanied by a sudden increase in the relative size of chelae. Subsequently they are differentiated morphologically into crusher and cutter making them heterochelous and sexually dimorphic. Of the two, the major chela is used during agonistic encounters while the minor is used for prey capture and grooming. Various biotic and abiotic factors exert a negative effect on cheliped growth. The dimorphic growth pattern of chelae can be adversely affected by factors such as parasitic infection and substrate conditions. Display patterns of chelipeds have an important role in agonistic and aggressive interactions. Of the five pairs of pereiopods, the chelae are versatile organs of offence and defence which also make them the most vulnerable for autotomy. Regeneration of the autotomized chelipeds imposes an additional energy demand called “<i>regeneration load</i>” on the incumbent, altering energy allocation for somatic and/or reproductive processes. Partial withdrawal of chelae leading to incomplete exuviation is reported for the first time in the laboratory and field in <i>Macrobrachium</i> species.</p>

				<title>Cognitive empathy in inter-disciplinary research: the contrasting attitudes of plant breeders and molecular biologists towards rice</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0323-0330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>I draw attention to the perceptions of and interactions between molecular biologists and scientists engaged in plant breeding in India, who have been attempting to employ molecular biology tools to understand and intervene to improve the rice crop. The present essay suggests that the concept of cognitive empathy is crucial for enabling basic scientists and applied scientists to begin to understand phenomena from the point of view of the other and from the point of view of society at large, and in arriving at solutions that are scientifically feasible and socially acceptable. Socialization into disciplinary cultures, organizational factors and individual anxieties seem to inhibit inter-disciplinary collaboration. The majority of rice breeders and a small group of molecular biologists emphasize the relative merits of marker-assisted selection (MAS) in the near term vis-à-vis the currently controversial transgenic approach for rice crop improvement in India.</p>

				<title>Enhanced expression of a calcium-dependent protein kinase from the moss <i>Funaria hygrometrica</i> under nutritional starvation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0331-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Among the downstream targets of calcium in plants, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) form an interesting class of kinases which are activated by calcium binding. They have been implicated in a diverse array of responses to hormonal and environmental stimuli. In order to dissect the role of CDPKs in the moss <i>Funaria hygrometrica</i>, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach was adopted to clone the gene. Using degenerate PCR primers against conserved regions of CDPKs, a 900 bp amplicon was obtained from the genomic DNA of <i>Funaria</i>. Southern hybridization under low stringency conditions indicated the presence of several CDPK related sequences in the <i>Funaria</i> genome. This observation is consistent with reports of multigene families of CDPKs in other plants. The 900 bp fragment was subsequently used to isolate a 2.2 kb partial genomic clone of the CDPK gene from <i>Funaria</i>. The genomic clone encodes an open reading frame (ORF) of 518 amino acids. Interestingly, unlike other CDPK genes from plants, the entire 1.5 kb ORF is not interrupted by introns. The deduced amino acid sequence of the <i>Funaria</i> gene shows extensive homology with CDPKs from higher plants, 73% identity with the <i>Fragaria</i> CDPK and 71% identity with CDPK isoform 7 of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the <i>Funaria</i> CDPK is closer to the CDPKs from higher plants like strawberry and <i>Arabidopsis</i> as compared to those from lower plants such as the liverwort <i>Marchantia</i>, the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas</i> or another moss <i>Tortula</i>. Northern analysis shows enhanced expression of the CDPK transcript within 24–48 h of starvation for nitrogen, phosphorus or sulphur. So far the only other kinase which is known to be induced by nutrient starvation in plants is the wpk 4 which is a snf-1 related kinase (SnRKs). To our knowledge this is the first report that implicates a CDPK in the starvation response.</p>

				<title>Tyrosine phosphorylation of the human guanylyl cyclase C receptor</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0339-0346</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tyrosine phosphorylation events are key components of several cellular signal transduction pathways. This study describes a novel method for identification of substrates for tyrosine kinases. Co-expression of the tyrosine kinase EphB1 with the intracellular domain of guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of GCC, indicating that GCC is a potential substrate for tyrosine kinases. Indeed, GCC expressed in mammalian cells is tyrosine phosphorylated, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in regulation of GCC signalling. This is the first demonstration of tyrosine phosphorylation of any member of the family of membrane-associated guanylyl cyclases.</p>

				<title>Domain III function of Mu transposase analysed by directed placement of subunits within the transpososome</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0347-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Assembly of the functional tetrameric form of Mu transposase (MuA protein) at the two att ends of Mu depends on interaction of MuA with multiple att and enhancer sites on supercoiled DNA, and is stimulated by MuB protein. The N-terminal domain I of MuA harbours distinct regions for interaction with the att ends and enhancer; the C-terminal domain III contains separate regions essential for tetramer assembly and interaction with MuB protein (III𝛼 and III𝛽, respectively). Although the central domain II (the ‘DDE’ domain) of MuA harbours the known catalytic DDE residues, a 26 amino acid peptide within III𝛼 also has a non-specific DNA binding and nuclease activity which has been implicated in catalysis. One model proposes that active sites for Mu transposition are assembled by sharing structural/catalytic residues between domains II and III present on separate MuA monomers within the MuA tetramer. We have used substrates with altered att sites and mixtures of MuA proteins with either wild-type or altered att DNA binding specificities, to create tetrameric arrangements wherein specific MuA subunits are nonfunctional in II, III𝛼 or III𝛽 domains. From the ability of these oriented tetramers to carry out DNA cleavage and strand transfer we conclude that domain III𝛼 or III𝛽 function is not unique to a specific subunit within the tetramer, indicative of a structural rather than a catalytic function for domain III in Mu transposition.</p>

				<title>Sequence analysis of mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragment from seven mosquito species</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0361-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mosquitoes are vectors for the transmission of many human pathogens that include viruses, nematodes and protozoa. For the understanding of their vectorial capacity, identification of disease carrying and refractory strains is essential. Recently, molecular taxonomic techniques have been utilized for this purpose. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene has been used for molecular taxonomy in many insects. In this paper, we have analysed a 450 bp hypervariable region of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene in three major genera of mosquitoes, <i>Aedes, Anopheles</i> and <i>Culex</i>. The sequence was found to be unusually A + T rich and in substitutions the rate of transversions was higher than the transition rate. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with these sequences. An interesting feature of the sequences was a stretch of Ts that distinguished between <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Culex</i> on the one hand, and <i>Anopheles</i> on the other. This is the first report of mitochondrial rRNA sequences from these medically important genera of mosquitoes.</p>

				<title>On the patterns of abundance and diversity of macrolichens of Chopta-Tunganath in the Garhwal Himalaya</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0367-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A total of 3211 colonies of macrolichens, from twelve 50 m &#215; 10 m plots distributed across four macrohabitat (vegetation) types between 1500 m–3700 m in the Chopta-Tunganath landscape of the Garhwal Himalaya, yielded 13 families with 15 genera and 85 species. <i>Lobaria retigera</i> stood out as a broad-niched generalist species with moderate levels of abundance in all the three major microhabitats, viz. rock, soil and wood across 83% of all the plots sampled, whereas <i>Umbilicaria indica</i> emerged as an abundantly occurring specialist confined to rock substrates. <i>Heterodermia incana</i> and <i>Leptogium javanicum</i> appeared to be rare members of the community as they were encountered only once during the field survey. Woody microhabitats turned out to be richer than rock and soil substrates for macrolichens. Amongst the macrohabitats, middle altitude (2500–2800 m) <i>Quercus</i> forest was richest in species and genera followed by high altitude (2900–3200 m) <i>Rhododendron</i> forest, higher altitude grasslands (3300–3700 m) and then the lower elevation (1500 m) <i>Quercus</i> forest. Species, genus and family level alpha- as well as beta-diversities were significantly correlated with each other, implying that higher taxonomic ranks such as genera may be used as surrogates for species thus facilitating cost- and time-effective periodic monitoring of the biodiversity of macrolichens. Dynamics of the diversity of lichen communities in relation to various forms of environmental disturbance including livestock grazing and tourism as dominant land use activities in the higher Himalaya need further research.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A study on the microarthropod community with special reference to species diversity of Oribatid and Collembola communities (Microarthropoda: Oribatei and Collembola) in Tam Dao National Park of Vietnam, a subtropical evergreen broad leaf alpine forest, was undertaken with the aim to explain how they are related to forest decline, and whether they can be used as bioindicators of forest plant succession.</p>
					<p>The results have shown that microarthropod community structures, particularly species diversity of oribatid and collembolan communities, are related to forest decline. Therefore they can be used as bioindicators of forest plant succession. In Tam Dao National Park, there was an inverse relation between species diversity of the oribatid and collembola communities. The species diversity of the oribatid community gradually decreased with forest decline whereas the species diversity of the collembola community gradually increased.</p>

				<page>0387-0396</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acoustic signals play an important role in the lives of birds. Almost all avian species produce vocal signals in a variety of contexts either in the form of calls or songs or both. In the present study different types of vocal signals of the tropical avian species <i>Pycnonotus cafer</i> were characterized on the basis of their physical characteristics and context of production. This species used six types of vocal signals: contact signals, roosting signals, alarm signals, twittering signals, distress signals and begging signals. Two types of alarm signals are produced based on predation pressure. These signals are dissimilar in all physical characteristics except for dominant frequency. Although alarm signal type I and roosting signals are phonetically similar, they have completely different sonogram characteristics.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of store-operated calcium entry</title>
				<feature>Mini Review</feature>
				<page>0397-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Activation of receptors coupled to the phospholipase C/IP<sub>3</sub> signalling pathway results in a rapid release of calcium from its intracellular stores, eventually leading to depletion of these stores. Calcium store depletion triggers an influx of extracellular calcium across the plasma membrane, a mechanism known as the store-operated calcium entry or capacitative calcium entry. Capacitative calcium current plays a key role in replenishing calcium stores and activating various physiological processes. Despite considerable efforts, very little is known about the molecular nature of the capacitative channel and the signalling pathway that activates it. This review summarizes our current knowledge about store operated calcium entry and suggests possible hypotheses for its mode of activation.</p>

				<title>Developmental regulation and complex organization of the promoter of the non-coding <i>hsr</i>𝜔 gene of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleus-limited large non-coding hsrω-n RNA product of the <i>93D</i> or the <i>hsrω</i> gene of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> binds to a variety of RNA-binding proteins involved in nuclear RNA processing. We examined the developmental and heat shock induced expression of this gene by <i>in situ</i> hybridization of nonradioactively labelled riboprobe to cellular transcripts in intact embryos, larval and adult somatic tissues of wild type and an enhancer-trap line carrying the <i>hsrω</i><sup><i>05241</i></sup> allele due to insertion of a <i>P-LacZ-rosy</i><sup>+</sup> transposon at &#8212; 130 bp position of the <i>hsrω</i> promoter. We also examined <i>LacZ</i> expression in the enhancer-trap line and in two transgenic lines carrying different lengths of the <i>hsrω</i> promoter upstream of the <i>LacZ</i> reporter. The <i>hsrω</i> gene is expressed widely at all developmental stages; in later embryonic stages, its expression in the developing central nervous system was prominent. In spite of insertion of a big transposon in the promoter, expression of the <i>hsrω</i><sup><i>05241</i></sup> allele in the enhancer-trap line, as revealed by <i>in situ</i> hybridization to hsrω transcripts in cells, was similar to that of the wild type allele in all the embryonic, larval and adult somatic tissues examined. Expression of the <i>LacZ</i> gene in this enhancer-trap line was similar to that of the <i>hsrω</i> RNA in all diploid cell types in embryos and larvae but in the polytene cells, the <i>LacZ</i> gene did not express at all, neither during normal development nor after heat shock. Comparison of the expression patterns of <i>hsrω</i> gene and those of the <i>LacZ</i> reporter gene under its various promoter regions in the enhancer-trap and transgenic lines revealed a complex pattern of regulation, which seems to be essential for its dynamically varying expression in diverse cell types.</p>

				<title>Characterization of chicken riboflavin carrier protein gene structure and promoter regulation by estrogen</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0039-0046</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chicken riboflavin carrier protein (RCP) is an estrogen induced egg yolk and white protein. Eggs from hens which have a splice mutation in RCP gene fail to hatch, indicating an absolute requirement of RCP for the transport of riboflavin to the oocyte. In order to understand the mechanism of regulation of this gene by estrogen, the chicken RCP gene including 1 kb of the 5&#8242; flanking region has been isolated. Characterization of the gene structure shows that it contains six exons and five introns, including an intron in the 5&#8242; untranslated region. Sequence analysis of the 5&#8242; flanking region does not show the presence of any classical, palindromic estrogen response element (ERE). However, there are six half site ERE consensus elements. Four deletion constructs of the 5&#8242; flanking region with varying number of ERE half sites were made in pGL3 basic vector upstream of the luciferase-coding region. Transient transfection of these RCP promoter deletion constructs into a chicken hepatoma cell line (LMH2A) showed 6-12-fold transcriptional induction by a stable estrogen analogue, moxesterol. This suggests that the RCP gene is induced by estrogen even in the absence of a classical ERE and the half sites of ERE in this promoter may be important for estrogen induction.</p>

				<title>Early localization of NPA58, a rat nuclear pore-associated protein, to the reforming nuclear envelope during mitosis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0047-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the mitotic reassembly of the nuclear envelope, using antibodies to nuclear marker proteins and NPA58 in F-111 rat fibroblast cells. In earlier studies we have proposed that NPA58, a 58 kDa rat nuclear protein, is involved in nuclear protein import. In this report, NPA58 is shown to be localized on the cytoplasmic face of the envelope in interphase cells, in close association with nuclear pores. In mitotic cells NPA58 is dispersed in the cytoplasm till anaphase. The targeting of NPA58 to the reforming nuclear envelope in early telophase coincides with the recruitment of a well-characterized class of nuclear pore proteins recognized by the antibody mAb 414, and occurs prior to the incorporation of lamin B1 into the envelope. Significant protein import activity is detectable only after localization of NPA58 in the newly-formed envelope. The early targeting of NPA58 is consistent with its proposed role in nuclear transport.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The pleiotropic properties of a <i>abo abo</i> (Abo<sup>–</sup>) 𝛾-ray induced mutant of <i>Catharanthus roseuscv</i>. Nirmal, selected among the M<sub>2</sub> generation seeds for ability to germinate at 45&#176;C, are described. The mutant produced seeds possessing tricotyledonous embryos, unlike the typically dicotyledonous embryos present in the wild type Abo<sup>+</sup> seeds. In comparison to Abo<sup>+</sup> adults, the mutant plants had short stature and lanceolate leaves. The vascular bundles in the leaves and stem were poorly developed. Leaf surfaces were highly trichomatous, epidermal, cortex and mesophyll cells were small sized and a large majority of stomata were closed. Besides high temperature, the mutant was salinity and water-stress tolerant. The abscisic acid (ABA) content in the leaves was about 500-fold higher. The genetic lesion abo responsible for the above pleiotropy was recessive and inherited in Mendelian fashion. The seedlings and adult plants of the mutant accumulated higher proline than Abo<sup>+</sup> plants. The phenotypes of <i>abo abo</i> mutants permitted the conclusions that</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the mutant synthesizes ABA constitutively,</li>
						<li>both ABA-dependent and ABA independent pathways for proline and betaine accumulation are functional in the mutant, and</li>
						<li>cell division, elongation and differentiation processes in embryo and adult plant stages are affected in the mutant.</li>

				<title>Incipient sexual isolation in the <i>nasuta-albomicans</i> complex of <i>Drosophila</i>: No-choice experiments</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0071-0076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Drosophila nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>Drosophila nasuta albomicans</i> are cross-fertile races of <i>Drosophila</i>. Hybridization between these races in the laboratory has given rise to new races (Cytoraces), among which karyotypic composition differs from one another and also from those of the parental races. In this study, we search for the evidence of incipient reproductive isolation among the parental races and four Cytoraces by assessing the fraction of no-matings, mating latency and copulation duration in all possible types of homo- and heterogamic crosses (𝑁 = 4184). In no-choice conditions, the latency time (time to initiation of copulation) is lower in homogamic crosses than in heterogamic crosses for both parental races and Cytoraces. Latency time and copulation duration are negatively correlated, whereas fraction of no matings is positively correlated with latency time. Thus these six closely related races of the <i>nasuta-albomicans</i> complex show the initiation of the earliest stages of pre-zygotic isolation, manifested as a tendency for matings to be initiated earlier and more often, and for a longer duration, among homogamic rather than heterogamic individuals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Living organisms are not just random collections of organic molecules. There is continuous information processing going on in the apparent bouncing around of molecules of life. Optimization criteria in this information processing can be searched for using the laws of physics. Quantum dynamics can explain why living organisms have 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino acids, as optimal solutions of the molecular assembly process. Experiments should be able to tell whether evolution indeed took advantage of quantum dynamics or not.</p>

				<title>Ammonia differentially suppresses the cAMP chemotaxis of anterior-like cells and prestalk cells in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0157-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A drop assay for chemotaxis to cAMP confirms that both anterior-like cells (ALC) and prestalk cells (pst cells) respond to cAMP gradients. We present evidence that the chemotactic response of both ALC and pst cells is suppressed by ammonia, but a higher concentration of ammonia is required to suppress the response in pst cells. ALC show a chemotactic response to cAMP when moving on a substratum of prespore cells in isolated slug posteriors incubated under oxygen. ALC chemotaxis on a prespore cell substratum is suppressed by the same concentration of ammonia that suppresses ALC chemotaxis on the agar substratum in drop assays. Chemotaxis suppression is mediated by the unprotonated (NH<sub>3</sub>) species of ammonia. The observed suppression, by ammonia, of ALC chemotaxis to cAMP supports our earlier hypothesis that ammonia is the tip-produced suppressor of such chemotaxis. We discuss implications of ammonia sensitivity of pst cells and ALC with regard to the movement and localization of ALC and pst cells in the slug and to the roles played by ALC in fruiting body formation. In addition, we suggest that a progressive decrease in sensitivity to ammonia is an important part of the maturation of ALC into pst cells.</p>

				<title>The wings of <i>Bombyx mori</i> develop from larval discs exhibiting an early differentiated state: a preliminary report</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0167-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lepidopteran insects present a complex organization of appendages which develop by various mechanisms. In the mulberry silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i> a pair of meso- and meta-thoracic discs located on either side in the larvae gives rise to the corresponding fore- and hind-wings of the adult. These discs do not experience massive cell rearrangements during metamorphosis and display the adult wing vein pattern. We have analysed wing development in <i>B. mori</i> by two approaches, viz., expression of patterning genes in larval wing discs, and regulatory capacities of larval discs following explantation or perturbation. Expression of Nubbin is seen all over the presumptive wing blade domains unlike in <i>Drosophila</i>, where it is confined to the hinge and the wing pouch. Excision of meso- and meta-thoracic discs during the larval stages resulted in emergence of adult moths lacking the corresponding wings without any loss of thoracic tissues suggesting independent origin of wing and thoracic primordia. The expression of wingless and distal-less along the dorsal/ventral margin in wing discs correlated well with their expression profile in adult <i>Drosophila</i> wings. Partially excised wing discs did not show <i>in situ</i> regeneration or duplication suggesting their early differentiation. The presence of adult wing vein patterns discernible in larval wing discs and the patterns of marker gene expression as well as the inability of these discs to regulate growth suggested that wing differentiation is achieved early in <i>B. mori</i>. The timings of morphogenetic events are different and the wing discs behave like presumptive wing buds opening out as wing blades in <i>B. mori</i> unlike evagination of only the pouch region as wing blades seen in <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>

				<title>Differential expression of syntaxin-1 and synaptophysin in the developing and adult human retina</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0179-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synaptophysin and syntaxin-1 are membrane proteins that associate with synaptic vesicles and presynaptic active zones at nerve endings, respectively. The former is known to be a good marker of synaptogenesis; this aspect, however, is not clear with syntaxin-1. In this study, the expression of both proteins was examined in the developing human retina and compared with their distribution in postnatal to adult retinas, by immunohistochemistry. In the inner plexiform layer, both were expressed simultaneously at 11–12 weeks of gestation, when synaptogenesis reportedly begins in the central retina. In the outer plexiform layer, however, the immunoreactivities were prominent by 16 weeks of gestation. Their expression in both plexiform layers followed a centre-to-periphery gradient. The immunoreactivities for both proteins were found in the immature photoreceptor, amacrine and ganglion cells; however, synaptophysin was differentially localized in bipolar cells and their axons, and syntaxin was present in some horizontal cells. In postnatal-to-adult retinas, synaptophysin immunoreactivity was prominent in photo-receptor terminals lying in the outer plexiform layer; on the contrary, syntaxin-1 was present in a thin immunoreactive band in this layer. In the inner plexiform layer, however, both were homogeneously distributed. Our study suggests that</p>
					<ol>
						<li>syntaxin-1 appears in parallel with synapse formation;</li>
						<li>synaptogenesis in the human retina might follow a centre-to-periphery gradient;</li> <li>syntaxin-1 is likely to be absent from ribbon synapses of the outer plexiform layer, but may occur at presynaptic terminals of photoreceptor and horizontal cells, as is apparent from its localization in these cells, which is hitherto unreported for any vertebrate retina.</li>

				<title>The <i>Escherichia coli</i> antiterminator protein BglG stabilizes the 5' region of the <i>bgl</i> mRNA</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0193-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 𝛽-glucoside utilization (<i>bgl</i>) genes of <i>Escherichia coli</i> are positively regulated by the product of the <i>bglG</i> gene, which functions as an antiterminator by binding to specific sequences present within the <i>bgl</i> mRNA. BglG is inactivated by phosphorylation in the absence of 𝛽-glucosides by BglF, the <i>bgl</i>-specific component of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Here, we present evidence for an additional function for BglG, namely the stabilization of the 5&#8212; end of the <i>bgl</i> mRNA. Half-life measurements of the promoter-proximal region of the <i>bgl</i> mRNA indicate a five fold enhancement of stability in the presence of active (unphosphorylated) BglG. This enhancement is lost when the binding of BglG to mRNA is prevented by deletion of the binding site. Interestingly, stabilization by BglG does not extend to downstream sequences. The enhanced stability of the upstream sequences suggest that BglG remains bound to its target on the mRNA even after the downstream sequences have been degraded. Implications of these observations for the mechanism of positive regulation of the operon by BglG are discussed.</p>

				<title>Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the primary motor cortex in humans: response to increased functional demands</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0205-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been performed on 20 right handed volunteers at 1.5 Tesla using echo planar imaging (EPI) protocol. Index finger tapping invoked localized activation in the primary motor area. Consistent and highly reproducible activation in the primary motor area was observed in six different sessions of a volunteer over a period of one month. Increased tapping rate resulted in increase in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity as well as the volume/area of activation (pixels) in the contralateral primary motor area up to tapping rate of 120 taps/min (2 Hz), beyond which it saturates. Activation in supplementary motor area was also observed. The obtained results are correlated to increased functional demands.</p>

				<title>Chromium uptake by <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and isolation of glucose tolerance factor from yeast biomass</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0217-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fermentations with yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> in semiaerobic and in static conditions with the addition of chromic chloride into the used molasses medium were analysed. It was proved that the addition of optimal amounts of CrCl<sub>3</sub> into the basal medium enhanced the kinetics of alcohol fermentations. The addition of 200 mg/l CrCl<sub>3</sub> into the medium stimulated both the yeast growth and the ethanol production in all experimental conditions. On the other hand, the results showed that Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions were incorporated into yeast cells during fermentation. Under these conditions the accumulation of Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions was performed by yeast cells during the exponential growth phase, and with enriched amounts of 30–45 𝜇g/g<sub>d.m.</sub> of cells.</p>
					<p>Yeast biomass enriched with chromium ions was extracted with 0.1 mol/l NH<sub>4</sub>OH assuming that the extracts had the glucose tolerance factor (GTF). Then the extracts were passed through a gel-filtration column in order to isolate and purify the GTF. The presence of GTF in the purified fractions was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.</p>
					<p>It is evident from the obtained results that the added purified fractions enhanced the rates of CO<sub>2</sub> production as well as the glucose utilization during alcoholic fermentation. As expected, the enhancement of both rates depended on the amounts of extracts added to the fermentation substrate. Thus, it is evident that purified extracts contained the GTF compound, and that Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions were bonded to the protein molecule.</p>

				<title>Dose-dependent differential effect of hemin on protein synthesis and cell proliferation in <i>Leishmania donovani</i> promastigotes cultured in <i>vitro</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0225-0231</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Leishmania donovani</i> requires an exogenous source of heme for growth and transformation. In <i>in vitro</i> culture of the free-living promastigotes, exogenously added hemin enhances cell proliferation. In this investigation, the question of the function of heme with particular reference to protein synthesis and cell proliferation has been addressed. The results of <i>in vitro</i> cell culture experiments demonstrated that hemin (10 𝜇M) alone is suitable for supporting optimum level of protein synthesis, and thereby cell proliferation of promastigotes to an extent that it can replace fetal bovine serum. However, <i>in situ</i> labelling experiments along with Western blots revealed that high concentration of hemin (50 𝜇M) reduced the level of protein synthesis in general and of 𝛽-tubulin in particular with a concomitant induction of hsp90, and induced consequent morphological changes that are observed during <i>in situ</i> transformation of promastigotes in mammalian macrophages. These results therefore suggest that sudden exposure to high concentration of heme in mammalian macrophages may be one of the key factors that trigger promastigote to amastigote transformation in <i>L. donovani</i>. Furthermore, hemin with its dual characteristic could be used as a tool to understand molecular mechanism of cell proliferation and transformation in these parasites.</p>

				<title>Chemistry of clitoral gland secretions of the laboratory rat: Assessment of behavioural response to identified compounds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0247-0252</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present investigations were carried out to find out the chemical nature of clitoral gland extracts and their involvement in reproductive and social behaviour. Homogenates of clitoral glands of mature estrous female rats were extracted with 𝑛-hexane and dichloromethane (1 : 1 ratio v/v) and analysed by gas chromatography linked mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Three peaks were found to be in higher concentration, which were identified as 6,11-dihydro-dibenz-b,e-oxepin-11-one (I); 2,6,10-dodecatrien-1-ol-3,7,11-trimethyl(Z)
					(II); and 1,2-benzene-dicarboxylic acid butyl(2-ethylpropyl) ester					 (III).Odour preference tests demonstrated that the first compound attracted conspecifics of the opposite sex. By contrast, the second and third compounds were found to attract both sexes. The results conclude that the clitoral gland of laboratory rat contains three major chemical compounds which have a unique function in maintaining social and reproductive status.</p>

				<title>Ovarian steroid sulphate functions as priming pheromone in male <i>Barilius bendelisis</i> (Ham.)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0253-0263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study reveals that pre-ovulatory females of the fish <i>Barilius bendelisis</i> (Ham.) release sex steroids and their conjugates into the water and that a steroid sulphate of these compounds functions as a potent sex pheromone which stimulates milt production in conspecific males prior to spawning. Since males exposed to the purified sub-fraction III of the steroid sulphate fraction have increased milt volume and more spermatozoa with greater motility, the function of this priming pheromone appears to be to enhance male spawning success.</p>
					<p>High turbulence and faster water currents render the hillstream ecosystem extremely challenging for chemical communication. Therefore, ovulatory female fish secrete highly water soluble steroid sulphates for rapid pheromonal action in males. Inhibited milt volume in olfactory tract lesioned (OTL) males exposed to the steroid sulphate fraction and 17𝛼,20𝛽-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one supports the concept that the pheromonally induced priming effect in male fish is mediated through olfactory pathways.</p>

				<title>Determination of age, longevity and age at reproduction of the frog <i>Microhyla ornata</i> by skeletochronology</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0265-0270</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Skeletochronological estimation of age, longevity, age at sexual maturity and breeding of <i>Microhyla ornata</i> was done. Frogs (𝑛 = 62) were collected locally in August (rainy season) 1997 and brought to the laboratory. Body mass and snout-vent-length (SVL) of each frog was recorded; the 4th toe of both the hind limbs was clipped under anaesthesia, fixed in 10% formalin, demineralized in 5% nitric acid and processed for histology. Limb bones (femur, humerus, tibiofibula and radioulna) of 6 large sized frogs were also processed for skeletochronology in order to study the rate of resorption. Gonads of 25 frogs (belonging to different body size ranges) were processed for histology in order to ascertain the gametogenic status of individual frogs. One to four growth rings consisting of growth zones and lines of arrested growth (LAGs) were noticed in frogs of different body sizes; the number of LAGs remained identical in all the limb bones and phalanges in 5 out of 6 frogs. Back calculation indicated that the resorption rate is very low in this frog. Male frogs possessed sperm bundles in seminiferous tubules in the 1st year, while females showed yolky follicles in the ovary in the 2nd year. Frogs found in amplexus were 3–5 years old. The results suggest that this frog may live for a maximum of 5 years in the natural population.</p>

				<title>Topoisomerase II poisoning by indazole and imidazole complexes of ruthenium</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0271-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trans-imidazolium (bis imidazole) tetrachloro ruthenate (RuIm) and trans-indazolium (bis indazole) tetrachloro ruthenate (RuInd) are ruthenium coordination complexes, which were first synthesized and exploited for their anticancer activity. These molecules constitute two of the few most effective anticancer ruthenium compounds. The clinical use of these compounds however was hindered due to toxic side effects on the human body. Our present study on topoisomerase II poisoning by these compounds shows that they effectively poison the activity of topoisomerase II by forming a ternary cleavage complex of DNA, drug and topoisomerase II. The thymidine incorporation assays show that the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation correlates with topoisomerase II poisoning. The present study on topoisomerase II poisoning by these two compounds opens a new avenue for renewing further research on these compounds. This is because they could be effective lead candidates for the development of more potent and less toxic ruthenium containing topoisomerase II poisons. Specificity of action on this molecular target may reduce the toxic effects of these ruthenium-containing molecules and thus improve their therapeutic index.</p>

				<title>Application of InterPro for the functional classification of the proteins of fish origin in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0277-0284</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) is an integrated documentation resource for protein families, domains and sites, developed initially as a means of rationalizing the complementary efforts of the PROSITE, PRINTS, Pfam and ProDom database projects. It is a useful resource that aids the functional classification of proteins. Almost 90% of the <i>actinopterygii</i> protein sequences from SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL can be classified using InterPro. Over 30% of the <i>actinopterygii</i> protein sequences currently in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL are of mitochondrial origin, the majority of which belong to the cytochrome b/b6 family. InterPro also gives insights into the domain composition of the classified proteins and has applications in the functional classification of newly determined sequences lacking biochemical characterization, and in comparative genome analysis. A comparison of the <i>actinopterygii</i> protein sequences against the sequences of other eukaryotes confirms the high representation of eukaryotic protein kinase in the organisms studied. The comparisons also show that, based on InterPro families, the <i>trans</i>-species evolution of MHC class I and II molecules in mammals and teleost fish can be recognized.</p>

					<p>A tissue-specific cDNA library was constructed using polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA from pituitary glands of the Indian catfish <i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i> (Bloch) and a cDNA clone encoding growth hormone (GH) was isolated. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers representing the conserved regions of fish GH sequences the 3&#8242; region of catfish GH cDNA (540 bp) was cloned by random amplification of cDNA ends and the clone was used as a probe to isolate recombinant phages carrying the full-length cDNA sequence. The full-length cDNA clone is 1132 bp in length, coding for an open reading frame (ORF) of 603 bp; the reading frame encodes a putative polypeptide of 200 amino acids including the signal sequence of 22 amino acids. The 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; untranslated regions of the cDNA are 58 bp and 456 bp long, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of <i>H. fossils</i> GH shared 98% homology with other catfishes. Mature GH protein was efficiently expressed in bacterial and zebrafish systems using appropriate expression vectors. The successful expression of the cloned GH cDNA of catfish confirms the functional viability of the clone.</p>

				<title>Evidence for clustered mannose as a new ligand for hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP1) from human fibroblasts</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0325-0332</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have earlier reported that overexpression of the gene encoding human hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP1) is functionally active, as it binds specifically with hyaluronan (HA). In this communication, we confirm the collapse of the filamentous and branched structure of HA by interaction with increasing concentrations of recombinant-HABP1 (rHABP1). HA is the reported ligand of rHABP1. Here, we show the affinity of rHABP1 towards D-mannosylated albumin (DMA) by overlay assay and purification using a DMA affinity column. Our data suggests that DMA is another ligand for HABP1. Furthermore, we have observed that DMA inhibits the binding of HA in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting its multiligand affinity amongst carbohydrates. rHABP1 shows differential affinity towards HA and DMA which depends on pH and ionic strength. These data suggest that affinity of rHABP1 towards different ligands is regulated by the microenvironment.</p>

				<title>Specificity of drug transport mediated by <i>CaMDR1</i>: a major facilitator of <i>Candida albicans</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0333-0339</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>CaMDR1</i> encodes a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) protein in <i>Candida albicans</i> whose expression has been linked to azole resistance and which is frequently encountered in this human pathogenic yeast. In this report we have overexpressed CaMdr1p in <i>Sf9</i> insect cells and demonstrated for the first time that it can mediate methotrexate (MTX) and fluconazole (FLC) transport. MTX appeared to be a better substrate for CaMdr1p among these two tested drugs. Due to severe toxicity of these drugs to insect cells, further characterization of CaMdr1p as a drug transporter could not be done with this system. Therefore, as an alternative, CaMdr1p and Cdr1p, which is an ABC protein (ATP binding cassette) also involved in azole resistance in <i>C. albicans</i>, were independently expressed in a common hypersensitive host JG436 of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. This allowed a better comparison between the functionality of the two export pumps. We observed that while both FLC and MTX are effluxed by CaMdr1p, MTX appeared to be a poor substrate for Cdr1p. JG436 cells expressing Cdr1p thus conferred resistance to other antifungal drugs but remained hypersensitive to MTX. Since MTX is preferentially transported by CaMdr1p, it can be used for studying the function of this MFS protein.</p>

				<title>Insulin alone can lead to a withdrawal of meiotic arrest in the carp oocyte</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0341-0347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Meiotic arrest of oocyte in an Indian carp, <i>Labeo rohita</i> Ham. has been found for the first time to be withdrawn by insulin only. Addition of insulin to oocytes <i>in vitro</i> caused germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), one of the first visual markers to determine initiation of the final maturational process. Under the influence of insulin the germinal vesicle (GV) of the oocyte migrated towards the animal pole, reached the micropyle and then dissolved (GVBD). By using different concentrations of insulin i.e., 0.063, 0.63, 6.3 and 12.6 𝜇M, optimum amount required was found to be 6.3 𝜇M. Induction of GVBD by insulin could be blocked by cycloheximide (Chx), a translation inhibitor, while actinomycin D (AcD) had no effect suggesting non-involvement of transcriptional activity in this process. Addition of the maturation-inducing steroid 17𝛼,20𝛽-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) stimulated (𝑃  &#60; 0.01) GVBD of carp oocytes and its combination with insulin showed an additive effect. Gonadotropin (GtH) caused GVBD but its effect was greatly augmented by insulin. Our results demonstrate that not only can insulin alone induce GVBD in carp oocytes, but it also augments the stimulatory effect of DHP or IGF-I or GtH on GVBD. This information will be important in hormonal manipulation during induced breeding of carp.</p>

				<title>Pancreatic islet-cell viability, functionality and oxidative status remain unaffected at pharmacological concentrations of commonly used antibiotics in <i>vitro</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0349-0355</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, drugs, pollution and life style play an important role in the progression and/or precipitation of diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disorders. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics to combat infectious diseases is one of the commonest forms of misuse of drugs. Antibiotics seem to have a correlation with diabetes and pancreatic function. There are controversial reports about the effect of antibiotics on the pancreatic islets; some suggesting their harmless action, some depicting a beneficial role and others indicating deleterious effect. Moreover, use of antibiotics is mandatory during islet isolation and cultivation to reduce incidences of microbial contamination. It is likely that antibiotic treatment may adversely affect islet viability and its functioning leading to failure of islet transplantation. The present <i>in vitro</i> study was undertaken to examine the effect of commonly used antibiotics such as gentamycin, penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, neomycin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol on islet viability, its functioning and induction of oxidative stress if any. The viability and insulin production data showed that none of the antibiotics used in the present study affect the viability and the functioning of the islets at their pharmacological concentrations. Free radical levels measured in terms of melonyldialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and reduced glutathione (GSH) reveal that except for a marginal increase in lipid peroxidation with tetracycline and slight increase in NO levels with streptomycin, none of these antibiotics affect the oxidative status of the cells. Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase remain unaffected after this treatment. Our results reveal the innocuous nature of the antibiotics used at pharmacological concentrations, suggesting their safety whenever prescribed to combat infections and also during islet isolation procedures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Calcium is among the most commonly used ions, in a multitude of biological functions, so much so that it is impossible to imagine life without calcium. In this article I have attempted to address the question as to how calcium has achieved this status with a brief mention of the history of calcium research in biology. It appears that during the origin and early evolution of life the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion was given a unique opportunity to be used in several biological processes because of its unusual physical and chemical properties.</p>

				<title>Incipient sexual isolation in the <i>nasuta-albomicans</i> complex of <i>Drosophila</i>: mating preference in male-, female– and multiple-choice mating experiments</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0365-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interracial divergence is an important facet of speciation. The <i>nasuta-albomicans</i> complex of <i>Drosophila</i> with sixteen morphologically identical, karyotypically different but cross-fertile races is an excellent system to study a few dimensions of raciation. <i>Drosophila nasuta nasuta, Drosophila nasuta albomicans</i>, Cytorace 1, Cytorace 2, Cytorace 3 and Cytorace 4 of this subgroup have been subjected to male-, female- and multiple-choice mating experiments. Out of 8456 crosses conducted, 7185 had successful matings. The overall impression is that mating is far from random amongst these six closely related races of the <i>nasuta-albomicans</i> complex. The males of <i>D. n. albomicans</i>, Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 4 in male-choice, the females of Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 2 in female-choice, and the males and females of <i>D. n. nasuta, D. n. albomicans</i>, Cytorace 1 and Cytorace 4 against the males and females of Cytorace 2 in multiple-choice experiments, had significantly more homogamic matings than expected. Thus in this study of evolutionary experimentation on raciation under laboratory conditions, we have documented the initiation of preference for con-specific matings among closely related and independently evolving members of the <i>nasuta-albomicans</i> complex of <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>

				<title>Effects of water level changes and wading bird abundance on the foraging behaviour of blacknecked storks <i>Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus</i> in Dudwa National Park, India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0373-0382</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of water level changes and wading birds’ abundance on the foraging behaviour of the blacknecked stork (BNS) <i>Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus</i> was studied from January 1995 to June 1997 in Dudwa National Park, Uttar Pradesh. Our observations indicate that BNS territoriality increased as food levels became depleted, resulting in increased rates of aggression towards intruders. Chasing or aggression was more intense during the early period (February and March) than the late period (April, May and June). Most of (&#62; 50%) the aggressive encounters were observed between 0600 and 1000 h of the day. Seventeen species (including BNS) were observed interacting with BNS, throughout the study period. Most interactions were with the spoonbill, <i>Platalea leucorodia</i> (67.4%), followed by the whitenecked stork, <i>Ciconia episcopus</i> (16.6%). The distance (while foraging) between BNS and other wading birds varied significantly (𝑃  &#60; 0.001) between years indicating that BNS and other water birds foraged at different water depths and thereby explored the wetlands fully. Spoonbills were chased often; the number varied from 1 to 43 birds. BNS occasionally accepted the presence of other wading birds, including spoonbills and started foraging amidst them. This led to successful foraging of BNS (solitary feeder). Other fish-eating bird species and their numbers also limited the food consumption of foraging BNS as they had to spend time chasing away the intruders. Availability of the preferred prey fish species, <i>Heteropnestus fossilis</i>, forced BNS to stay throughout the year in their respective territories. High (&#62; 60 cm) water levels were not suitable for BNS even though the patch had high prey abundance.</p>

				<page>0383-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The war against diabetes through the development of new drugs is an ongoing continuous process to counter the alarming global increase in the prevalence of diabetes and its complications, particularly in developing countries like India. Unfortunately, the speed with which our knowledge of diabetes and its effects is expanding is not matched by the availability of new drugs. Following the identification of the insulin receptor (IR), its intrinsic kinase activity and molecular cloning, many studies have looked at IR as an ideal drug target. This review summarizes in brief the latest advancements in this field with particular reference to the current situation in respect of the development of orally active insulin mimetics in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>

				<title>Current status of fertility control methods in India</title>

				<page>0391-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Approximately 48.2% of couples of 15 to 49 years of age practice family planning methods in India. Female sterilization accounts for 34.2%, with male sterilization declining from 3.4% in 1992–93 to 1.9% in 1998–99. Use of the condom increased to 3.1% from 2.4%. There is an urgent need for research to develop new contraceptive modalities especially for men and also for women and to make existing methods more safe, affordable and acceptable. Current efforts in India to develop a male contraceptive are mainly directed towards</p>
					<ol>
						<li>development of antispermatogenic agents to suppress sperm production,</li>
						<li>prevention of sperm maturation,</li>
						<li>prevention of sperm transport through vas deferens or rendering these sperm infertile and</li>
						<li>prevention of sperm deposition.</li>
					</ol> 
					<p>Research work in the field of prevention of sperm transport through vas deferens has made significant advances. Styrene maleic anhydride (SMA) disturbed the electrical charge of spermatozoa leading to acrosome rupture and consequent loss in fertilizing ability of sperm. A multicentre phase-III clinical trial using SMA is continuing and it is hoped that the SMA approach would be available in the near future as an indigenously developed injectable intra-vasal male contraceptive.</p>
					<p>The safety and efficacy of available oral contraceptives were evaluated. An indigenously developed oral contraceptive `Centchorman’, which is a nonsteroidal, weakly estrogenic but potently antiestrogenic, was found to be safe and effective and is now being marketed in India since 1991 as a `once a week’ pill. Cyclofem and Mesigyna have been recommended as injectable contraceptives with proper counselling and service delivery by Indian studies. It has been recommended that these injectable contraceptives be added to the existing range of contraceptive methods available in the National Family Planning Programme. Based on the Indian studies CuT 200 was also recommended. Studies have indicated the advantage of intrauterine devices (IUD); they are long acting, relatively easily removed and fertility returns rapidly after their removal. Recent studies have recommended CuT 200 for use up to 5 years. The combination of some plant products i.e. <i>Embelia ribes</i>, Borax and <i>Piper longum</i> has been found to be safe and effective as a female contraceptive and the results of phase-I clinical trials are encouraging.</p>
					<p>Research work is going on in the country in various areas with special reference to hormonal contraceptive – a three monthly injectable contraceptive, immuno-contraceptives, antiprogestins, etc.</p>

					<p>The next generation of contraceptives will be based on the identification of novel molecules essential for reproductive processes and will rely on the refinement of older as well as newer technologies. Functional analysis of naturally occurring reproductive genetic disorders and creation of mice null for specific genes would greatly assist in the choice of genetic targets for contraceptive development. Structure-based design of drugs as exemplified by the preparation of an orally active non-peptide gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) would revolutionize drug formulation and delivery for a peptide analogue. This review examines some of the molecular targets that may change contraceptive choices in the future.</p>

				<title>Molecular insights into the causes of male infertility</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0429-0435</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Infertility is a reproductive health problem that affects many couples in the human population. About 13–18% of couple suffers from it and approximately one-half of all cases can be traced to either partner. Regardless of whether it is primary or secondary infertility, affected couples suffer from enormous emotional and psychological trauma and it can constitute a major life crisis in the social context. Many cases of idiopathic infertility have a genetic or molecular basis. The knowledge of the molecular genetics of male infertility is developing rapidly, new ``spermatogenic genes” are being discovered and molecular diagnostic approaches (DNA chips) established. This will immensely help diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to alleviate human infertility. The present review provides an overview of the causes of human infertility, particularly the molecular basis of male infertility and its implications for clinical practice.</p>

				<page>0437-0464</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Knowledge and understanding of the epidemiological profile is an essential pre-requisite to assess and address public health needs in the country and to enable efficient programme planning and management. The need for adequate and accurate health information and data to undertake such an exercise cannot be over-emphasized. The present effort is a modest attempt to critically analyse the epidemiological profile of India from the historical and contemporary perspective. In order to assess the successes achieved as well caution against the daunting challenges awaiting the country, parameters such as disease burden and health status indicators, are increasingly being used. Changes in the population age structure, improvements in the nation’s economic status, altered lifestyles of people and duality of disease burden testify to the demographic, development and health transition occurring in the country. Population stabilization, poverty alleviation, life-style modification, surveillance and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases constitute the major challenges demanding urgent attention in the future.</p>

				<title>Increasing population and declining biological resources in the context of global change and globalization</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0465-0479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the context of over-consumption of natural resources in the name of development and rapid industrialization by a small section of the human population that is rapidly growing, the world is currently faced with a variety of environmental uncertainties. `Global change’ covering a whole variety of ecological issues, and `globalization’ in an economic sense, are two major phenomena that are responsible for these uncertainties. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the developing countries more than the developed, particularly the marginalized traditional (those living close to nature and natural resources) societies would be the worst sufferers. In order to cope with this problem in a situation where the traditional societies have to cope with rapidly depleting biodiversity on which they are dependant for their livelihood, there is an urgent need to explore additional pathways for sustainable management of natural resources and societal development. Such pathways should be based on a landscape management strategy, that takes into consideration the rich traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) that these societies have. This is critical because TEK is the connecting link between conservation and sustainable development. This paper explores the possibilities in this direction through a balanced approach to development, that links the `traditional’ with the `modern’, in a location-specific way.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>High prevalence of low birth weight, high morbidity and mortality in children and poor maternal nutrition of the mother continue to be major nutritional concerns in India. Although nationwide intervention programmes are in operation over two decades, the situation has not changed greatly. In addition, the Indian population is passing through a nutritional transition and is expected to witness higher prevalences of adult non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease according to the theory of `fetal origin of adult disease’. Clearly, there is a need for examining several issues of nutritional significance for effective planning of interventions. In particular, maternal nutrition and fetal growth relationship, long term effects of early life undernutrition, interactions of prenatal nutritional experiences and postnatal undernutrition are some of the major issues that have been discussed in the present paper with the help of prospective data from various community nutrition studies carried out in the department.</p>

				<title>Prehistoric human colonization of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0491-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human colonization in India encompasses a span of at least half-a-million years and is divided into two broad periods, namely the prehistoric (before the emergence of writing) and the historic (after writing). The prehistoric period is divided into stone, bronze and iron ages. The stone age is further divided into palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic periods. As the name suggests, the technology in these periods was primarily based on stone. Economically, the palaeolithic and mesolithic periods represented a nomadic, hunting-gathering way of life, while the neolithic period represented a settled, food-producing way of life. Subsequently copper was introduced as a new material and this period was designated as the chalcolithic period. The invention of agriculture, which took place about 8000 years ago, brought about dramatic changes in the economy, technology and demography of human societies. Human habitat in the hunting-gathering stage was essentially on hilly, rocky and forested regions, which had ample wild plant and animal food resources. The introduction of agriculture saw it shifting to the alluvial plains which had fertile soil and perennial availability of water. Hills and forests, which had so far been areas of attraction, now turned into areas of isolation.</p>
					<p>Agriculture led to the emergence of villages and towns and brought with it the division of society into occupational groups. The first urbanization took place during the bronze age in the arid and semi-arid region of northwest India in the valleys of the Indus and the Saraswati rivers, the latter represented by the now dry Ghaggar–Hakra bed. This urbanization is known as the Indus or Harappan civilization which flourished during 3500–1500 B.C. The rest of India during this period was inhabited by neolithic and chalcolithic farmers and mesolithic hunter-gatherers.</p>
					<p>With the introduction of iron technology about 3000 years ago, the focus of development shifted eastward into the Indo-Gangetic divide and the Ganga valley. The location of the <i>Mahabharata</i> epic, which is set in the beginning of the first millennium B.C., is the Indo-Gangetic divide and the upper Ganga-Yamuna doab (land between two rivers). Iron technology enabled pioneering farmers to clear the dense and tangled forests of the middle and lower Ganga plains. The focus of development now shifted further eastward to eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar which witnessed the events of the <i>Ramayana</i> epic and rise of the first political entities known as <i>Mahajanapadas</i> as also of Buddhism and Jainism. The second phase of urbanization of India, marked by trade, coinage, script and birth of the first Indian empire, namely Magadha, with its capital at Pataliputra (modern Patna) also took place in this region in the sixth century B.C. The imposition by Brahmin priests of the concepts of racial and ritual purity, pollution, restrictions on sharing of food, endogamy, <i>anuloma</i> (male of upper caste eligible to marry a female of lower caste) and <i>pratiloma</i> (female of upper caste ineligible to marry a male of lower caste) forms of marriage, <i>karma</i> (reaping the fruits of the actions of previous life in the present life), rebirth, <i>varnashrama dharma</i> (four stages of the expected hundred-year life span) and the sixteen <i>sanskaras</i> (ceremonies) on traditional occupational groups led to the birth of the caste system – a unique Indian phenomenon.</p>
					<p>As a consequence of the expansion of agriculture and loss of forests and wildlife, stone age hunter-gatherers were forced to assimilate themselves into larger agriculture-based rural and urban societies. However, some of them resisted this new economic mode. To this day they have persisted with their atavistic lifestyle, but have had to supplement their resources by producing craft items or providing entertainment to the rural population.</p>

					<p>It is now widely accepted that</p>

						<li>migrated out of Africa and replaced archaic humans in other parts of the world, and</li>

					<p>India, therefore, served as a major corridor for dispersal of modern humans. By studying variation at DNA level in contemporary human populations of India, we have provided evidence that mitochondrial DNA haplotypes based on RFLPs are strikingly similar across ethnic groups of India, consistent with the hypothesis that a small number of females entered India during the initial process of the peopling of India. We have also provided evidence that there may have been dispersal of humans from India to southeast Asia. In conjunction with haplotype data, nucleotide sequence data of a hypervariable segment (HVS-1) of the mitochondrial genome indicate that the ancestors of the present austro-asiatic tribal populations may have been the most ancient inhabitants of India. Based on Y-chromosomal RFLP and STRP data, we have also been able to trace footprints of human movements from west and central Asia into India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of vitamin A has been studied on lens regeneration in young (7 days old) as well as adult mice. A longitudinal slit was made under local anesthesia in the cornea over the lens. The lens was extracted intact through the incision. Intraperitonial injection of vitamin A (0.05 ml of 30 IU/ml in young and 0.05 ml of 50 IU/ml in adult) was given to the operated animals. Vitamin A was found to induce lens regeneration in not only young but also in adult mice. Regenerated lenses were similar in shape, size, transparency and histological features to normal intact lenses.</p>

				<title>Local repeat sequence organization of an intergenic spacer in the chloroplast genome of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> leads to DNA expansion and sequence scrambling: a complex mode of “copy-choice replication”?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0583-0594</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Parent-specific, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were obtained from total genomic DNA of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Such parent-specific RAPD bands (genomic fingerprints) segregated uniparentally (through mt<sup>+</sup>) in a cross between a pair of polymorphic interfertile strains of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>C. reinhardtii</i> and <i>C. minnesotti</i>), suggesting that they originated from the chloroplast genome. Southern analysis mapped the RAPD-markers to the chloroplast genome. One of the RAPD-markers, ``P2” (1.6 kb) was cloned, sequenced and was fine mapped to the 3 kb region encompassing 3&#8242; end of 23S, full 5S and intergenic region between 5S and psbA. This region seems divergent enough between the two parents, such that a specific PCR designed for a parental specific chloroplast sequence within this region, amplified a marker in that parent only and not in the other, indicating the utility of RAPD-scan for locating the genomic regions of sequence divergence. Remarkably, the RAPD-product, ``P2” seems to have originated from a PCR-amplification of a much smaller (about 600 bp), but highly repeat-rich (direct and inverted) domain of the 3 kb region in a manner that yielded no linear sequence alignment with its own template sequence. The amplification yielded the same uniquely ``sequence-scrambled” product, whether the template used for PCR was total cellular DNA, chloroplast DNA or a plasmid clone DNA corresponding to that region. The PCR product, a ``unique” new sequence, had lost the repetitive organization of the template genome where it had originated from and perhaps represented a ``complex path” of copy-choice replication.</p>

				<title>MutS recognition: Multiple mismatches and sequence context effects</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0595-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Escherichia coli</i> MutS is a versatile repair protein that specifically recognizes not only various types of mismatches but also single stranded loops of up to 4 nucleotides in length. Specific binding, followed by the next step of tracking the DNA helix that locates hemi-methylated sites, is regulated by the conformational state of the protein as a function of ATP binding/hydrolysis. Here, we study how various molecular determinants of a heteroduplex regulate mismatch recognition by MutS, the critical first step of mismatch repair. Using classical DNase I footprinting assays, we demonstrate that the hierarchy of MutS binding to various types of mismatches is identical whether the mismatches are present singly or in multiples. Moreover, this unique hierarchy is indifferent both to the differential level of DNA helical flexibility and to the unpaired status of the mismatched bases in a heteroduplex. Surprisingly, multiple mismatches exhibit reduced affinity of binding to MutS, compared to that of a similar single mismatch. Such a reduction in the affinity might be due to sequence context effects, which we established more directly by studying two identical single mismatches in an altered sequence background. A mismatch, upon simply being flipped at the same location, elicits changes in MutS specific contacts, thereby underscoring the importance of sequence context in modulating MutS binding to mismatches.</p>

				<title>Role of <i>LLD</i>, a new locus for leaflet/pinna morphogenesis in <i>Pisum sativum</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0607-0625</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Properties of a mutant at the <i>LLD</i> (<i>LEAF-LET DEVELOPMENT</i>) locus in pea <i>Pisum sativum</i> L. are reported in this paper. Plants homozygous for the Mendelian recessive mutation <i>lld</i> bear leaves in which a few to many leaflets are incompletely developed. Opposite pinnae of rachis nodes often formed fused incompletely developed leaflets. The <i>lld</i> mutation was observed to abort pinna development at almost all morphogenetic stages. The <i>lld</i> mutation demonstrated high penetrance and low expressivity. The phenotypes of <i>lld</i> plants in <i>tl, tac, tl tac, tl af</i> and <i>tl af tac</i> backgrounds suggested that LLD function is involved in the separation of lateral adjacent blastozones differentiated on primary, secondary and tertiary rachides and lamina development in leaflets. The aborted development of tendrils and leaflets in <i>lld</i> mutants was related to deficiency in vascular tissue growth. The morphological and anatomical features of the leaflets formed on a <i>tl lld</i> double mutant permitted a model of basipetal leaflet development. The key steps of leaflet morphogenesis include origin of the lamina by splitting of a radially symmetrical growing pinna having abaxial outer surface, opposite to the vascular cylinder, through an invaginational groove, differentiation of adaxial surface along the outer boundary of split tissue in the groove and expansion of the lamina ridges so formed into lamina spans.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study was carried out qualitatively and quantitatively to investigate the presence and the concentrations of anabolic steroids in urine collected from orally administered humans. Microanalysis of conjugated steroids by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been carried out. Following oral administration three major metabolites of anabolic steroid drugs have been detected and partially characterized. The six steroids can be analysed at the same time in 17 min. The lower detection limit was 10 ng/ml in 5 ml of urine. The conjugated steroids from urine were centrifuged to 2,430 𝑔 for 10 min, the supernatant solution passed through Amberlite XAD-2 column and the steroids eluted fraction esterified by using MSTFA and TMSI. The rate of metabolism and urinary excretion seem to be reasonably fast.</p>

				<title>Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction analysis of two different populations of cultured Korean catfish <i>Silurus asotus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0641-0647</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic similarity and diversity of cultured catfish <i>Silurus asotus</i> populations collected from two areas in western Korea were examined using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Out of 20 random primers tested, 5 produced 1344 RAPD bands ranging from 8.2 to 13.6 polymorphic bands per primer. The polymorphic bands in these populations ranged from 56.4% to 59.6%. Polymorphic bands per lane within populations ranged from 4.9% to 5.3%. The similarity within the Kunsan population varied from 0.39 to 0.82 with a mean (&#177; SD) of 0.56 &#177; 0.08. The level of bandsharing values was 0.59 &#177; 0.07 within the catfish population from Yesan. The genetic similarity in cultured catfish populations may have been caused because individuals from two populations were reared in the same environmental conditions or by inbreeding during several generations. However, in view of bandsharing values, polymorphic bands and also the specific major bands that were inter-population-specific, significant genetic differentiation between these populations were present even if bandsharing (BS) values were somewhat numerically different. Therefore, the number of RAPD polymorphisms identified in this study may be sufficient to permit estimating genetic similarity and diversity. However, in future, additional populations, sampling sites and individuals will be necessary to make up for these weak points.</p>

				<page>0649-0665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Model building and molecular mechanics studies have been carried out to examine the potential structures for d(GGC/GCC)<sub>5</sub> and d(CAG/CTG)<sub>5</sub> that might relate to their biological function and association with triplet repeat expansion diseases. Model building studies suggested that hairpin and quadruplex structures could be formed with these repeat sequences. Molecular mechanics studies have demonstrated that the hairpin and hairpin dimer structures of triplet repeat sequences formed by looping out of the two strands are as favourable as the corresponding B-DNA type hetero duplex structures. Further, at high salt condition, Greek key type quadruplex structures are energetically comparable with hairpin dimer and B-DNA type duplex structures. All tetrads in the quadruplex structures are well stacked and provide favourable stacking energy values. Interestingly, in the energy minimized hairpin dimer and Greek key type quadruplex structures, all the bases even in the non-G tetrads are cyclically hydrogen bonded, even though the A, C and T-tetrads were not hydrogen bonded in the starting structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article is focused on the problems of reduction of the risk associated with the deliberate release of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) into the environment. Special attention is given to overview the most probable physiological and genetic processes which could be induced in the released GMMs by adverse environmental conditions, namely:</p>

						<li>activation of quorum sensing and the functions associated with it,</li>
						<li>entering into a state of general resistance,</li>
						<li>activation of adaptive mutagenesis, adaptive amplifications and transpositions and</li>
						<li>stimulation of inter-species gene transfer.</li>
					 </ol>
					 <p>To reduce the risks associated with GMMs, the inactivation of their key genes responsible for stress-stimulated increase of viability and evolvability is proposed.</p>

				<title>SWORDS: A statistical tool for analysing large DNA sequences</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0006</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, we present some simple yet effective statistical techniques for analysing and comparing large DNA sequences. These techniques are based on frequency distributions of DNA words in a large sequence, and have been packaged into a software called SWORDS. Using sequences available in public domain databases housed in the Internet, we demonstrate how SWORDS can be conveniently used by molecular biologists and geneticists to unmask biologically important features hidden in large sequences and assess their statistical significance.</p>

				<title>Ab <i>initio</i> gene identification: prokaryote genome annotation with GeneScan and GLIMMER</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0007-0014</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compare the annotation of three complete genomes using the <i>ab initio</i> methods of gene identification GeneScan and GLIMMER. The annotation given in GenBank, the standard against which these are compared, has been made using GeneMark. We find a number of novel genes which are predicted by both methods used here, as well as a number of genes that are predicted by GeneMark, but are not identified by either of the nonconsensus methods that we have used. The three organisms studied here are all prokaryotic species with fairly compact genomes. The Fourier measure forms the basis for an efficient non-consensus method for gene prediction, and the algorithm GeneScan exploits this measure. We have bench-marked this program as well as GLIMMER using 3 complete prokaryotic genomes. An effort has also been made to study the limitations of these techniques for complete genome analysis. GeneScan and GLIMMER are of comparable accuracy insofar as gene-identification is concerned, with sensitivities and specificities typically greater than 0.9. The number of false predictions (both positive and negative) is higher for GeneScan as compared to GLIMMER, but in a significant number of cases, similar results are provided by the two techniques. This suggests that there could be some as-yet unidentified additional genes in these three genomes, and also that some of the putative identifications made hitherto might require re-evaluation. All these cases are discussed in detail.</p>

				<title>Comparative genomics using data mining tools</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0015-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have analysed the genomes of representatives of three kingdoms of life, namely, archaea, eubacteria and eukaryota using data mining tools based on compositional analyses of the protein sequences. The representatives chosen in this analysis were <i>Methanococcus jannaschii, Haemophilus influenzae</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We have identified the common and different features between the three genomes in the protein evolution patterns. <i>M. jannaschii</i> has been seen to have a greater number of proteins with more charged amino acids whereas <i>S. cerevisiae</i> has been observed to have a greater number of hydrophilic proteins. Despite the differences in intrinsic compositional characteristics between the proteins from the different genomes we have also identified certain common characteristics. We have carried out exploratory Principal Component Analysis of the multivariate data on the proteins of each organism in an effort to classify the proteins into clusters. Interestingly, we found that most of the proteins in each organism cluster closely together, but there are a few ‘outliers’. We focus on the outliers for the functional investigations, which may aid in revealing any unique features of the biology of the respective organisms.</p>

				<page>0027-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bacterial genomes are extremely dynamic and mosaic in nature. A substantial amount of genetic information is inserted into or deleted from such genomes through the process of horizontal transfer. Through the introduction of novel physiological traits from distantly related organisms, horizontal gene transfer often causes drastic changes in the ecological and pathogenic character of bacterial species and thereby promotes microbial diversification and speciation. This review discusses how the recent influx of complete chromosomal sequences of various microorganisms has allowed for a quantitative assessment of the scope, rate and impact of horizontally transmitted information on microbial evolution.</p>

				<title>Molecular genetics of schizophrenia: past, present and future</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0035-0052</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with a polygenic mode of inheritance which is also governed by non-genetic factors. Candidate genes identified on the basis of biochemical and pharmacological evidence are being tested for linkage and association studies. Neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and serotonin have been widely implicated in its etiology. Genome scan of all human chromosomes with closely spaced polymorphic markers is being used for linkage studies. The completion and availability of the first draft of Human Genome Sequence has provided a treasure-trove that can be utilized to gain insight into the so far inaccessible regions of the human genome. Significant technological advances for identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and use of microarrays have further strengthened research methodologies for genetic analysis of complex traits. In this review, we summarize the evolution of schizophrenia genetics from the past to the present, current trends and future direction of research.</p>

				<title>Triplet repeat DNA structures and human genetic disease: dynamic mutations from dynamic DNA</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0053-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fourteen genetic neurodegenerative diseases and three fragile sites have been associated with the expansion of (CTG)<sub>n</sub>&#8226;(CAG)<sub>n</sub>, (CGG)<sub>n</sub>&#8226;(CCG)<sub>n</sub>, or (GAA)<sub>n</sub>&#8226;(TTC)<sub>n</sub> repeat tracts. Different models have been proposed for the expansion of triplet repeats, most of which presume the formation of alternative DNA structures in repeat tracts. One of the most likely structures, slipped strand DNA, may stably and reproducibly form within triplet repeat sequences. The propensity to form slipped strand DNA is proportional to the length and homogeneity of the repeat tract. The remarkable stability of slipped strand DNA may, in part, be due to loop-loop interactions facilitated by the sequence complementarity of the loops and the dynamic structure of three-way junctions formed at the loop-outs.</p>

				<title>Variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism in Indian populations of different ethnic origins</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0067-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the Indian population is poorly known. In order to determine the status of the polymorphism, young unrelated male army recruits were screened. The population had cultural and linguistic differences and lived in an environment that varied significantly from one region to another. Analysis of the genotype, showed higher frequency of the insertion allele in four of the five groups i.e. I allele frequency was significantly higher (𝑃  &#60; 0.05) in Dogras, Assamese and Kumaonese. The deletion allele frequency was comparatively higher in the fifth group that belonged to Punjab. A correlation was observed between the genotype and enzyme activity. Involvement of a single D allele in the genotype enhanced the activity up to 37.56 &#177; 3.13%. The results suggested ethnic heterogeneity with a significant gene cline with higher insertion allele frequency. Such population-based data on various polymorphisms can ultimately be exploited in pharmacogenomics.</p>

				<title>Genes encoding chimeras of <i>Neurospora crassa erg-3</i> and human TM7SF2 proteins fail to complement Neurospora and yeast sterol C-14 reductase mutants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0105-0112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The human gene TM7SF2 encodes a polypeptide (SR-1) with high sequence similarity to sterol C-14 reductase, a key sterol biosynthetic enzyme in fungi, plants and mammals. In Neurospora and yeast this enzyme is encoded by the <i>erg-3</i> and <i>erg24</i> genes respectively. In an effort to demonstrate sterol C-14 reductase activity for SR-1 we constructed six recombinant genes coding for chimeras of the Neurospora <i>erg-3</i> and SR-1 protein sequences and tested them for complementation of the Neurospora <i>erg-3</i> mutant. To our surprise, all the chimeras failed to complement <i>erg-3</i>. A few of the chimeric proteins were also tested against the yeast <i>erg24</i> mutant, but again there was no complementation. We discuss some reasons that might account for these unexpected findings.</p>

					<p>The effect of two insect growth regulators of plant origin viz. plumbagin and azadirachtin and the ecdysteroids 20-hydroxyecdysone, makisterone A and a phytoecdysteroid on DNA synthesis in imaginal wing discs of day 4 final instar <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> larvae was studied. DNA synthesis increased with increase in time of incubation up to 8 h and decreased later without the addition of moulting hormone. Addition of 20-hydroxyecdysone supported long term acquisition of competence for DNA synthesis in the wing discs. Both DNA synthesis and protein content were drastically reduced in plumbagin and azadirachtin-treated insects. Under <i>in vitro</i> conditions, plumbagin had a more pronounced inhibitory effect than azadirachtin. All the ecdysteroids tested, viz. makisterone A, 20-hydroxyecdysone and the ecdysteroidal fraction from the silver fern <i>Cheilanthes farinosa</i> enhanced DNA synthesis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Enthalpy–entropy compensation is the name given to the correlation sometimes observed between the estimates of the enthalpy and entropy of a reaction obtained from temperature-dependence data. Although the mainly artefactual nature of this correlation has been known for many years, the subject enjoys periodical revivals, in part because of the frequent excellence of the correlation. As with other cases of impossibly good correlation between two biological variables, the explanation is that what purports to be two variables are very largely the same variable looked at in two different ways.</p>

				<title>Role of HLA antigens in Rh (D) alloimmunized pregnant women from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0135-0141</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Immunogenetic studies in various diseases provide potential genetic markers. We have studied the incidence of HLA A, B, C, DR and DQ loci antigen in Rh (D) antigen isoimmunized mothers compared to those nonimmunized isoimmunized Rh negative mothers. Seventy six mothers who were immunized to Rh (D) antigen due to pregnancy (responders) and fifty four mothers who did not develop Rh (D) isoimmunization despite positive pregnancies (nonresponders) were selected for the study. Standard methods of serological HLA typing, ABO and Rh (D) groups, and screening for Rh D antibodies were used. 392 unrelated individuals from the population were compared as controls. In addition 45 unrelated individuals from the same population were typed for HLA DRB and DQB gene using PCR-SSP kits. The genotype frequencies of HLA A2, A3, A28, B13, B17, B35, B52, B60, Cw2, Cw6, DR4, and DQ3 were significantly increased, while the frequencies of the HLA A11, A29, A31, B7, B37, B51, Cw1 and DR9 were decreased in the responder women when compared to the non-responder women. HLA A30 (19) split antigen was not identified in immunized women while HLA A23 (9) split antigen was not identified in non immunized women. HLA A3, B17, Cw2 and DR4 showed a significant relative risk among the immunized responder women. When compared with Rh immunized women (responders) reported from USA, England and Hungary the phenotype frequencies of HLA A11, A24, A28, B5, B17, B40, DR2 and DR5 were increased while HLA A23, B8, B18, and DR6 were decreased in the Indian Rh immunized women. Two locus haplotype frequency analysis observed among the responders women revealed that among the significant haplotypes expressed A2–B5, B7–Cw1, DR2–DQ1 were highly significant haplotypes in positive linkage, while A1–B5, and A1–B7 were in significant negative linkage disequilibrium. The haplotype frequencies were &#8804; one when these common hapoltypes were compared with control population. Thus in the present study it is evident that the inheritance of HLA A3, B17, Cw2 and DR4 increases the relative risk factor by 2.6 times among Indian Rh isoimmunized women. Further, it is evident that there are significant differences in the observed HLA antigen frequencies and two locus haplotypes in Rh isoimmunized women when compared to women from USA, UK and Hungary due to extreme HLA polymorphism in different populations of the world.</p>

				<title>Murine model of BCG lung infection: Dynamics of lymphocyte subpopulations in lung interstitium and tracheal lymph nodes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0143-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>C57Bl/6 female mice were infected with an intrapulmonary dose of 2.5 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> BCG (<i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> Bacillus Calmette-Guerin). Lymphocyte populations in lung interstitium and lung-associated tracheal lymph nodes (LN) were examined at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after infection. BCG load in lungs peaked between 4–6 weeks post-infection and declined to very low levels by the 12th week of infection. Lung leukocytes were obtained over the course of infection by enzyme digestion of lung tissue followed by centrifugation over Percoll discontinuous density gradients. By 4 to 6 weeks after infection, numbers of lung leukocytes had more than doubled but the proportions of lymphocytes (about 70%), macrophages (about 18%) and granulocytes (about 12%) remained essentially unaltered. Flow cytometric studies indicated:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the total number of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in lungs increased by 3-fold relative to uninfected controls at 5 to 6 weeks post-infection, but the relative proportions of CD4 and CD8 cells within the T cell compartment remained unaltered;</li>
						<li>relative proportion of NK cells in lungs declined by 30% but the total number of NK cells (NK1.1<sup>+</sup>) per lung increased by about 50%, 5–6 weeks post infection;</li>
						<li>tracheal LN underwent marked increase in size and cell recoveries (6–10-fold increase) beginning 4 weeks after infection.</li>
					 </ol>
					 <p>While both T and B cells contributed to the increase in cell recoveries from infected tracheal LNs, the T/B ratio declined significantly but CD4/CD8 ratio remained unaltered. In control mice, IFN𝛾 producing non-T cells outnumbered T cells producing IFN𝛾. However, as the adaptive response to infection evolves, marked increase occur in the number of IFN𝛾 producing T cells, but not NK cells in the lungs. Thus, T cells are the primary cell type responsible for the adaptive IFN𝛾 response to pulmonary BCG infection. Few T cells in tracheal LN of BCG infected mice produce IFN𝛾, suggesting that maturational changes associated with migration to the lungs or residence in the lungs enhance the capability of some T cells to produce this cytokine.</p>

				<title>Prenatal detection of aneuploidies using fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization: A preliminary experience in an Indian set up</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0155-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) is a powerful molecular cytogenetic technique which allows rapid detection of aneuploidies on interphase cells and metaphase spreads. The aim of the present study was to evaluate FISH as a tool in prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidies in high risk pregnancies in an Indian set up. Prenatal diagnosis was carried out in 88 high-risk pregnancies using FISH and cytogenetic analysis. Multicolour commercially available FISH probes specific for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y were used. Interphase FISH was done on uncultured cells from chorionic villus and amniotic fluid samples. FISH on metaphase spreads was done from cord blood samples. The results of FISH were in conformity with the results of cytogenetic analysis in all the normal and aneuploid cases except in one case of structural chromosomal abnormality. The hybridization efficiency of the 5 probes used for the detection of aneuploidies was 100%. Using these probes FISH assay yielded discrete differences in the signal profiles between cytogenetically normal and abnormal samples. The overall mean interphase disomic signal patterns of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y were 94.45%; for interphase trisomic signal pattern of chromosome 21 was 97.3%. Interphase FISH is very useful in urgent high risk cases. The use of FISH overcomes the difficulties of conventional banding on metaphase spreads and reduces the time of reporting. However, with the limited number of probes used, the conventional cytogenetic analysis serves as a gold standard at present. It should be employed as an adjunctive tool to conventional cytogenetics.</p>

				<title>Origins of gene, genetic code, protein and life: comprehensive view of life systems from a GNC-SNS primitive genetic code hypothesis</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0165-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated the origin of genes, the genetic code, proteins and life using six indices (hydropathy, 𝛼-helix, 𝛽-sheet and 𝛽-turn formabilities, acidic amino acid content and basic amino acid content) necessary for appropriate three-dimensional structure formation of globular proteins. From the analysis of microbial genes, we have concluded that newly-born genes are products of nonstop frames (NSF) on antisense strands of microbial GC-rich genes [GC-NSF(a)] and from SNS repeating sequences [(SNS)<sub>n</sub>] similar to the GC-NSF(a) (S and N mean G or C and either of four bases, respectively). We have also proposed that the universal genetic code used by most organisms on the earth presently could be derived from a GNC-SNS primitive genetic code. We have further presented the [GADV]-protein world hypothesis of the origin of life as well as a hypothesis of protein production, suggesting that proteins were originally produced by random peptide formation of amino acids restricted in specific amino acid compositions termed as GNC-, SNS- and GC-NSF(a)-0th order structures of proteins. The [GADV]-protein world hypothesis is primarily derived from the GNC-primitive genetic code hypothesis. It is also expected that basic properties of extant genes and proteins could be revealed by considerations based on the scenario with four stages.</p>

				<title>Theoretical approaches to holistic biological features: Pattern formation, neural networks and the brain-mind relation</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0195-0205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The topic of this article is the relation between bottom-up and top-down, reductionist and ``holistic” approaches to the solution of basic biological problems. While there is no doubt that the laws of physics apply to all events in space and time, including the domains of life, understanding biology depends not only on elucidating the role of the molecules involved, but, to an increasing extent, on systems theoretical approaches in diverse fields of the life sciences. Examples discussed in this article are the generation of spatial patterns in development by the interplay of autocatalysis and lateral inhibition; the evolution of integrating capabilities of the human brain, such as cognition-based empathy; and both neurobiological and epistemological aspects of scientific theories of consciousness and the mind.</p>

				<title>Carbon – the first frontier of information processing</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0207-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Information is often encoded as an aperiodic chain of building blocks. Modern digital computers use bits as the building blocks, but in general the choice of building blocks depends on the nature of the information to be encoded. What are the optimal building blocks to encode structural information? This can be analysed by substituting the operations of addition and multiplication of conventional arithmetic with translation and rotation. It is argued that at the molecular level, the best component for encoding discretized structural information is carbon. Living organisms discovered this billions of years ago, and used carbon as the back-bone for constructing proteins that function according to their structure. Structural analysis of polypeptide chains shows that an efficient and versatile structural language of 20 building blocks is needed to implement all the tasks carried out by proteins. Properties of amino acids indicate that the present triplet genetic code was preceded by a more primitive one, coding for 10 amino acids using two nucleotide bases.</p>

				<title>An insight into the possible mechanism of working of two-cistronic gene expression systems and rational designing of newer systems</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0219-0231</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The initial attempts at hyper-expressing buffalo/goat growth hormone (GH)-ORFs in <i>Escherichia coli</i> directly under various strong promoters were not successful despite the presence of a functional gene. High level expression of GH was achieved as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). To produce native GH in an unfused state, we adapted an established strategy of two-cistronic approach in our system. In this strategy, utilizing one of the highly efficient reported sequences as the first cistron led to a nearly 1000-fold enhancement in the level of expression under an <i>E. coli</i> promoter (<i>trc</i>). In search of a newer first-cistron sequence as well as to see the generality of the two-cistronic approach, we explored the ability of different lengths of a highly expressing natural gene to act as an efficient first cistron. Surprisingly, <i>GST</i>, which is naturally highly expressible in <i>E. coli</i>, could not be fitted into a successful two-cistronic construct. In addition, placement of the entire two-cistronic expression cassette (which had earlier given high-level GH expression under <i>trc</i> promoter) under the <i>T7</i> promoter in <i>E. coli</i> failed to hyper-express GH. These results suggest that the successful exploitation of the two-cistron arrangement for hyper-expression of eukaryotic ORFs in bacteria is not as straightforward as was previously thought. It appears probable that factors such as the sequence context, together with the length and codons used in the first cistron are important as well.</p>

				<title>Overexpression and characterization of dimeric and tetrameric forms of recombinant serine hydroxymethyltransferase from <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0233-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a pyridoxal-5&#8242;-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of L-Ser and Gly using tetrahydrofolate as a substrate. The gene encoding for SHMT was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of <i>Bacillus stearothermophilus</i> and the PCR product was cloned and overexpressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The purified recombinant enzyme was isolated as a mixture of dimer (90%) and tetramer (10%). This is the first report demonstrating the existence of SHMT as a dimer and tetramer in the same organism. The specific activities at 37&#176;C of the dimeric and tetrameric forms were 6.7 U/mg and 4.1 U/mg, respectively. The purified dimer was extremely thermostable with a 𝑇<sub>m</sub> of 85&#176;C in the presence of PLP and L-Ser. The temperature optimum of the dimer was 80&#176;C with a specific activity of 32.4 U/mg at this temperature. The enzyme catalyzed tetrahydrofolate-independent reactions at a slower rate compared to the tetrahydrofolate-dependent retro-aldol cleavage of L-Ser. The interaction with substrates and their analogues indicated that the orientation of PLP ring of <i>B. stearothermophilus</i> SHMT was probably different from sheep liver cytosolic recombinant SHMT (scSHMT).</p>

				<title>Human placental lipid induces mitogenesis and melanogenesis in B16F10 melanoma cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>A hydroalcoholic extract of fresh term human placenta was found to be mitogenic as well as melanogenic on B16F10 mouse melanoma in an <i>in vitro</i> culture. The extract, a reservoir of a large number of bioactive molecules, was resolved to get the lipid fraction. Its activity was evaluated on B16F10 mouse melanoma by assessing the change in cellular morphology, growth and melanin induction. The lipid fraction, placental total lipid fraction (PTLF) tested in the study employed doses of 0.01 to 200 𝜇g/ml; optimum growth and melanization accompanied by morphological changes were recorded at 10 and 100 𝜇g/ml respectively. At intermediate doses growth and melanization were found to show a pattern of change over between growth and melanization and finally reached at an inverse relation at the respective optimal dose of response. Compared with defined sphingolipids, C<sub>2</sub> ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate, the results were mostly corroborative. The duality of biological response of sphingolipids as reported in numerous studies was comparable for the PTLF suggesting that its active component is a sphingolipid and showing its use for pigment recovery in vitiligo.</p>

				<title>Cloning and sequencing of complete 𝜏-crystallin cDNA from embryonic lens of <i>Crocodylus palustris</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0251-0259</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>𝜏-Crystallin is a taxon-specific structural protein found in eye lenses. We present here the cloning and sequencing of complete 𝜏-crystallin cDNA from the embryonic lens of <i>Crocodylus palustris</i> and establish it to be identical to the 𝛼-enolase gene from non-lenticular tissues. Quantitatively, the 𝜏-crystallin was found to be the least abundant crystallin of the crocodilian embryonic lenses. Crocodile 𝜏-crystallin cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR using primers designed from the only other reported sequence from duck and completed by 5&#8242;- and 3&#8242;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using crocodile gene specific primers designed in the study. The complete 𝜏-crystallin cDNA of crocodile comprises 1305 bp long ORF and 92 and 409 bp long untranslated 5&#8242;-and 3&#8242;-ends respectively. Further, it was found to be identical to its putative counterpart enzyme 𝛼-enolase, from brain, heart and gonad, suggesting both to be the product of the same gene. The study thus provides the first report on cDNA sequence of 𝜏-crystallin from a reptilian species and also re-confirms it to be an example of the phenomenon of gene sharing as was demonstrated earlier in the case of peking duck. Moreover, the gene lineage reconstruction analysis helps our understanding of the evolution of crocodilians and avian species.</p>

				<title>Water temperature and pH influence olfactory sensitivity to pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory ovarian pheromones in male <i>Barilius bendelisis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0273-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The attractive response and sexual activity elicited by pre-ovulatory steroid sulphate and post-ovulatory 15K-PGF pheromones are greater in wild caught tubercular males and immature males which express breeding tubercles on the snout (at 12–13 days post androgen implant) than in non-tubercular and non-androgen implanted males of freshwater fish <i>Barilius bendelisis</i>. This shows that circulatory androgens exert an activational effect on olfactory receptors of male fish. Wild caught tubercular males and androgen implanted juvenile males exhibit a high responsiveness to steroid sulphate at the water temperature and pH which fish experience during the pre-spawning phase. The male’s sensitivity to 15K-PGF is almost equally high at the water temperature and pH which they experience in wild during the both pre-spawning and spawning periods. This suggests that the differential olfactory sensitivity to the two classes of pheromones in androgen implanted males is due to the varied temperature and pH of water, and that during the breeding season the male’s olfactory sensitivity to PGF pheromone is more widespread than to the steroidal pheromone. An increased and decreased olfactory sensitivity in mature males to sex pheromones and L-alanine respectively during the breeding phase is in agreement with the hypothesis that pheromonal stimuli dominate over feeding stimuli to promote spawning success.</p>

				<title>Cocoon production, morphology, hatching pattern and fecundity in seven tropical earthworm species – a laboratory-based investigation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0283-0294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Data on the reproductive biology of seven Indian species of earthworms, viz. <i>Perionyx excavatus</i> Perrier, <i>Lampito mauritii</i> Kinberg, <i>Polypheretima elongata</i> (Perrier), <i>Pontoscolex corethrurus</i> (Muller), <i>Eutyphoeus gammiei</i> (Beddard), <i>Dichogaster modiglianii</i> (Rosa) and <i>Drawida nepalensis</i> Michaelsen are presented. The peregrine earthworms such as <i>Perionyx excavatus, Pontoscolex corethrurus, Dichogaster modiglianii</i>, and <i>Polypheretima elongata</i> are considered to be continuous breeders with high fecundity. Native <i>Lampito mauritii</i> and <i>Drawida nepalensis</i> are semi-continuous and <i>Eutyphoeus gammiei</i> discrete breeders. There is a dramatic increase in cocoon production by most earthworm species of Tripura in the summer and monsoon with a corresponding peak during April and July. Cocoon production decreased or ceased during winter. Temperature affected the incubation period of cocoons. With increase in temperature, incubation period increased in the endogeic worms, <i>Pontoscolex corethrurus, Polypheretima elongata</i> and <i>Drawida nepalensis</i> and decreased in the epigeic worms, <i>Perionyx excavatus</i> and <i>Dichogaster modiglianii</i>, within a temperature range between 28–32&#176;C under laboratory conditions. There was a significant (𝑃  &#60; 0.05) positive correlation between number of hatchlings per cocoon and incubation period in <i>Lampito mauritii</i>. High rate of cocoon production, short development time with high hatching success, as well as continuous breeding strategies in the epigeic species <i>Perionyx excavatus</i> and <i>Dichogaster modiglianii</i> and the top soil endogeic species, <i>Pontoscolex corethrurus, Drawida nepalensis</i> and <i>Lampito mauritii</i>, indicate their possible usefulness in vermiculture. The giant anecic worm, <i>Eutyphoeus gammiei</i>, which has a very long cocoon development time, discrete breeding strategy and very low rate of cocoon production, is not a suitable species for vermiculture.</p>

				<title>Operationalizing biodiversity for conservation planning</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0299-0308</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biodiversity has acquired such a general meaning that people now find it difficult to pin down a precise sense for planning and policy-making aimed at biodiversity conservation. Because biodiversity is rooted in place, the task of conserving biodiversity should target places for conservation action; and because all places contain biodiversity, but not all places can be targeted for action, places have to be prioritized. What is needed for this is a measure of the extent to which biodiversity varies from place to place. We do not need a precise measure of biodiversity to prioritize places. Relative estimates of similarity or difference can be derived using partial measures, or what have come to be called biodiversity surrogates. Biodiversity surrogates are supposed to stand in for general biodiversity in planning applications. We distinguish between true surrogates, those that might truly stand in for general biodiversity, and estimator surrogates, which have true surrogates as their target variable. For example, species richness has traditionally been the estimator surrogate for the true surrogate, species diversity. But species richness does not capture the differences in composition between places; the essence of biodiversity. Another measure, called complementarity, explicitly captures the differences between places as we iterate the process of place prioritization, starting with an initial place. The relative concept of biodiversity built into the definition of complementarity has the level of precision needed to undertake conservation planning.</p>

				<title>Representing biodiversity: data and procedures for identifying priority areas for conservation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0309-0326</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biodiversity priority areas together should represent the biodiversity of the region they are situated in. To achieve this, biodiversity has to be measured, biodiversity goals have to be set and methods for implementing those goals have to be applied. Each of these steps is discussed. Because it is impossible to measure all of biodiversity, biodiversity surrogates have to be used. Examples are taxa sub-sets, species assemblages and environmental domains. Each of these has different strengths and weaknesses, which are described and evaluated. In real-world priority setting, some combination of these is usually employed. While a desirable goal might be to sample all of biodiversity from genotypes to ecosystems, an achievable goal is to represent, at some agreed level, each of the biodiversity features chosen as surrogates. Explicit systematic procedures for implementing such a goal are described. These procedures use complementarity, a measure of the contribution each area in a region makes to the conservation goal, to estimate irreplaceability and flexibility, measures of the extent to which areas can be substituted for one another in order to take competing land uses into account. Persistence and vulnerability, which also play an important role in the priority setting process, are discussed briefly.</p>

				<page>0327-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The data needed to prioritize areas for biodiversity protection are records of biodiversity features – species, species assemblages, environmental classes – for each candidate area. Prioritizing areas means comparing candidate areas, so the data used to make such comparisons should be comparable in quality and quantity. Potential sources of suitable data include museums, herbariums and natural resource management agencies. Issues of data precision, accuracy and sampling bias in data sets from such sources are discussed and methods for treating data to minimize bias are reviewed.</p>

				<title>Place prioritization for biodiversity content</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0339-0346</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The prioritization of places on the basis of biodiversity content is part of any systematic biodiversity conservation planning process. The place prioritization procedure implemented in the ResNet software package is described. This procedure is primarily based on the principles of rarity and complementarity. Application of the procedure is demonstrated with two analyses, one data set consisting of the distributions of termite genera in Namibia, and the other consisting of the distributions of bird species in the Islas Malvinas/Falkland Islands. The attributes that data sets should have for the effective and reliable application of such procedures are discussed. The procedure used here is compared to some others that are also currently in use.</p>

				<title>Birds as surrogates for biodiversity: an analysis of a data set from southern Québec</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0347-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surrogacy analysis consists of determining a set of biotic or environmental parameters which can be rapidly assessed in the field and reliably used to prioritize places for biodiversity conservation. Whether adequate surrogate sets exist remains an open and relatively unexplored question though its solution is central to the aims of conservation biology. This paper analyses the surrogacy problem by prioritizing places using surrogate lists and comparing these results with those obtained by using more comprehensive species lists. More specifically, it explores</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the possibility of using bird distributions, which are often easily available, as surrogates for species at risk (endangered and threatened species), which are presumed to be an important component of biodiversity; and</li>
						<li>the methodological question of how spatial scale influences surrogate success.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The data set analysed, from southern Québec, is one of the most complete biotic data sets available at the regional scale. Contrary to some previous analyses, the results obtained suggest that the surrogacy problem is potentially solvable.</p>

				<page>0361-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An objective of biodiversity conservation activities is to minimize the exposure of biodiversity features to threatening processes and to ensure, as far as possible, that biodiversity persists in the landscape. We discuss how issues of vulnerability and persistence can and should be addressed at all stages of the conservation planning and implementation process. Procedures for estimating the likelihood of persistence and for measuring degrees of vulnerability at different spatial and temporal scales using subjective assessments, rules of thumb and analytical and simulation models are reviewed. The application of information on vulnerability and persistence to conservation planning and management is discussed under the headings of natural dynamics, replication of protection, levels of representation, source and sink population structures, refuges and critical resources, reserve design, habitat fragmentation and levels of management.</p>

				<title>Bet-hedging applications for conservation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0385-0392</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the early tenets of conservation biology is that population viability is enhanced by maintaining multiple populations of a species. The strength of this tenet is justified by principles of bet-hedging. Management strategies that reduce variance in population size will also reduce risk of extinction. Asynchrony in population fluctuations in independent populations reduces variance in the aggregate of populations whereas environmental correlation among areas increases the risk that all populations will go extinct. We review the theoretical rationale of bet-hedging and suggest applications for conservation management of least terns in Nebraska and grizzly bears in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States. The risk of extinction for least terns will be reduced if we can sustain the small central Platte River population in addition to the larger population on the lower Platte. Similarly, by restoring grizzly bears to the Bitterroot wilderness of Idaho and Montana can reduce the probability of extinction for grizzly bears in the Rocky Mountains of the United States by as much as 69–93%.</p>

				<title>The role of trade-offs in biodiversity conservation planning: linking local management, regional planning and global conservation efforts</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0393-0407</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biodiversity conservation planning requires trade-offs, given the realities of limited resources and the competing demands of society. If net benefits for society are important, biodiversity assessment cannot occur without other sectoral factors ``on the table”. In trade-offs approaches, the biodiversity value of a given area is expressed in terms of the species or other components of biodiversity that it has that are additional to the components protected elsewhere. That ``marginal gain” is called the <i>complementarity</i> value of the area. A recent whole-country planning study for Papua New Guinea illustrates the importance of complementarity-based trade-offs in determining priority areas for biodiversity conservation, and for designing economic instruments such as biodiversity levies and offsets. Two international biodiversity programs provide important new opportunities for biodiversity trade-offs taking complementarity into account. Both the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the Critical Ecosystems or ``hotspots” programs can benefit from an explicit framework that incorporates trade-offs, in which a balance is achieved not only by land-use allocation among areas, but also by the crediting of partial protection of biodiversity provided by sympathetic management within areas. For both international programs, our trade-offs framework can provide a natural linkage between local, regional and global planning levels.</p>

				<title>Choosing appropriate temporal and spatial scales for ecological restoration</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0409-0420</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Classic ecological restoration seems tacitly to have taken the Clementsian ``balance of nature” paradigm for granted: plant succession terminates in a climax community which remains at equilibrium until exogenously disturbed after which the process of succession is restarted until the climax is reached. Human disturbance is regarded as unnatural and to have commenced in the Western Hemisphere at the time of European incursion. Classic ecological restoration thus has a clear and unambiguous target and may be conceived as aiming to foreshorten the natural processes that would eventually lead to the climax of a given site, which may be determined by its state at ``settlement”. According to the new ``flux of nature” paradigm in ecology a given site has no <i>telos</i> and is constantly changing. Human disturbance is ubiquitous and long-standing, and at certain spatial and temporal scales is ``incorporated”. Any moment in the past 10,000 years that may be selected as a benchmark for restoration efforts thus appears to be arbitrary. Two prominent conservationists have therefore suggested that the ecological conditions in North America at the Pleistocene–Holocene boundary, prior to the anthropogenic extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna, be the target for ecological restoration. That suggestion explicitly assumes evolutionary temporal scales and continental spatial scales as the appropriate frame of reference for ecological restoration. However, ecological restoration should be framed in ecological spatio-temporal scales, which may be defined temporally in reference to ecological processes such as disturbance regimes and spatially in reference to ecological units such as landscapes, ecosystems, and biological provinces. Ecological spatio-temporal scales are also useful in achieving a scientifically defensible distinction between native and exotic species, which plays so central a role in the practice of ecological restoration and the conservation of biodiversity. Because post-settlement human disturbances have exceeded the limits of such scales, settlement conditions can be justified scientifically as appropriate targets of restoration efforts without recourse to obsolete teleological concepts of equilibria and without ignoring the presence and ecological influence of indigenous peoples.</p>

				<title>The principle of complementarity in the design of reserve networks to conserve biodiversity: a preliminary history</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0421-0435</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Explicit, quantitative procedures for identifying biodiversity priority areas are replacing the often ad hoc procedures used in the past to design networks of reserves to conserve biodiversity. This change facilitates more informed choices by policy makers, and thereby makes possible greater satisfaction of conservation goals with increased efficiency. A key feature of these procedures is the use of the principle of complementarity, which ensures that areas chosen for inclusion in a reserve network complement those already selected. This paper sketches the historical development of the principle of complementarity and its applications in practical policy decisions. In the first section a brief account is given of the circumstances out of which concerns for more explicit systematic methods for the assessment of the conservation value of different areas arose. The second section details the emergence of the principle of complementarity in four independent contexts. The third section consists of case studies of the use of the principle of complementarity to make practical policy decisions in Australasia, Africa, and America. In the last section, an assessment is made of the extent to which the principle of complementarity transformed the practice of conservation biology by introducing new standards of rigor and explicitness.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kleiber’s law in biology states that the specific metabolic rate (metabolic rate per unit mass) scales as 𝑀<sup>-1/4</sup> in terms of the mass 𝑀 of the organism. A long-standing puzzle is the (- 1/4) power in place of the usual expectation of (- 1/3) based on the surface to volume ratio in three-dimensions. While recent papers by physicists have focused exclusively on geometry in attempting to explain the puzzle, we consider here a specific law of physics that governs fluid flow to show how the (- 1/4) power arises under certain conditions. More generally, such a line of approach that identifies a specific physical law as involved and then examines the implications of a power law may illuminate better the role of physics in biology.</p>

				<title>Dynamic expression pattern of kinesin accessory protein in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0479-0487</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have identified the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of the non-motor accessory subunit of kinesin-II motor complex. It is homologous to the SpKAP115 of the sea urchin, KAP3A and KAP3B of the mouse, and SMAP protein in humans. <i>In situ</i> hybridization using a DmKAP specific cRNA probe has revealed a dynamic pattern of expression in the developing nervous system. The staining first appears in a subset of cells in the embryonic central nervous system at stage 13 and continues till the first instar larva stage. At the third instar larva stage the staining gets restricted to a few cells in the optic lobe and in the ventral ganglion region. It has also stained a subset of sensory neurons from late stage 13 and till the first instar larva stage. The DmKAP expression pattern in the nervous system corresponds well with that of Klp64D and Klp68D as reported earlier. In addition, we have found that the DmKAP gene is constitutively expressed in the germline cells and in follicle cells during oogenesis. These cells are also stained using an antibody to KLP68D protein, but mRNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization using KLP64D specific probe has not stained these cells. Together these results proved a basis for further analysis of tissue specific function of DmKAP in future.</p>

				<title>Comparison of the activities of wild type and mutant enhancing factor/mouse secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> proteins</title>

				<page>0489-0494</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Enhancing factor (EF) protein, an isoform of secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>), was purified as a modulator of epidermal growth factor from the small intestine of the Balb/c mouse. It was for the first time that a growth modulatory property of sPLA<sub>2</sub> was demonstrated. Deletion mutation analysis of EF cDNA carried out in our laboratory showed that enhancing activity and phospholipase activity are two separate activities that reside in the same molecule. In order to study the specific amino acids involved in each of these activities, two site-directed mutants of EF were made and expressed <i>in vitro</i>. Comparison of enhancing activity as well as phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity of these mutant proteins with that of wild type protein helped in identification of some of the residues important for both the activities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A number of factors that are known to influence genetic transformation were evaluated to optimize <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation of hypocotyl explants of cauliflower variety Pusa Snowball K-1. The binary vector p35SGUSINT mobilized into <i>Agrobacterium</i> strain GV2260 was used for transformation and transient GUS expression was used as the basis for identifying the most appropriate conditions for transformation. Explant age, preculture period, bacterial strain and density were found to be critical determinants of transformation efficiency. Using the optimized protocol, the synthetic <i>cryIA(b)</i> gene was mobilized into cauliflower. Molecular analyses of transgenics established the integration and expression of the transgene. Insect bioassays indicated the effectiveness of the transgene against infestation by diamondback moth (<i>Plutella xylostella</i>) larvae.</p>

				<title>Studies on Stibanate unresponsive isolates of <i>Leishmania donovani</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0503-0508</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar (KA) is generally caused by <i>Leishmania donovani</i>. Organic pentavalent antimonials (SbV) is the first line of treatment for KA. However, the number of KA patients unresponsive to treatment with Sb(V) is steadily increasing in India and elsewhere. The primary objective of this work is to determine the factor(s) associated with the rise of unresponsiveness. Analysis of the clonal population of parasites clearly indicated that wild type parasites isolated from KA patients who were clinically cured after treatment with Sb(V), were a mixture of resistant and sensitive cells. The resistant promastigotes were also resistant as amastigotes <i>in vivo</i>. It was further observed that Stibanate sensitive parasites can be made resistant to the drug by repeated passages in experimental animals followed by incomplete treatment with suboptimal doses of the drug. These results suggest that the steady rise in Sb(V) unresponsiveness of KA patients in India is due to infection with resistant parasites, generated as a result of irregular and often incomplete treatment of the patients.</p>

					<p>The ultrastructure of the corpuscles of Stannius (CS) of <i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i> reveals a homogenous cellular composition characterized by only one cell type, with large secretory granules and abundant ribosomal endoplasmic reticulum. These cells are comparable to the type 1 cell described in the CS of other teleosts; type 2 cells, whose presence is ubiquitous in the CS of freshwater species are absent in <i>H. fossilis</i>. Our data on the CS of <i>H. fossilis</i> demonstrate that not all freshwater species possess type 2 cells in their CS and these are not essential for life in freshwater.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Adaptation to high salinity and low or high temperature is essential for bacteria to survive. Accumulation of exogenous osmolytes is one of the ways that helps bacteria to survive under such extracellular stress. We have analysed the capability of various L-amino acids and their D-isomers to act as osmolytes and thus enable <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells to survive under various stress conditions. <i>E. coli</i> cells were grown in the presence or absence of L- and D-proline, alanine, serine and lysine under salt, heat and cold stresses. Of the various amino acids tested, L-proline, closely followed by L-serine turned out to be highly protective against environmental stresses. L-proline provided excellent protection (95%) against salt stress, followed by cold (60%) and heat (40%) stresses. D-amino acids on the other hand, proved to be highly inhibitory under stress conditions. Thus L-amino acids were found to be growth protectants under stress while their D-isomers were inhibitory during stress as well as normal conditions.</p>

				<title>The effect of some ecological factors on the intestinal parasite loads of the Asian elephant (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) in southern India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0521-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Some ecological factors that might potentially influence intestinal parasite loads in the Asian elephant (<i>Elephas maximus</i> Linn.) were investigated in the Nilgiris, southern India. Fresh dung samples from identified animals were analysed, and the number of eggs/g of dung used as an index of parasite load. Comparisons across seasons and habitats revealed that parasite loads were significantly higher during the dry season than the wet season, but were not different between the dry-deciduous and dry-thorn forests in either season. After accounting for the effect of age on body condition, there was no correlation between body condition, assessed visually using morphological criteria, and parasite load in either season. Individuals of different elephant herds were not characterized by distinct parasite communities in either season. When intra-individual variation was examined, samples collected from the same individual within a day differed significantly in egg densities, while the temporal variation over several weeks or months (within a season) was much less. Egg densities within dung piles were uniform, enabling a simpler collection method henceforth.</p>

				<title>Members of opposite sex mutually regulate gonadal recrudescence in the lizard <i>Calotes versicolor</i> (Agamidae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0529-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Adult males and females of the seasonally breeding lizard <i>Calotes versicolor</i> were subjected to various social situations under semi-natural conditions to explain the role of socio-sexual factors in gonadal recrudescence. They were grouped as:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>males and females,</li>
						<li>males and females separated by a wire mesh,</li>
						<li>same sex groups of males or females,</li>
						<li>castrated males with intact females and</li>
						<li>ovariectomized (OvX) females with intact males from postbreeding to breeding phase.</li>
					 </ol>
					 <p>Specimens collected from the wild during breeding season served as the control group. Plasma sex steroid levels (testosterone in male and 17𝛽-estradiol in female), spermatogenetic activity and vitellogenesis were the criteria to judge gonadal recrudescence. In intact males and females that were kept together, gonadal recrudescence and plasma sex steroids levels were comparable to those in wild-caught individuals. Gonadal recrudescence was at its least in all male and all female groups, and plasma sex steroids were at basal levels. Association with OvX females initiated testicular recrudescence but spermatogenetic activity progressed only up to the spermatid stage while males separated from females by wire mesh showed spermatogenetic activity for a shorter period. Females grouped with castrated males and those separated from males by wire mesh produced vitellogenic follicles. However, the total number and diameter of vitellogenic follicles, and plasma estradiol levels were lower than in the females grouped with intact males. The findings indicate that association with members of the opposite sex with progressively rising titers of sex steroids is crucial in both initiating and sustaining gonadal recrudescence in the lizard. Thus, members of the opposite sex mutually regulate gonadal recrudescence in the <i>C. versicolor</i>.</p>

				<title>Role of norepinephrine in the regulation of rapid eye movement sleep</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0539-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sleep and wakefulness are instinctive behaviours that are present across the animal species. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a unique biological phenomenon expressed during sleep. It evolved about 300 million years ago and is noticed in the more evolved animal species. Although it has been objectively identified in its present characteristic form about half a century ago, the mechanics of how REM is generated, and what happens upon its loss are not known. Nevertheless, extensive research has shown that norepinephrine plays a crucial role in its regulation. The present knowledge that has been reviewed in this manuscript suggests that neurons in the brain stem are responsible for controlling this state and presence of excess norepinephrine in the brain does not allow its generation. Furthermore, REM sleep loss increases levels of norepinephrine in the brain that affects several factors including an increase in Na-K ATPase activity. It has been argued that such increased norepinephrine is ultimately responsible for REM sleep deprivation, associated disturbances in at least some of the physiological conditions leading to alteration in behavioural expression and settling into pathological conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> is an enteric parasite that can kill host cells via a contact-dependent mechanism. This killing involves the amoebic surface protein referred to as the Gal/GalNAc lectin. The Gal/GalNAc lectin binds galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine allowing the adherence of amoebas to host cells. Involvement of the lectin in the pathogenesis of <i>E. histolytica</i> infection will be reviewed in this paper. The lectin has been shown to have very specific and substantial effects on adherence, cytotoxicity, and encystation. There is also possible involvement of the lectin in phagocytosis and caspase activation in host cells.</p>

				<title>What <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> and <i>Giardia lamblia</i> tell us about the evolution of eukaryotic diversity</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0559-0565</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> and <i>Giardia lamblia</i> are microaerophilic protists, which have long been considered models of ancient pre-mitochondriate eukaryotes. As transitional eukaryotes, amoebae and giardia appeared to lack organelles of higher eukaryotes and to depend upon energy metabolism appropriate for anaerobic conditions, early in the history of the planet. However, our studies have shown that amoebae and giardia contain splicoeosomal introns, ras-family signal-transduction proteins, ATP-binding casettes (ABC)-family drug transporters, Golgi, and a mitochondrion-derived organelle (amoebae only). These results suggest that most of the organelles of higher eukaryotes were present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes, and so dispute the notion of transitional eukaryotic forms. In addition, phylogenetic studies suggest many of the genes encoding the fermentation enzymes of amoebae and giardia derive from prokaryotes by lateral gene transfer (LGT). While LGT has recently been shown to be an important determinant of prokaryotic evolution, this is the first time that LGT has been shown to be an important determinant of eukaryotic evolution. Further, amoebae contain cyst wall-associated lectins, which resemble, but are distinct from lectins in the walls of insects (convergent evolution). Giardia have a novel microtubule-associated structure which tethers together pairs of nuclei during cell division. It appears then that amoebae and giardia tell us less about the origins of eukaryotes and more about the origins of eukaryotic diversity.</p>

				<title>Eukaryotic checkpoints are absent in the cell division cycle of <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0567-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fidelity in transmission of genetic characters is ensured by the faithful duplication of the genome, followed by equal segregation of the genetic material in the progeny. Thus, alternation of DNA duplication (S-phase) and chromosome segregation during the M-phase are hallmarks of most well studied eukaryotes. Several rounds of genome reduplication before chromosome segregation upsets this cycle and leads to polyploidy. Polyploidy is often witnessed in cells prior to differentiation, in embryonic cells or in diseases such as cancer. Studies on the protozoan parasite, <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> suggest that in its proliferative phase, this organism may accumulate polyploid cells. It has also been shown that although this organism contains sequence homologs of genes which are known to control the cell cycle of most eukaryotes, these genes may be structurally altered and their equivalent function yet to be demonstrated in amoeba. The available information suggests that surveillance mechanisms or ‘checkpoints’ which are known to regulate the eukaryotic cell cycle may be absent or altered in <i>E. histolytica</i>.</p>

				<title>The diagnostic implications of the separation of <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> and <i>Entamoeba dispar</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0573-0578</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For much of the last hundred years most cases of amoebiasis have been diagnosed by light microscopy. Only relatively recently have we become aware that this technique is usually incapable of distinguishing between two species – <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> and <i>E. dispar</i> – only the first of which is a pathogen. The implications of this for patient management and, even more, for the validity of epidemiological surveys, are only slowly being addressed. What is clear is that methods are urgently required to distinguish between infections with these two species and this review attempts to summarise some of those, which have been developed to meet this need.</p>

				<title>Amoebapore is an important virulence factor of <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0579-0587</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of expression of amoebapore A (AP-A) by antisense RNA caused a marked decrease in the virulence of the parasite. A four-fold over-expression of AP-A was obtained with plasmid (pA7) which has the <i>ap</i>-<i>a</i> gene under the control of gene <i>EhgLE-3-RP-L21</i>. The virulence of the transfected trophozoites, however, was also decreased. Excess of AP-A protein was found in the cytosol and a significant amount was released into the surrounding media. Transfection of the parasite with a plasmid (psAP-1) in which the <i>ap-a</i> gene was introduced with its own regulatory sequences, caused a total suppression of the transcription and translation of both the genomic and episomal <i>ap-a</i> genes. The silenced transfectant was not virulent at all. These results demonstrate that important factors need to be expressed at the correct cellular location and that the parasite has additional internal control mechanisms such as transcriptional gene silencing which can prevent excess amounts of gene expression.</p>

				<title>Catecholamines in <i>Entamoebae</i>: recent (re)discoveries</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0589-0593</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Free-living and enteric amoebae have similar two-stage life cycles, and both organisms depend on being able to monitor environmental conditions to determine whether to continue multiplying as trophozoites, or to differentiate into dormant or transmissible cysts. Conditions that support high trophozoite densities might also be expected to select for mechanisms of information exchange between these cells. We recently determined that trophozoites of at least one species of <i>Entamoeba</i> release and respond to catecholamine compounds during differentiation from the trophozoite stage into the cyst stage. It turns out that this is not an entirely novel finding, as a number of previous studies have demonstrated parts of this story in free-living or enteric amoebae. We briefly review here major points of the previous studies and describe some of our recent results that have extended them.</p>

				<title>Investigating amoebic pathogenesis using <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> DNA microarrays</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0595-0601</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>, a protozoan parasite, causes diarrhea and liver abscesses resulting in 50 million cases of infection worldwide annually. Elucidation of parasite virulence determinants has recently been investigated using genetic approaches. We have undertaken a genomics approach to identify novel virulence determinants in the parasite. A DNA microarray of <i>E. histolytica</i> is being developed based on sequenced genomic clones from the genome sequencing efforts of The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) and the Sanger Center. Hybridization of the slides with samples labelled differentially using fluorescent dyes allows the characterization of transcriptional profiles of genes under the biological conditions tested. Additionally, a genome-wide comparison of <i>E. histolytica</i> and <i>E. dispar</i> can be undertaken. The development of an <i>E. histolytica</i> microarray will be outlined and its uses in identifying novel virulence determinants and characterizing amoebic biology will be discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic diversity within <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> led to the re-description of the species 10 years ago. However, more recent investigation has revealed significant diversity within the re-defined species. Both protein-coding and non-coding sequences show variability, but the common feature in all cases is the presence of short tandem repeats of varying length and sequence. The ability to identify strains of <i>E. histolytica</i> may lead to insights into the population structure and epidemiology of the organism.</p>

				<title>Strategies of the protozoan parasite <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> to evade the innate immune responses of intestinal epithelial cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0609-0614</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecules expressed by the pathogenic ameoba <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> but weakly expressed or absent from the non-pathogenic ameoba <i>Entamoeba dispar</i> could be used by intestinal epithelial cells to discriminate between the two species and to initiate an appropriate inflammatory response. Among the possible molecules involved in this identification are the Gal/GalNac lectin and the lipophosphoglycan. Once the inflammatory response is initiated, <i>E. histolytica</i> trophozoites have to protect themselves against reactive nitrogen intermediates produced by intestinal epithelial cells, oxygen intermediates, and cytotoxic molecules released by activated neutrophils. By screening the <i>E. histolytica</i> genome, we have identified proteins that may play a role in the defence strategy of the parasite. One of these proteins, a serine proteinase inhibitor, inhibits human neutrophil cathepsin G, a key component of the host defence.</p>

				<title>Characterization of <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>-induced dephosphorylation in Jurkat cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0615-0618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> killing of host cells is contact dependent and mediated by a Gal/GalNAc lectin. Upon contact with amoeba a rapid and extensive dephosphorylation of tyrosine phosphorylated host cell proteins is observed. This effect is mediated by the Gal/GalNAc lectin. However, it requires intact cells, as purified lectin failed to induce dephosphorylation in Jurkat cells. The nonpathogenic, but morphologically identical amoeba, <i>Entamoeba moshkovskii</i> also did not induce dephosphorylation in target cells. Treatment of Jurkat cells with phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors has shown that a host phosphatase is responsible for dephosphorylation. However, it was found that the CD45 phosphotase was not necessary for dephosphorylation of host cell proteins.</p>

				<title>Close sequence identity between ribosomal DNA episomes of the non-pathogenic <i>Entamoeba dispar</i> and pathogenic <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0619-0627</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Entamoeba dispar</i> and <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> are now recognized as two distinct species – the former being nonpathogenic to humans. We had earlier studied the organization of ribosomal RNA genes in <i>E. histolytica</i>. Here we report the analysis of ribosomal RNA genes in <i>E. dispar</i>. The rRNA genes of <i>E. dispar</i>, like their counterpart in <i>E. histolytica</i> are located on a circular rDNA molecule. From restriction map analysis, the size of <i>E. dispar</i> rDNA circle was estimated to be 24.4 kb. The size was also confirmed by linearizing the circle with <i>Bsa</i>HI, and by limited DNAseI digestion. The restriction map of the <i>E. dispar</i> rDNA circle showed close similarity to EhR1, the rDNA circle of <i>E. histolytica</i> strain HM-1:IMSS which has two rDNA units per circle. The various families of short tandem repeats found in the upstream and downstream intergenic spacers (IGS) of EhR1 were also present in <i>E. dispar</i>. Partial sequencing of the cloned fragments of <i>E. dispar</i> rDNA and comparison with EhR1 revealed only 2.6% to 3.8% sequence divergence in the IGS. The region Tr and the adjoining <i>Pvu</i>I repeats in the IGS of EhR1, which are missing in those <i>E. histolytica</i> strains that have one rDNA unit per circle, were present in the <i>E. dispar</i> rDNA circle. Such close similarity in the overall organization and sequence of the IGS of rDNAs of two different species is uncommon. In fact the spacer sequences were only slightly more divergent than the 18S rRNA gene sequence which differs by 1.6% in the two species. The most divergent sequence between <i>E. histolytica</i> and <i>E. dispar</i> was the internal transcribed spacer, ITS2. Therefore, it was concluded that probes derived from the ITS1 and ITS2 sequences would be more reliable and reproducible than probes from the IGS regions used earlier for identifying these species.</p>

					<p>The <i>Yoga-Vasistha</i> is a rich and complex philosophical ‘poem’ (<i>kavya</i>) of epic length, written in classical Sanskrit by an unknown author some time between the 6th and 13th centuries CE, probably around the 7th century.

				<title>Monoclonal antibody affinity purification of a 78 kDa membrane protein of <i>Leishmania donovani</i> of Indian origin and its role in host–parasite interaction</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0665-0672</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monoclonal antibodies were raised against pathogenic promastigotes of <i>Leishmania donovani</i> of Indian origin. Among these, one was used for immuno-affinity purification of a 78 kDa membrane protein present in both the amastigote and promastigote forms of the parasite. Results of immunoblot experiments with the anti-78 kDa antibody revealed that the protein was present only in parasites belonging to the <i>L. donovani</i> complex. The expression of the protein was observed to be the same during different phases of growth of the promastigotes. Therefore, the 78 kDa protein is neither stage-specific nor differentially regulated. Surface iodination and subcellular fractionation of the promastigotes indicated that the protein was localized on the cell surface. The 78 kDa protein was found to inhibit the binding of promastigotes to macrophages significantly, suggesting that it may play a role in the process of infection. Thus, here we report the purification of a surface protein of <i>L. donovani</i> of Indian origin, which may play an important role in the process of infection.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Alterations in the tumour suppressor <i>p53</i> gene are among the most common defects seen in a variety of human cancers. In order to study the significance of the <i>p53</i> gene in the genesis and development of human glioma from Indian patients, we checked 44 untreated primary gliomas for mutations in exons 5–9 of the <i>p53</i> gene by PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing. Sequencing analysis revealed six missense mutations. The incidence of p53 mutations was 13.6% (6 of 44). All the six mutations were found to be located in the central core domain of p53, which carries the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain. These results suggest a rather low incidence but a definite involvement of p53 mutations in the gliomas of Indian patients.</p>

				<title>Characterization of urinary volatiles in Swiss male mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>): bioassay of identified compounds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0679-0686</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study was carried out to investigate the chemical nature of the urine of male mice and to assess its bioactivity. Urine of mature male mice was extracted with dichloromethane (1 : 1 ratio v/v) and analysed by gas-chromatography linked mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Ten different compounds such as alkanes, alcohols, etc. were detected in the urine. Among the ten, five compounds are specific to males, namely 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol (I), 3-amino-s-triazole (II), 4-ethyl phenol (III), 3-ethyl-2,7-dimethyl octane (IV) and 1-iodoundecane (V). The compound, 4-ethylphenol, has been previously reported in several strains of male mice. Furthermore, the compounds (II) and (IV) are similar to 2-<i>sec</i>-butylthiazole and dehydro-exo-brevicomin compounds which have already been reported in male mice. Bioassay revealed that compounds (II), (III) and (IV) were responsible for attracting females and in inducing aggression towards males, as compared to the other compounds, i.e. (I) and (V). The results indicate that these three volatiles (II, III and IV) of male mice appear to act as attractants of the opposite sex.</p>

				<title>Induction of blindness by formoguanamine hydrochloride in adult male roseringed parakeets <i>(Psittacula krameri)</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0687-0693</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Formoguanamine (2,4-diamino-<i>s</i>-triazine) was known to be an effective chemical agent in inducing blindness in poultry chicks, but not in adult birds. The present study was undertaken to demonstrate the influences, if any, of this chemical on the visual performance and retinal histology in an adult sub-tropical wild bird, the roseringed parakeet (<i>Psittacula krameri</i>). Formoguanamine (FG) hydrochloride was subcutaneously injected into adult parakeets at a dosage of 25 mg (dissolved in 0×75 ml physiological saline)/100 g body weight/day, for two consecutive days while the control birds were injected only with a placebo. The effects were studied after 10, 20 and 30 days of the last treatment of FG. Within 24 h of the treatment of FG, about 90% of the total birds exhibited lack of visual responses to any light stimulus and even absence of pupillary light reactions. The remaining birds became totally blind on the day following the last injection of FG and remained so till the end of investigation. At the microscopic level, conspicuous degenerative changes were noted in the outer pigmented epithelium and the photoreceptive layer of rods and cones in the retinas of FG treated birds. A significant reduction in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer was also found in the retinas of FG treated parakeets, compared to that in the control birds. However, the inner cell layers of the retina in the control and FG administered parakeets were almost identical. It deserves special mention that the effects of FG, noted after 30 days of last treatment, were not very different from those noted just after 10 days of treatment. Collectively, the results of the present investigation demonstrate that FG can be used as a potent pharmacological agent for inducing irreversible blindness through selective damage in retinal tissue even in the adult wild bird, thereby making FG treatment an alternative euthanasic device to a cumbersome, stressful, surgical method of enucleation of the ocular system for laboratory studies.</p>

				<title>Postnatal growth, age estimation and development of foraging behaviour in the fulvous fruit bat <i>Rousettus leschenaulti</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0695-0702</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study documents the postnatal growth, age estimation and development of the foraging behaviour of the fulvous fruit bat <i>Rousettus leschenaulti</i> under captive conditions. At birth, the young were naked and pink with closed eyes and folded pinnae. By day four of age, their eyes had opened and the pups began to move. The mean length of forearm in 5-day-old pups was 24.9 mm and body mass was 10.8 g, equivalent to 32.3% and 14.2% of the values from postpartum females. The length of forearm and body mass increased linearly until 45 and 50 days, respectively, and thereafter maintained an apparent stability. The epiphyseal gap of the fourth metacarpalphalangeal joint increased until 15 days, then decreased linearly until 75 days and thereafter closed. Age was estimated quantitatively, based on linear changes observed in the length of the forearm and epiphyseal gap. Pups began to roost separately, but adjacent to their mothers when 30 days old and flew clumsily when they were about 40 days old. After attaining clumsy flight, the young bats made independent foraging attempts feebly by biting and licking small fruit pieces. Young bats were engaged in suckling as well as ingesting fruits when they were about 50 days old. Between 55 and 65 days, they flew well and fed on fruits. At the age of 75 days, the young bats were completely weaned and at two months, their foraging behaviour was similar to that of their mothers. There was no significant difference in the growth pattern of the young maintained in captivity compared with those under natural conditions.</p>

				<title>Applications of inulin and oligofructose in health and nutrition</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0703-0714</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inulin and oligofructose belong to a class of carbohydrates known as fructans. The main sources of inulin and oligofructose that are used in the food industry are chicory and Jerusalem artichoke. Inulin and oligofructose are considered as functional food ingredients since they affect physiological and biochemical processes in rats and human beings, resulting in better health and reduction in the risk of many diseases. Experimental studies have shown their use as bifidogenic agents, stimulating the immune system of the body, decreasing the levels of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine, relieving constipation, decreasing the risk of osteoporosis by increasing mineral absorption, especially of calcium, reducing the risk of atherosclerosis by lowering the synthesis of triglycerides and fatty acids in the liver and decreasing their level in serum. These fructans modulate the hormonal level of insulin and glucagon, thereby regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by lowering the blood glucose levels; they are also effective in lowering the blood urea and uric acid levels, thereby maintaining the nitrogen balance. Inulin and oligofructose also reduce the incidence of colon cancer. The biochemical basis of these beneficial effects of inulin and oligofructose have been discussed. Oligofructoses are non-cariogenic as they are not used by <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> to form acids and insoluble glucans that are the main culprits in dental caries. Because of the large number of health promoting functions of inulin and oligofructose, these have wide applications in various types of foods like confectionery, fruit preparations, milk desserts, yogurt and fresh cheese, baked goods, chocolate, ice cream and sauces. Inulin can also be used for the preparation of fructose syrups.</p>

				<title>The effect of <i>Gongronema latifolium</i> extracts on serum lipid profile and oxidative stress in hepatocytes of diabetic rats</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0005</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diabetes is known to involve oxidative stress and changes in lipid metabolism. Many secondary plant metabolites have been shown to possess antioxidant activities, improving the effects of oxidative stress on diabetes. This study evaluated the effects of extracts from <i>Gongronema latifolium</i> leaves on antioxidant enzymes and lipid profile in a rat model of non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The results confirmed that the untreated diabetic rats were subjected to oxidative stress as indicated by significantly abnormal activities of their scavenging enzymes (low superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxide activities), compared to treated diabetic rats, and in the extent of lipid peroxidation (high malondialdehyde levels) present in the hepatocytes. The ethanolic extract of <i>G. latifolium</i> leaves possessed antioxidant activity as shown by increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and decreases in malondialdehyde levels. High levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol, which are typical of the diabetic condition, were also found in our rat models of diabetes. The ethanolic extract also significantly decreased triglyceride levels and normalized total cholesterol concentration.</p>

				<title>Effects of exogenous vitamin E supplementation on the levels of oxidants and antioxidants in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0007-0011</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidative stress has been recognized as a central feature of smoke induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant enzymes is also an established fact in these patients. But studies in regard to stable COPD patients and effect of vitamin E supplementation are lacking. Thirty patients with COPD were included in the study. Their baseline clinical examination, spirometry, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), alpha-tocopherol and red blood cell superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were measured. Twenty healthy non-smokers who were matched for age and sex served as controls. All the above parameters were repeated after 12 weeks of supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin E daily. The mean malondialdehyde levels in the patients at baseline were higher than controls (5.91 &#177; 1.23 nmol/ml vs 4.55 &#177; 1.51 nmol/ml, 𝑃 = 0.001), so also was plasma alpha-tocopherol levels (𝑃  &#60; 0.001), while SOD levels were lower in the patients compared to controls (1692 &#177; 259 units g/Hb vs 2451 &#177; 131 units g/Hb, 𝑃 &#60; 0.001). Exogenous vitamin E (400 IU per day) supplementation did not bring about any significant change in plasma alpha-tocopherol and SOD levels. The Pearson’s co-efficient of correlation between the levels of MDA, vitamin E, SOD; and spirometric measurements were not significant either on day 1 or after 12 weeks of vitamin E supplementation. The present study shows that initially the plasma lipid peroxide (MDA) levels are high and antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol and SOD) are low in patients with COPD. Exogenous supplementation with vitamin E does not have any significant effect on the spirometric measurements though it brings down the levels of MDA showing attenuation of further damage. However, inclusion of larger number of patients and supplementation with vitamin E for longer periods may throw more light on free radical injury and protective effects of antioxidants.</p>

				<title>Role of metal-induced reactive oxygen species generation in lung responses caused by residual oil fly ash</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0013-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inhalation of residual oil fly ash (ROFA) increases pulmonary morbidity in exposed workers. We examined the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ROFA-induced lung injury. ROFA was collected from a precipitator at Boston Edison Co., Everett, MA, USA. ROFA (ROFA-total) was suspended in saline, incubated for 24 h at 37&#176;C, centrifuged, and separated into its soluble (ROFA-sol.) and insoluble (ROFA-insol.) fractions. Sprague-Dawley rats were intratracheally instilled with saline or ROFA-total or ROFA-sol. or ROFA-insol. (1 mg/100 g body wt.). Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage cells were harvested at 4, 24, and 72 h after instillation. Chemiluminescence (CL) of recovered cells was measured as an index of ROS production, and tissue-lipid-peroxidation was assessed to determine oxidative injury. Significant amounts of Al, Fe, and Ni were present in ROFA-sol., whereas ROFA-insol. contained Fe, V, and Al. Using electron spin resonance (ESR), significantly more hydroxyl radicals were measured in ROFA-sol. as compared to ROFA-insol. None of the ROFA samples had an effect on CL or lipid peroxidation at 4 h. Treatment with ROFA-total and ROFA-insol. caused significant increases in both CL (at 24 h) and lipid peroxidation (at 24 and 72 h) when compared to saline control value. ROFA-sol. significantly reduced CL production at 72 h after treatment and had no effect on lipid peroxidation at any time point. In summary, ROFA, particularly its soluble fraction, generated a metal-dependent hydroxyl radical as measured by a cell-free ESR assay. However, cellular oxidant production and tissue injury were observed mostly with the ROFA-total and ROFA-insol. particulate forms. ROS generated by ROFA-sol. as measured by ESR appear not to play a major role in the lung injury caused after ROFA exposure.</p>

				<title>Application of electron spin resonance for evaluation of the level of free radicals in the myometrium in full-term pregnancy with normal labour and uterine inertia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0019-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to identify and quantify free radicals in the tissues of patients with normal physiological and pathological states of births, we developed a method to evaluate the amount of free radicals in myometrium of subplacental area and from body of uterus, using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Analysis of the concentration of free radicals in the myometrium in full-term pregnancy with normal labour and during uterine inertia was studied. The activities of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, cytochrome 𝑐 oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase in samples of these tissues were tested too. Low free radical concentrations in these tissues were associated with disturbances in contractile activity of myometrium along with reduction of Ca2<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, cytochrome 𝑐 oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase activity. There proved to be an association between the level of free radicals in the tissues and alteration in the physiological processes.</p>

				<title>Neutrophil superoxide-anion generating capacity in chronic smoking: effect of long-term 𝛼-tocopherol therapy</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0023-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated whether long-term 𝛼-tocopherol therapy in chronic smoking affects superoxide generating capacity of neutrophils <i>ex vivo</i>. To this purpose, we randomly assigned 128 male chronic smokers (37 &#177; 21 pack years of smoking) to treatment with placebo (𝑛 = 64) or 𝛼-tocopherol (400 IU dL-𝛼-tocopherol daily, 𝑛 = 64). After two years of therapy, we measured phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced superoxide production of isolated neutrophils and of diluted whole blood by monitoring reduction of ferricytochrome 𝑐 and luminolenhanced peroxidase-catalyzed chemiluminescence. Plasma lipids and lipoproteins were not different between the two treatment groups. As expected, concentrations of 𝛼-tocopherol in plasma and in low-density lipoproteins were markedly elevated in the supplemented group compared to the placebo group (+ 120%, P &#60; 0.0001 and + 83%, 𝑃  &#60; 0.0001, respectively). Consequently, resistance to <i>in vitro</i> oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (reflected by lag time of conjugated diene formation) was higher in the supplemented group than in the placebo group (+ 22%, 𝑃 &#60; 0.0001). Superoxide generating capacity of neutrophils and superoxide production in diluted whole blood did not differ between 𝛼-tocopherol and placebo group. It is concluded that in chronic smoking long-term supranormal 𝛼-tocopherol intake does not reduce neutrophil superoxide-anion generating capacity, despite large increases in the concentrations of 𝛼-tocopherol in plasma and in low-density lipoproteins.</p>

				<title>Nitric oxide production by rat bronchoalveolar macrophages or polymorphonuclear leukocytes following intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide or silica</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0029-0037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Exposure of the lung to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or silica results in an activation of alveolar macrophages (AMs), recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) into bronchoalveolar spaces, and the production of free radicals. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the free radicals generated by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations following either LPS or silica exposure. The purpose of the present study was to assess the relative contributions of AMs and PMNs to the amounts of NO produced by BAL cells following intratracheal (IT) instillation of either LPS or silica. Male Sprague Dawley rats (265–340 g body wt.) were given LPS (10 𝜇g/100 g body wt.) or silica (5 mg/100 g body wt.). BAL cells were harvested 18–24 h post-IT and enriched for AMs or PMNs using density gradient centrifugation. Media levels of nitrate and nitrite (NOx; the stable decomposition products of NO) were then measured 18 h after <i>ex vivo</i> culture of these cells. Following IT exposure to either LPS or silica, BAL cell populations were &#8764; 20% AMs and &#8764; 80% PMNs. After density gradient centrifugation of BAL cells from LPS- or silica-treated rats, cell fractions were obtained which were relatively enriched for AMs (&#8764; 60%) or PMNs (&#8764; 90%). The amounts of NOx produced by the AM-enriched fractions from LPS- or silica-treated rats were &#8764; 2–4-fold greater than that produced by the PMN-enriched fractions. Estimations of the relative contribution of AMs or PMNs to the NOx produced indicated that:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>following LPS treatment, 75%–89% of the NOx was derived from AMs and 11%–25% from PMNs; and</li>
						<li>following silica treatment, 76%–100% of the NOx was derived from AMs and 0–24% from PMNs.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Immunohistochemistry for inducible NO synthase on lung tissue sections supported these findings. We conclude that AMs are the major source of the NO produced by BAL cells during acute pulmonary inflammatory responses to LPS or silica.</p>

				<title>Justification for antioxidant preconditioning (or how to protect insulin-mediated actions under oxidative stress)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0039-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Insulin resistance is characterized by impaired glucose utilization in the peripheral tissues, accelerated muscle protein degradation, impaired antioxidant defences and extensive cell death. Apparently, both insulin and IGF-1 at physiological concentrations support cell survival by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-dependent and independent mechanisms. Postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are found in insulin resistance, which accompanies the so-called noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (diabetes type 2). Evidence also indicates that increased susceptibility of muscle cells and cardiomycoytes to oxidative stress is among the harmful complications of insulin resistance and diabetes. Limited knowledge showing benefits of preconditioning with antioxidants (vitamin C, E, 𝛼-lipoic acid, 𝑁-acetylcysteine) in order to protect insulin action under oxidative stress prompted the author to discuss the theoretical background to this approach. It should be stressed that antioxidant preconditioning is relevant to prevention of both diabetes- and insulin resistance-associated side-effects such as low viability and cell deletion. Furthermore, antioxidant conditioning promises to provide higher efficacy for clinical applications in myoblast transfer therapy and cardiomyoplasty.</p>

				<title>Formation of reactive oxygen species in rat epithelial cells upon stimulation with fly ash</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0051-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fly ash was used as a model for ambient particulate matter which is under suspicion to cause adverse pulmonary health effects. The fly ash was pre-sized and contained only particles &#60; 20 𝜇m including an ultrafine fraction (&#60; 100 nm) that contributed 31% to the particle number. In our study, we investigated the influence of fly ash on the promotion of early inflammatory reactions like the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat lung epithelial cells (RLE-6TN). Furthermore, we determined the formation of nitric oxide (NO). The cells show a clear dose-response relationship concerning the formation of ROS with regard to the mass of particles applied. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) added as a co-stimulus did not increase the formation of ROS induced by fly ash. Furthermore, in LPS (0.1 𝜇g/ml) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 1 ng/ml) pre-treated cells no increase in reactive oxygen species comparable to fly ash alone is observable. In presence of the metal chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO), ROS formation can be significantly reduced. Neither fly ash nor LPS induced a significant NO release in RLE-6TN cells.</p>

				<title>H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>-induced higher order chromatin degradation: A novel mechanism of oxidative genotoxicity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0057-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The genotoxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is well established. The underlying mechanism involves oxidation of DNA by ROS. However, we have recently shown that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the major mediator of oxidative stress, can also cause genomic damage indirectly. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pathologically relevant concentrations rapidly induces higher order chromatin degradation (HOCD), i.e. enzymatic excision of chromatin loops and their oligomers at matrix-attachment regions. The activation of endonuclease that catalyzes HOCD is a signalling event triggered specifically by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The activation is not mediated by an influx of calcium ions, but resting concentrations of intracellular calcium ions are required for the maintenance of the endonuclease in an active form. Although H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced HOCD can efficiently dismantle the genome leading to cell death, under sublethal oxidative stress conditions H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced HOCD may be the major source of somatic mutations.</p>

				<title>Pulmonary inflammation and crystalline silica in respirable coal mine dust: dose-response</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0061-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study describes the quantitative relationships between early pulmonary responses and the estimated lungburden or cumulative exposure of respirable-quartz or coal mine dust. Data from a previous bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) study in coal miners (𝑛 = 20) and nonminers (𝑛 = 16) were used including cell counts of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Miners’ individual working lifetime particulate exposures were estimated from work histories and mine air sampling data, and quartz lung-burdens were estimated using a lung dosimetry model. Results show that quartz, as either cumulative exposure or estimated lung-burden, was a highly statistically significant predictor of PMN response (𝑃 &#60; 0.0001); however cumulative coal dust exposure did not significantly add to the prediction of PMNs (𝑃 = 0.2) above that predicted by cumulative quartz exposure (𝑃 &#60; 0.0001). Despite the small study size, radiographic category was also significantly related to increasing levels of both PMNs and quartz lung burden (𝑃-values &#60; 0.04). SOD in BAL fluid rose linearly with quartz lung burden (𝑃 &#60; 0.01), but AM count in BAL fluid did not (𝑃 &#62; 0.4). This study demonstrates dose-response relationships between respirable crystalline silica in coal mine dust and pulmonary inflammation, antioxidant production, and radiographic small opacities.</p>

				<title>Three model systems measure oxidation/nitration damage caused by peroxynitrite</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0071-0076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diseases activate the innate immune response which causes ancillary damage to the human body. Peroxynitrite (OONO–) or its carbon dioxide derivatives cause oxidation/nitration and hence mutation to various body polymers e.g. DNA, RNA, protein, lipids and sugars. The control of the ancillary damage can come from antioxidants which inhibit control the amount of peroxynitrite available for damage. In this paper we have developed three different levels of antioxidant screening:</p>
					<ol> 
						<li>Peroxynitrite or SIN-1 reaction with luminol to produce light, and the inhibition of light by substances therefore represents antioxidation.</li>
						<li>Nicking of plasmid DNA occurs via oxidants: and is prevented by antioxidants.</li>
						<li>Detection of plasmid luciferase activity post-oxidation and infection indicates either prevention or repair of damage: via antioxidants.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We found green tea and a number of its polyphenolic constituents effective only at the first level of antioxidation, while extracts of various fruit help at all levels antioxidation. In the final analysis, a combination of green tea extracts and fruits is suggested to produce more complete antioxidant protection.</p>

				<page>0077-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study was carried out to observe the cytotoxicity of yellow sand in comparison with silica and titanium dioxide in a rat alveolar type II cell line (RLE-6TN). Yellow sand (China Loess) was obtained from the loess layer in the Gunsu Province of China. The mean particle diameter of yellow sand was about 0.003 &#177; 0.001 mm. Major elements of yellow sand were Si(27.7 &#177; 0.6%), Al(6.01 &#177; 0.17%), and Ca(5.83 &#177; 0.23%) in that order. Silica and yellow sand significantly decreased cell viability and increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. All three particles increased the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. TiO<sub>2</sub> did not change Fenton activity, while silica induced a slight increase of Fenton activity. In contrast, yellow sand induced a significant increase of Fenton activity. Silica, yellow sand and TiO<sub>2</sub> induced significant nitrite formations in RLE-6TN cells. Silica showed the highest increase in nitrite formation, while yellow sand induced the least formation of nitrite. Silica and yellow sand increased the release of TNF-𝛼. Based on these results, we suggest that yellow sand can induce cytotoxicity in RLE-6TN cells and reactive oxygen species, Fenton activity and reactive nitrogen species might be involved in this toxicity.</p>

				<title>Role of reactive oxygen species in extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation and 6-hydroxydopamine cytotoxicity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0083-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of reports indicate the potential for redox signalling via extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) during neuronal injury. We have previously found that sustained ERK activation contributes to toxicity elicited by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the B65 neuronal cell line. To determine whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in mediating ERK activation and 6-OHDA toxicity, we examined the effects of catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and metalloporphyrin antioxidants (‘SOD mimetics’) on 6-OHDA-treated cells. We found that catalase and metalloporphyrin antioxidants not only conferred protection against 6-OHDA but also inhibited development of sustained ERK phosphorylation in both differentiated and undifferentiated B65 cells. However, exogenously added SOD1 and heat-inactivated catalase had no effect on either toxicity or sustained ERK phosphorylation. This correlation between antioxidant protection and inhibition of 6-OHDA-induced sustained ERK phosphorylation suggests that redox regulation of ERK signalling cascades may contribute to neuronal toxicity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) from healthy donors were tested for stimulated release of superoxide anions after being incubated with serum of welders and of a group of unexposed individuals. These two groups were further subdivided either according to age or to smoking habits. The experiments showed that stimulated superoxide production from PMN was inhibited (𝑃 &#60; 0.05) by serum from young smokers as compared to that of young nonsmokers, both from the unexposed group. Incubation of PMN with serum from elderly nonsmoking individuals decreased superoxide production as compared to incubation with serum from young nonsmoking individuals, both from the unexposed group. A decrease in superoxide production by incubation with serum of welders as compared to that of unexposed individuals was significant only when the comparison was carried out between the young, non-smoking subgroups. These findings suggest that age, smoking, and exposure to oxidants induce appearance in serum of factors that affect the PMN function.</p>

				<title>Induction of interleukin-6 by coal containing bioavailable iron is through both hydroxyl radical and ferryl species</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coal mining causes health problems, such as pneumoconiosis. We have previously shown that prevalence of pneumoconiosis in workers from various coalmine regions positively correlates with levels of bioavailable iron (BAI) in the coals from that region. In the present study, the nature of reactive oxygen species formed by BAI in the coals and its mechanisms of the induction of biological responses were investigated. Human lung epithelial cell line, A549 cells, were used to examine the induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is known to play a crucial role in the development of pneumoconiosis. We found that levels of IL-6 protein as well as its mRNA were significantly increased in the cells treated for 24 h with 20 𝜇g/cm<sup>2</sup> of the BAI-containing Pennsylvania (PA) coal; for example we observed 6.7–fold increase in IL-6 protein. Levels of IL-6 protein in cells treated with the Utah (UT) coal containing low-BAI were only 1.9-fold of the control levels. The enhancing effect on the IL-6 by the PA coal was similar to that caused by hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) all had inhibitory effects on the PA coal-induced IL-6 formation. However, CAT had the least protective effect as compared to SOD and NAC. Our results indicate that BAI in the PA coal may induce IL-6 through both ferryl species (via iron autoxidation) and hydroxyl radicals (via the Fenton/Haber Weiss reactions).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This investigation focuses on the application of an <i>in vitro</i> assay in elucidating the role of lung lining fluid antioxidants in the protection against inhaled particles, and to compare the toxicities of different airborne particulate matter (PM), PM<sub>10</sub>, collections from South Wales, UK.</p>
					<p>PM collections from both urban and industrial sites caused 50% oxidative degradation of DNA <i>in vitro</i> at concentrations as low as 12.9 &#177; 2.1 𝜇g ml<sup>–1</sup> and 4.9 &#177; 0.9 mg ml<sup>–1</sup> respectively. The primary source of this bioreactivity was found to be the soluble fraction of both particle collections. The coarser PM<sub>10–2.5</sub> fraction also showed greater oxidative bioreactivity than the PM<sub>2.5–0.1</sub> in both cases. When repeated in the presence of a low molecular weight fraction of fresh pulmonary lavage fluid, as well as in artificial lung lining fluid (200 𝜇M urate, glutathione and ascorbate), the DNA damage was significantly reduced in all cases (𝑃 &#60; 0.05). The antioxidants exerted a greater effect on the industrial samples than on the urban samples, and on the PM<sub>10–2.5</sub> fractions than on the PM<sub>2.5–0.1</sub> fractions, supporting the previous findings that respirable PM and urban samples contain fewer free radical sources than inhalable PM and industrial samples.</p>

				<title>Quantification of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid by colorimetric competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay</title>

				<page>0109-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analysis of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictor produced by the cytochrome P450 pathway, presently requires high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). To simplify 20-HETE analysis, competitive ELISAs were developed using polyclonal anti-20-HETE coated ELISA plates to which free 20-HETE and 20-HETE conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase (AP) were added. Assays were developed with and without a proprietary enhancer solution which allows for the extraction-free measurement of 20-HETE in urine samples. The bound 20-HETE-HRP or 20-HETE-AP was detected using 3,3&#8242;,5,5,&#8242;-tetramethylbenzidine and p-nitrophenyl phosphate, respectively. Sensitivities expressed as 80% B/B0, were 0.1 ng/ml for the HRP assay, and 0.5 ng/ml for the AP assay, with 𝑟<sup>2</sup> = 0.99 for both formats. Of the 17 lipids tested for cross-reactivity, arachidonic acid showed the highest (0.32%) followed by racemic 5-HETE (0.07%) and 8,9-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) (0.04%). Preliminary validation experiments examining serum and urine concentrations of 20-HETE yield values that fall within the ranges established by GC/MS in the literature. These ELISAs provide simple and inexpensive methods for the analysis of 20-HETE in biological samples.</p>

				<title>Lucigenin chemiluminescence assay as an adjunctive tool for assessment of various stages of inflammation: A study of quiescent inflammatory cells</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0115-0119</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simple, fast, precise and biologically relevant toxicity assay for screening cytotoxicity of minerals would have distinct advantages due to its cost benefits and relative savings in time. Furthermore, a bioassay to differentiate acute and chronic <i>in vivo</i> pulmonary reactions could have potential value as predictors of fibrogenicity and pathogenicity. In this study we examined the potential use of lucigenin as a probe to evaluate the correlation between chemiluminescence (CL) generated by alveolar macrophages with the known cytotoxicity and pathogenicity by conventional bioassays. In this study, we used small doses of dust (20 𝜇g) to minimize cellular overload and to maintain homeostasis. Crystalline silica a highly fibrogenic dust was used as positive control and results are compared with those for bentonite, kaolin and talc. Among the three minerals compared with silica, bentonite was more reactive (27%) in CL assay and declined sharply compared to other minerals. This sudden decline in bentonite CL is caused by cytotoxicity leading to cell death. CL-induced by talc was comparable to silica and declines slowly. Kaolin on the other hand produced relatively a weaker (25%) CL compared to silica. Our data using relatively low doses of dust suggest that the CL assay may have a better predictive value in cytotoxicity evaluations compared to conventional toxicity assays.</p>

				<title>Phenolic antioxidants attenuate hippocampal neuronal cell damage against kainic acid induced excitotoxicity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0121-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Increasing evidence supports the role of excitotoxicity in neuronal cell injury. Thus, it is extremely important to explore methods to retard or reverse excitotoxic neuronal injury. In this regard, certain dietary compounds are begining to receive increased attention, in particular those involving phytochemicals found in medicinal plants in alleviating neuronal injury. In the present study, we examined whether medicinal plant extracts protect neurons against excitotoxic lesions induced by kainic acid (KA) in female Swiss albino mice. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (200 mg and 2 mg/kg body wt. respectively) and KA (0.25 𝜇g in a volume of 0.5 𝜇l) was administered to mice by intra hippocampal injections. The results showed an impairment of the hippocampus region of brain after KA injection. The lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content were significantly (𝑃 &#60; 0.05) increased in comparison to controls. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity (EC 1.11.1.9) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content declined after appearance of excitotoxic lesions. As GPx and GSH represent a major pathway in the cell for metabolizing hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), their depletion would be expected to allow H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to accumulate to toxic levels. Dried ethanolic plant extracts of <i>Withania somnifera</i> (WS), <i>Convolvulus pleuricauas</i> (CP) and <i>Aloe vera</i> (AV) dissolved in distilled water were tested for their total antioxidant activity. The diet was prepared in terms of total antioxidant activity of plant extracts. The iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) reducing activity of plant extracts was also tested and it was found that WS and AV were potent reductants of Fe<sup>3+</sup> at pH 5.5. CP had lower Fe<sup>3+</sup> reducing activity in comparison to WS and AV. Plant extracts given singly and in combination 3 weeks prior to KA injections resulted in a decrease in neurotoxicity. Measures of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl declined. GPx activity and GSH content were elevated in hippocampus supplemented with WS and combination of WS + CP + AV. However, when CP and AV were given alone, the changes in the GPx activity and GSH content were not significant. Although the major factors involved in these properties of phytochemicals remain to be specified, the finding of this study has suggested that phytochemicals present in plant extracts mitigate the effects of excitotoxicity and oxidative damage in hippocampus and this might be accomplished by their antioxidative properties.</p>

				<title>Evidence for lipopolysaccharide-induced differentiation of RAW264⋅ 7 murine macrophage cell line into dendritic like cells</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0129-0134</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was studied. LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells increased in cell size and acquired distinct dendritic morphology. At the optimal dose of LPS (1 𝜇g/ml), almost 70% RAW264.7 cells acquired dendritic morphology. Flow cytometric studies indicate that the cell surface markers known to be expressed on dendritic cells and involved in antigen presentation and T cell activation (B7.1, B7.2, CD40, MHC class II antigens and CD1d) were also markedly upregulated on LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. Our results suggest the possibility that LPS by itself could constitute a sufficient signal for differentiation of macrophages into DC-like cells.</p>

				<title>Sample size for collecting germplasms – a polyploid model with mixed mating system</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0155-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper discusses a general expression for determining the minimum sample size (plants) for a given number of seeds or vice versa for capturing multiple allelic diversity. The model considers sampling from a large 2 k-ploid population under a broad range of mating systems. Numerous expressions/results developed for germplasm collection/regeneration for diploid populations by earlier workers can be directly deduced from our general expression by assigning appropriate values of the corresponding parameters. A seed factor which influences the plant sample size has also been isolated to aid the collectors in selecting the appropriate combination of number of plants and seeds per plant. When genotypic multiplicity of seeds is taken into consideration, a sample size of even less than 172 plants can conserve diversity of 20 alleles from 50,000 polymorphic loci with a very large probability of conservation (0.9999) in most of the cases.</p>

				<title>Molecular screening for Yq microdeletion in men with idiopathic oligozoospermia and azoospermia</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0163-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Infertility affects 15% couples attempting pregnancy and in 40–50% of these cases the male partner has qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of sperm production. Microdeletions in the azoospermia factor (AZF) region on the long arm of the Y chromosome are known to be associated with spermatogenic failure and have been used to define three regions on Yq (AZFa, AZFb and AZFc) which are critical for spermatogenesis and are recurrently deleted in infertile males. Semen analysis was carried out on one hundred and twenty five infertile males with oligozoospermia and azoospermia. Cytogenetic analysis was done for all the cases and in all cytogenetically normal cases (𝑛 = 83) microdeletion analysis was carried out on DNA extracted from peripheral blood using PCR. The sequence tagged sites (STS) primers sY84, sY86 (AZFa); sY127, sY134 (AZFb); sY254, sY255 (AZFc) were used for each case. Eight of the eighty three cases (9.63%) showed deletion of at least one of the STS markers. Correlation of phenotype with microdeletion was done in each case to determine any phenotype association with deletion of particular AZF locus. Based on the present study, the frequency of microdeletion in the Indian population is 9.63%. This study emphasizes the need for PCR analysis for determining genetic aetiology in cases with idiopathic severe testiculopathy.</p>

				<title>Sequence analysis corresponding to the PPE and PE proteins in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and other genomes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0169-0179</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amino acid sequence analysis corresponding to the PPE proteins in H37Rv and CDC1551 strains of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> genomes resulted in the identification of a previously uncharacterized 225 amino acidresidue common region in 22 proteins. The pairwise sequence identities were as low as 18%. Conservation of amino acid residues was observed at fifteen positions that were distributed over the whole length of the region. The secondary structure corresponding to this region is predicted to be a mixture of 𝛼-helices and 𝛽-strands. Although the function is not known, proteins with this region specific to mycobacterial species may be associated with a common function. We further observed another group of 20 PPE proteins corresponding to the conserved C-terminal region comprising 44 amino acid residues with GFxGT and PxxPxxW sequence motifs. This region is preceded by a hydrophobic region, comprising 40–100 amino acid residues, that is flanked by charged amino acid residues. Identification of conserved regions described above may be useful to detect related proteins from other genomes and assist the design of suitable experiments to test their corresponding functions. Amino acid sequence analysis corresponding to the PE proteins resulted in the identification of tandem repeats comprising 41–43 amino acid residues in the C-terminal variable regions in two PE proteins (Rv0978 and Rv0980). These correspond to the AB repeats that were first identified in some proteins of the <i>Methanosarcina mazei</i> genome, and were demonstrated as surface antigens. We observed the AB repeats also in several other proteins of hitherto uncharacterized function in <i>Archaea</i> and <i>Bacteria</i> genomes. Some of these proteins are also associated with another repeat called the C-repeat or the PKD-domain comprising 85 amino acid residues. The secondary structure corresponding to the AB repeat is predicted mainly as 4 𝛽-strands. We suggest that proteins with AB repeats in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and other genomes may be associated as surface antigens. The <i>M. leprae</i> genome, however, does not contain either the AB or C-repeats and different proteins may therefore be recruited as surface antigens in the <i>M. leprae</i> genome compared to the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> genome.</p>

				<title>Expression of the neurotrophin receptors Trk A and Trk B in adult human astrocytoma and glioblastoma</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0181-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Neurotrophins and their receptors of the Trk family play a critical role in proliferation, differentiation and survival of the developing neurons. There are reports on their expression in neoplasms too, namely, the primitive neuroectodermal tumours of childhood, and in adult astrocytic gliomas. The involvement of Trk receptors in tumour pathogenesis, if any, is not known. With this end in view, the present study has examined 10 tumour biopsy samples (identified as astrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma and glioblastoma) and peritumoral brain tissue of adult patients, for the presence of Trk A and Trk B receptors, by immunohistochemistry. The nature of the tumour samples was also confirmed by their immunoreactivity (IR) to glial fibrillary acidic protein. In the peritumoral brain tissue, only neurons showed IR for Trk A and Trk B. On the contrary, in the tumour sections, the IR to both receptors was localized in the vast majority of glia and capillary endothelium. There was an obvious pattern of IR in these gliomas: high levels of IR were present in the low-grade (type I and II) astrocytoma; whereas in the advanced malignant forms (WHO grade IV giant cell glioblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme) the IR was very weak. These findings suggest that Trk A and Trk B are involved in tumour pathogenesis, especially in the early stage, and may respond to signals that elicit glial proliferation, and thus contribute to progression towards malignancy.</p>

				<page>0189-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Mus terricolor</i> I, II and III are the three chromosomal species which differ in stable autosomal short-arm heterochromatin variations established in homozygous condition. Analysis of meiosis in the laboratorygenerated F<sub>1</sub> male hybrids from crosses (both ways) between <i>M. terricolor</i> I and II and between <i>M. terricolor</i> I and III shows high frequencies of pairing abnormalities at pachytene. The backcross (N3 generation) male hybrids between <i>M. terricolor</i> I and II have meiotic abnormalities as in the F<sub>1</sub> male hybrids, though to a lesser extent. They show difference in pairing abnormalities in the different karyotypic forms; the backcross hybrids heterozygous for the heterochromatic short arms have more anomalies compared to the homokaryotypic hybrids. This suggests a negative influence of the heterochromatin heterozygosity in meiotic pairing. The results indicate a role for heterochromatin variations in the development of a reproductive barrier in the speciating <i>M. terricolor</i> complex.</p>

				<title>Genetic analysis of Karnal bunt (<i>Neovossia indica</i>) resistance in wheat</title>

				<page>0199-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Embryos excised from seeds of six generations (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>, BC<sub>1</sub>, BC<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>) of a cross WH 283 &#215; WH 533 were cultured on modified MS medium already inoculated with secondary sporidia of <i>Neovossia indica</i>. Significant variations for callusing response (CR) (54.55–75.55%) were observed among generations but the presence or absence of <i>N. indicia</i> did not affect callusing response. A clear inhibition zone (IZ) was formed around each embryo showing callusing. The diameter of IZ varied significantly among generations and was maximum in the resistant genotype, WH 283 (3.60 cm). Fresh weight and dry weight of calli, initiated from embryo cultured and inoculated with <i>N. indica</i>, varied significantly among generations. Coefficient of infection as well as percentage of infection reflected the overdominance of susceptibility. Generation mean analysis showed that the three parameter model was adequate for diameter of IZ only. Six-parameter model showed that additive (in presence of <i>N. indica</i>), additive and additive &#215; dominance (in absence of <i>N. indica</i>) effects were also significant. Complementary type of epistasis for fresh weight of calli and dominance, and dominance &#215; dominance effects for dry weight of calli were observed in the presence of <i>N. indica</i>. Magnitude of additive effects was higher for diameter of IZ in three parameter model. Therefore, selection might assist in improving this trait and thus indirectly help in attaining the resistance towards <i>N. indica</i>.</p>

				<title>Role of matrix metalloprotease-2 in oxidant activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase by hydrogen peroxide in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle plasma membrane</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0205-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Exposure of bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle plasma membrane suspension with the oxidant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1 mM) stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity. We sought to determine the role of matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) in stimulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the smooth muscle plasma membrane. The smooth muscle membrane possesses a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protease activity in the gelatin containing zymogram having an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa. The 72 kDa protease activity was found to be inhibited by EGTA, 1 : 10-phenanthroline, 𝛼<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-2 (TIMP-2) indicating that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 72 kDa protease is the MMP-2. Western immunoblot studies of the membrane suspension with polyclonal antibodies of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 revealed that MMP-2 and TIMP-2, respectively, are the ambient matrix metalloprotease and the corresponding tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease in the membrane.</p>
					<p>In addition to increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also enhanced the activity of the smooth muscle plasma membrane associated protease activity as evidenced by its ability to degrade <sup>14</sup>C-gelatin. The protease activity and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity were prevented by the antioxidant, vitamin E, indicating that the effect produced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was due to reactive oxidant species(es). Both basal and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stimulated MMP-2 activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity were inhibited by the general inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases: EGTA, 1 : 10-phenanthroline, 𝛼<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin and also by TIMP-2 (the specific inhibitor of MMP-2) indicating that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased MMP-2 activity and that subsequently stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity in the plasma membrane. This was further confirmed by the following observations:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>adding low doses of MMP-2 or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to the smooth muscle membrane suspension caused submaximal increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity, and pretreatment with TIMP-2 prevents the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity;</li> 
						<li>combined treatment of the membrane with low doses of MMP-2 and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> augments further the Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity caused by the respective low doses of either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or MMP-2; and</li>
						<li>pretreatment with TIMP-2 prevents the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>ATPase activity in the membrane caused by the combined treatment of MMP-2 and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</li>

				<title>Regulation of glucose utilization and lipogenesis in adipose tissue of diabetic and fat fed animals: Effects of insulin and manganese</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0215-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to evaluate the modulatory effects of manganese, high fat diet fed and alloxan diabetic rats were taken and the changes in the glucose oxidation, glycerol release and effects of manganese on these parameters were measured from adipose tissue. An insulin-mimetic effect of manganese was observed in the adipose tissue in the controls and an additive effect of insulin and manganese on glucose oxidation was seen when Mn<sup>2+</sup> was added <i>in vitro</i>. The flux of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis was significantly decreased in high fat fed animals. Although the <i>in vitro</i> addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> was additive with insulin when <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> was measured from control animals, it was found neither in young diabetic animals (6–8 weeks old) nor in the old (16 weeks old). Both insulin and manganese caused an increased oxidation of carbon-1 of glucose and an increase of its incorporation into <sup>14</sup>C-lipids in the young control animals; the additive effect of insulin and manganese suggests separate site of action. This effect was decreased in fat fed animals, diabetic animals and old animals. Manganese alone was found to decrease glycerol in both the control and diabetic adipose tissue in <i>in vitro</i> incubations. The results of the effects of glucose oxidation, lipogenesis, and glycerol release in adipose tissue of control and diabetic animals of different ages are presented together with the effect of manganese on adipose tissue from high fat milk diet fed animals.</p>

				<title>Purification and characterization of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase from moss chloronema cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0223-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have demonstrated the presence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase (PK) in chloronema cells of the moss <i>Funaria hygrometrica</i>. The kinase, with a molecular mass of 70,000 daltons (PK70), was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulphate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and calmodulin (CaM)-agarose affinity chromatography. The kinase activity was stimulated at a concentration of 50 𝜇M free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and was further enhanced 3–5-fold with exogenously added 3–1000 nm moss calmodulin (CaM). Autophosphorylation was also stimulated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM. Under <i>in vitro</i> conditions, PK70 phosphorylated preferentially lysine-rich substrates such as HIIIS and HVS. This PK shares epitopes with the maize Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent/calmodulin-stimulated PK (CCaMK) and also exhibits biochemical properties similar to the maize, lily, and tobacco CCaMK. We have characterized it as a moss CCaMK.</p>

				<title>Metabolic characteristics of an aerobe isolated from a methylotrophic methanogenic enrichment culture</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0235-0242</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An anaerobic methylotrophic methanogenic enrichment culture, with sustained metabolic characteristics, including that of methanation for over a decade, was the choice of the present study on interspecies interactions. Growth and methanation by the enrichment were suppressed in the presence of antibiotics, and no methanogen grown on methanol could be isolated using stringent techniques. The present study confirmed syntrophic metabolic interactions in this enrichment with the isolation of a strain of <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. The organism had characteristic metabolic versatility in metabolizing a variety of substrates including alcohols, aliphatic acids, amino acids, and sugars. Anaerobic growth was favoured with nitrate in the growth medium. Cells grown anaerobically with methanol, revealed maximal nitrate reductase activity. Constitutive oxidative activity of the membrane system emerged from the high-specific oxygen uptake and nitrate reductase activities of the aerobically and anerobically grown cells respectively. Cells grown anaerobically on various alcohols effectively oxidized methanol in the presence of flavins, cofactor FAD and the methanogenic cofactor F<sub>420</sub>, suggesting a constitutive alcohol oxidizing capacity. In cells grown anaerobically on methanol, the rate of methanol oxidation with F<sub>420</sub> was three times that of FAD. Efficient utilization of alcohols in the presence of F<sub>420</sub> is a novel feature of the present study. The results suggest that utilization of methanol by the mixed culture would involve metabolic interactions between the <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. and the methanogen(s). Methylotrophic, methanogenic partnership involving an aerobe is a novel feature hitherto unreported among anaerobic syntrophic associations and is of ecological significance.</p>

				<title>Mycelial colonization by bradyrhizobia and azorhizobia</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0243-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study examines mycelial colonization of common soil fungi by bradyrhizobia and an azorhizobial strain, resulting in the forming of biofilms. The effects of the fungal exudates on a bradyrhizobial strain have also been investigated. Bradyrhizobia gradually colonized the mycelia for about 18 days, after which the biofilm structures collapsed with the release of the rhizobial cell clusters to the culture medium. The azorhizobial strain showed differential colonization of the mycelia. In general, there were no considerable mycotoxin effects of the fungal exudates on the bradyrhizobial strain used, instead the rhizobial strain utilized the exudates as a source of nutrition. This study indicates that the present microbial association with biofilm formation has important implications in the survival of rhizobia under adverse soil conditions devoid of vegetation. Further, it could have developed an as yet unidentified nitrogen fixing system that could have contributed to the nitrogen economy of soils.</p>

				<title>Viral mimicry of the complement system</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0249-0264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The complement system is a potent innate immune mechanism consisting of cascades of proteins which are designed to fight against and annul intrusion of all the foreign pathogens. Although viruses are smaller in size and have relatively simple structure, they are not immune to complement attack. Thus, activation of the complement system can lead to neutralization of cell-free viruses, phagocytosis of C3b-coated viral particles, lysis of virus-infected cells, and generation of inflammatory and specific immune responses. However, to combat host responses and succeed as pathogens, viruses not only have developed/adopted mechanisms to control complement, but also have turned these interactions to their own advantage. Important examples include poxviruses, herpesviruses, retroviruses, paramyxoviruses and picornaviruses. In this review, we provide information on the various complement evasion strategies that viruses have developed to thwart the complement attack of the host. A special emphasis is given on the interactions between the viral proteins that are involved in molecular mimicry and the complement system.</p>

				<title>Vaccinia complement control protein: Multi-functional protein and a potential wonder drug</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0265-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) was one of the first viral molecules demonstrated to have a role in blocking complement and hence in the evasion of host defense. Structurally it is very similar to the human C4b-BP and the other members of complement control protein. Functionally it is most similar to the CR1 protein. VCP blocks both major pathways of complement activation. The crystal structure of VCP was determined a little over a year ago and it is the only known structure of an intact and complete complement control protein. In addition to binding complement, VCP also binds to heparin. These two binding abilities can take place simultaneously and contribute to its many function and to its potential use in several inflammatory diseases, e.g. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), CNS injury, xenotransplantation, etc. making it a truly fascinating molecule and potential drug.</p>

				<title>Lessons in Détente or know thy host: The immunomodulatory gene products of myxoma virus</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0273-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The poxvirus, myxoma virus, encodes within its genome at least eleven different proteins that compromise, skew, or disable the innate and adaptive responses of its hosts. In the laboratory rabbit, <i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>, these effects result in myxomatosis, a fatal condition characterized by skin lesions and systemic immunosuppression. Interestingly, while myxoma infection also causes skin lesions in its natural host and in natural populations of <i>O. cuniculus</i> in Australia where this novel host and the virus have co-evolved, the condition of myxomatosis does not ensue and infection is not fatal. In this review I discuss the biochemical properties of the characterized immunomodulatory proteins of myxoma virus, and their pathogenic effects in laboratory rabbits. Disruption of any one myxoma immunomodulatory gene diminishes the severity of the infection without compromising infectivity. Thus, the characterized immunomodulatory genes appear not to be required for a productive infection <i>in vivo</i>. The differences in the severity of their effects in laboratory-bred versus wild <i>O. cuniculus</i> suggest that the outcome of myxoma infection is a consequence of the interplay between the viral immunomodulatory gene products and the cells and molecules of the host immune system.</p>

				<title>The hepatitis C virus persistence: how to evade the immune system?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0287-0304</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an emerging virus of medical importance. A majority of HCV infections become chronic and lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV usually induces robust immune responses, but it frequently escapes the immune defense to establish persistent infection. The fact that HCV exists as an evolving quasispecies plays an important role in the selection of escape mutants. Furthermore, several viral proteins interfere with cellular functions, in particular, those involved in the immune response of the host. Several HCV proteins also modulate cell signalling through interaction with different effectors involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, or in the interferon-signalling pathway. In addition, HCV infects immune cells such as B and T cells, and thus affects their normal functions. These various strategies used by HCV to counter the immune response of the host are reviewed here. A better understanding of these mechanisms would help design new therapeutic targets.</p>

				<title>Variability or conservation of hepatitis C virus hypervariable region 1? Implications for immune responses</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0305-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of the E2 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly heterogeneous in its primary sequence and is responsible for significant inter- and intra-individual variation of the infecting virus, which may represent an important pathogenetic mechanism leading to immune escape and persistent infection. A binding site for neutralizing antibodies (Ab) has also been allegedly identified in this region. Prospective studies of serological responses to synthetic oligopeptides derived from naturally-occurring HVR1 sequences showed promiscuous recognition of HVR1 variants in most patients via binding to C-terminal amino acid residues with conserved physicochemical properties. Monoclonal antibodies generated by immunization of mice with peptides derived from natural HVR1 sequences were shown to recognize several HVR1 variants in line with evidence gathered from studies using human sera. In addition, selected mAbs were able to bind HVR1 in the context of a complete soluble form of the E2 glycoprotein, indicating recognition of correctly folded sequences, and were shown to specifically capture circulating and recombinant HCV particles, suggesting that HVR1 is expressed on intact virus particles and therefore potentially able to interact with cellular receptor(s). These findings suggest that it is possible to induce a broadly reactive clonal immune response to multiple HCV variants and that this mechanism could be used in principle to induce protective immunity for a large repertoire of HCV variants.</p>

				<title>Regulatory mechanisms of viral hepatitis B and C</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0311-0321</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Of all the hepatitis viruses, only the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cause chronic hepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we discuss how these two biologically diverse viruses use common pathways to induce oxidative stress and activation of key transcription factors, known to be involved in inflammatory processes in cells. Activation of NF-𝜅B and STAT-3 most likely contribute to the progression of viral infections to chronic hepatitis and liver oncogenesis associated with HBV and HCV infections. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of action of HBx and HCV NS5A proteins in inducing intracellular events associated with the viral infections.</p>

				<title>HIV-1 Nef control of cell signalling molecules: multiple strategies to promote virus replication</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0323-0335</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>HIV-1 has at its disposal numerous proteins encoded by its genome which provide the required arsenal to establish and maintain infection in its host for a considerable number of years. One of the most important and enigmatic of these proteins is Nef. The Nef protein of HIV-1 plays a fundamental role in the virus life cycle. This small protein of approximately 27 kDa is required for maximal virus replication and disease progression. The mechanisms by which it is able to act as a positive factor during virus replication is an area of intense research and although some controversy surrounds Nef much has been gauged as to how it functions. Its ability to modulate the expression of key cellular receptors important for cell activation and control signal transduction elements and events by interacting with numerous cellular kinases and signalling molecules, including members of the Src family kinases, leading to an effect on host cell function is likely to explain at least in part its role during infection and represents a finely tuned mechanism where this protein assists HIV-1 to control its host.</p>

				<page>0337-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aetiology of cervical cancer has been primarily attributed to human papillomaviruses (HPVs). These are characterized by the persistent expression of the two oncogenes, E6 and E7. Experimental studies show that <i>E6</i> and <i>E7</i> genes of the high risk HPVs deregulate key cell cycle controls. Recent work has uncovered new cellular partners for these proteins that throw light on many of the pathways and processes in which these viral proteins intervene. This review focuses on the regulation of host proteins by the viral oncoproteins and consequence of such interactions on cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.</p>

				<title>Host-pathogen interactions during apoptosis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0349-0358</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Host pathogen interaction results in a variety of responses, which include phagocytosis of the pathogen, release of cytokines, secretion of toxins, as well as production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies have shown that many pathogens exert control on the processes that regulate apoptosis in the host. The induction of apoptosis upon infection results from a complex interaction of parasite proteins with cellular host proteins. Abrogation of host cell apoptosis is often beneficial for the pathogen and results in a successful host invasion. However, in some cases, it has been shown that induction of apoptosis in the infected cells significantly imparts protection to the host from the pathogen. There is a strong correlation between apoptosis and the host protein translation machinery: the pathogen makes all possible efforts to modify this process so as to inhibit cell suicide and ensure that it can survive and, in some cases, establish latent infection. This review discusses the significance of various pathways/steps during virus-mediated modulation of host cell apoptosis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Firefly luciferase bioluminescence (FLB) is a highly sensitive and specific method for the analysis of adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP) in biological samples. Earlier attempts to modify the FLB test for enhanced sensitivity have been typically based on <i>in vitro</i> cell systems. This study reports an optimized FLB procedure for the analysis of ATP in small tissue samples. The results showed that the sensitivity of the FLB test can be enhanced several fold by using ultraturax homogenizer, perchloric acid extraction, neutralization of acid extract and its optimal dilution, before performing the assay reaction.</p>

				<title>The chemical bases of the various AIDS epidemics: recreational drugs, anti-viral chemotherapy and malnutrition</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0383-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In 1981 a new epidemic of about two-dozen heterogeneous diseases began to strike non-randomly growing numbers of male homosexuals and mostly male intravenous drug users in the US and Europe. Assuming immunodeficiency as the common denominator the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) termed the epidemic, AIDS, for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. From 1981–1984 leading researchers including those from the CDC proposed that recreational drug use was the cause of AIDS, because of exact correlations and of drug-specific diseases. However, in 1984 US government researchers proposed that a virus, now termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the cause of the non-random epidemics of the US and Europe but also of a new, sexually random epidemic in Africa. The virus-AIDS hypothesis was instantly accepted, but it is burdened with numerous paradoxes, none of which could be resolved by 2003: Why is there no HIV in most AIDS patients, only antibodies against it? Why would HIV take 10 years from infection to AIDS? Why is AIDS not self-limiting via antiviral immunity? Why is there no vaccine against AIDS? Why is AIDS in the US and Europe not random like other viral epidemics? Why did AIDS not rise and then decline exponentially owing to antiviral immunity like all other viral epidemics? Why is AIDS not contagious? Why would only HIV carriers get AIDS who use either recreational or anti-HIV drugs or are subject to malnutrition? Why is the mortality of HIV-antibody-positives treated with anti-HIV drugs 7–9%, but that of all (mostly untreated) HIV-positives globally is only 1.4%? Here we propose that AIDS is a collection of chemical epidemics, caused by recreational drugs, anti-HIV drugs, and malnutrition. According to this hypothesis AIDS is not contagious, not immunogenic, not treatable by vaccines or antiviral drugs, and HIV is just a passenger virus. The hypothesis explains why AIDS epidemics strike non-randomly if caused by drugs and randomly if caused by malnutrition, why they manifest in drug- and malnutrition-specific diseases, and why they are not self-limiting via anti-viral immunity. The hypothesis predicts AIDS prevention by adequate nutrition and abstaining from drugs, and even cures by treating AIDS diseases with proven medications.</p>

				<title>Regulation of activity of the yeast TATA-binding protein through intra-molecular interactions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0413-0421</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dimerization is proposed to be a regulatory mechanism for TATA-binding protein (TBP) activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The reversible dimer-monomer transition of TBP is influenced by the buffer conditions <i>in vitro</i>. Using <i>in vitro</i> chemical cross-linking, we found yeast TBP (yTBP) to be largely monomeric in the presence of the divalent cation Mg<sup>2+</sup>, even at high salt concentrations. Apparent molecular mass of yTBP at high salt with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, run through a gel filtration column, was close to that of monomeric yTBP. Lowering the monovalent ionic concentration in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, resulted in dimerization of TBP. Effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was seen at two different levels: at higher TBP concentrations, it suppressed the TBP dimerization and at lower TBP levels, it helped keep TBP monomers in active conformation (competent for binding TATA box), resulting in enhanced TBP-TATA complex formation in the presence of increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup>. At both the levels, activity of the full-length TBP in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was like that reported for the truncated C-terminal domain of TBP from which the N-terminus is removed. Therefore for full-length TBP, intra-molecular interactions can regulate its activity via a similar mechanism.</p>

				<title>The transcriptional activator GAL4-VP16 regulates the intra-molecular interactions of the TATA-binding protein</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0423-0436</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binding characteristics of yeast TATA-binding protein (yTBP) over five oligomers having different TATA variants and lacking a UAS<sub>GAL</sub>, showed that TATA-binding protein (TBP)-TATA complex gets stabilized in the presence of the acidic activator GAL4-VP16. Activator also greatly suppressed the non-specific TBP-DNA complex formation. The effects were more pronounced over weaker TATA boxes. Activator also reduced the TBP dimer levels both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting the dimer may be a direct target of transcriptional activators. The transcriptional activator facilitated the dimer to monomer transition and activated monomers further to help TBP bind even the weaker TATA boxes stably. The overall stimulatory effect of the GAL4-VP16 on the TBP-TATA complex formation resembles the known effects of removal of the N-terminus of TBP on its activity, suggesting that the activator directly targets the N-terminus of TBP and facilitates its binding to the TATA box.</p>

				<title>A comparative phylogenetic analysis of full-length <i>mariner</i> elements isolated from the Indian tasar silkmoth, <i>Antheraea mylitta</i> (Lepidoptera: saturniidae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0443-0453</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mariner like elements (MLEs) are widely distributed type II transposons with an open reading frame (ORF) for transposase. We studied comparative phylogenetic evolution and inverted terminal repeat (ITR) conservation of MLEs from Indian saturniid silkmoth, <i>Antheraea mylitta</i> with other full length MLEs submitted in the database. Full length elements from <i>A. mylitta</i> were inactive with multiple mutations. Many conserved amino acid blocks were identified after aligning transposase sequences. Mariner signature sequence, DD(34)D was almost invariable although a few new class of elements had different signatures. <i>A. mylitta</i> MLEs (<i>Anmmar</i>) get phylogenetically classified under cecropia subfamily and cluster closely with the elements from other Bombycoidea superfamily members implying vertical transmission from a common ancestor. ITR analysis showed a conserved sequence of AGGT(2-8N)ATAAGT for forward repeat and AGGT(2-8N)ATGAAAT for reverse repeat. These results and additional work may help us to understand the dynamics of MLE distribution in <i>A. mylitta</i> and construction of appropriate vectors for mariner mediated transgenics.</p>

				<page>0455-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The endosperm and embryo that constitute the filial tissues of rice caryopsis are isolated from the maternal tissues by the absence of any symplastic continuity. Nutrients are transported to the endosperm through a single ovular vascular trace present on the ventral side of the ovary. Initially solute enters through the chalaza into the nucellar projection and then into the endosperm. At later stages transport occurs through the nucellar epidermis, centripetally towards the endosperm. The cell walls of the nucellar epidermis are provided with rib-like thickenings. A comparison of grain-filling in C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> cereals suggests that rice has structural features allied to C<sub>3</sub> cereals, such as wheat, but with significant differences.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ultrastructural investigation of the root cells of <i>Allium sativum</i> L. exposed to three different concentrations of Cd (100 𝜇M, 1 mM and 10 mM) for 9 days was carried out. The results showed that Cd induced several significant ultrastructural changes – high vacuolization in cytoplasm, deposition of electron-dense material in vacuoles and nucleoli and increment of disintegrated organelles. Data from electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) revealed that Cd was localized in the electron-dense precipitates in the root cells treated with 10 mM Cd. High amounts of Cd were mainly accumulated in the vacuoles and nucleoli of cortical cells in differentiating and mature root tissues. The mechanisms of detoxification and tolerance of Cd are briefly explained.</p>

				<title>Sucrose mobilization in relation to essential oil biogenesis during palmarosa (<i>Cymbopogon martinii</i> Roxb. Wats. var. <i>motia</i>) inflorescence development</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0479-0487</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Palmarosa inflorescence with partially opened spikelets is biogenetically active to incorporate [U-<sup>14</sup>C]sucrose into essential oil. The percent distribution of <sup>14</sup>C-radioactivity incorporated into geranyl acetate was relatively higher as compared to that in geraniol, the major essential oil constituent of palmarosa. At the partially opened spikelet stage, more of the geraniol synthesized was acetylated to form geranyl acetate, suggesting that majority of the newly synthesized geraniol undergoes acetylation, thus producing more geranyl acetate. <i>In vitro</i> development of palmarosa inflorescence, fed with [U-<sup>14</sup>C]sucrose, resulted in a substantial reduction in percent label from geranyl acetate with a corresponding increase in free geraniol, thereby suggesting the role of an esterase in the production of geraniol from geranyl acetate. At time course measurement of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> incorporation into geraniol and geranyl acetate substantiated this observation. Soluble acid invertase was the major enzyme involved in the sucrose breakdown throughout the inflorescence development. The activities of cell wall bound acid invertase, alkaline invertase and sucrose synthase were relatively lower as compared to the soluble acid invertase. Sucrose to reducing sugars ratio decreased till fully opened spikelets stage, concomitant with increased acid invertase activity and higher metabolic activity. The phenomenon of essential oil biosynthesis has been discussed in relation to changes in these physiological parameters.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0489-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of density and kinship on growth and metamorphosis in tadpoles of <i>Rana temporalis</i> were studied in a 2 &#215; 4 factorial experiment. Fifteen egg masses were collected from streams in the Western Ghat region of south India. The tadpoles were raised as siblings or in groups of non-siblings at increasing density levels, viz. 15, 30, 60 and 120/5 l water. With an increase in density level from 15 to 120 tadpoles/5 l water, duration of the larval stage increased and fewer individuals metamorphosed irrespective of whether they belonged to sibling or non-sibling groups by day 100 when the experiments were terminated. The size of individuals at metamorphosis declined significantly with increase in the density of rearing. However, at higher densities (60 and 120 tadpoles/5 l water) sibling group tadpoles performed better compared to mixed groups and took significantly less time to metamorphose. Also, more individuals of sibling groups metamorphosed compared to non-sibling groups at a given density. Mixed rearing retarded growth rates, prolonged larval duration resulting in a wider spectrum of size classes, and lowered the number of individuals recruited to terrestrial life. The study shows that interference competition occurred more strongly in cohorts of mixed relatedness than in sibling groups.</p>

				<title>A technique for estimating maximum harvesting effort in a stochastic fishery model</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0497-0506</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Exploitation of biological resources and the harvest of population species are commonly practiced in fisheries, forestry and wild life management. Estimation of maximum harvesting effort has a great impact on the economics of fisheries and other bio-resources. The present paper deals with the problem of a bioeconomic fishery model under environmental variability. A technique for finding the maximum harvesting effort in fluctuating environment has been developed in a two-species competitive system, which shows that under realistic environmental variability the maximum harvesting effort is less than what is estimated in the deterministic model. This method also enables us to find out the safe regions in the parametric space for which the chance of extinction of the species is minimized. A real life fishery problem has been considered to obtain the inaccessible parameters of the system in a systematic way. Such studies may help resource managers to get an idea for controlling the system.</p>

				<title>Status of Austro-Asiatic groups in the peopling of India: An exploratory study based on the available prehistoric, linguistic and biological evidences</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0507-0522</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Among the most contentious currently debated issues is about the people who had settled first in the Indian subcontinent. It has been suggested that the communities affiliated to the Austro-Asiatic linguistic family are perhaps the first to settle in India and the palaeoanthropological evidences suggest the earliest settlement probably around 60,000 years BP. Recent speculations, based on both traditional genetic markers and DNA markers, seem to corroborate the aforesaid view. However, these studies are inadequate both in terms of the representation of the constituent groups within this broad linguistic category as well as the number of samples that represent each of them. We strongly feel that, before making any formidable conclusions on the peopling of India and/or the history of settlement, it is necessary to ascertain that the Austro-Asiatic speakers, represented by over 30 different tribal groups, either genetically constitute a homogenous single entity or are a heterogeneous conglomeration, derived from different sources. As a first step towards this we tried to collate and analyse the existing information – geographic, ethno-historic, cultural and biological.</p>
					<p>The results of the analyses of anthropometric and genetic marker data indicate that the Austro-Asiatic groups, particularly the Mundari speakers, with certain exceptions, show greater homogeneity among them when compared to the other linguistic groups, although certain groups show as outliers. However, traditional genetic markers show lower within population heterozygosity compared to Dravidian and other Indian populations. This is contrary to what has been claimed in case of certain DNA markers. Given that relatively greater heterozygosity among the Austro-Asiatic populations has been taken as one of the important evidences supporting greater antiquity of these populations one should await results of detailed DNA studies being currently undertaken by us, involving a number of Austro-Asiatic and other ethnic populations of India to resolve the issue unequivocally.</p>

				<title>On the origin of differentiation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0523-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Following the origin of multicellularity in many groups of primitive organisms there evolved more than one cell type. It has been assumed that this early differentiation is related to size – the larger the organism the more cell types. Here two very different kinds of organisms are considered: the volvocine algae that become multicellular by growth, and the cellular slime moulds that become multicellular by aggregation. In both cases there are species that have only one cell type and others that have two. It has been possible to show that there is a perfect correlation with size: the forms with two cell types are significantly larger than those with one. Also in both groups there are forms of intermediate size that will vary from one to two cell types depending on the size of the individuals, suggesting a form of quorum sensing. These observations reinforce the view that size plays a critical role in influencing the degree of differentiation.</p>

				<title>Non-Watson Crick base pairs might stabilize RNA structural motifs in ribozymes – A comparative study of group-I intron structures</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0547-0555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent decades studies on RNA structure and function have gained significance due to discoveries on diversified functions of RNA. A common element for RNA secondary structure formed by series of non-Watson/Watson Crick base pairs, internal loops and pseudoknots have been the highlighting feature of recent structural determination of RNAs. The recent crystal structure of group-I introns has demonstrated that these might constitute RNA structural motifs in ribozymes, playing a crucial role in their enzymatic activity. To understand the functional significance of these non-canonical base pairs in catalytic RNA, we analysed the sequences of group-I introns from nuclear genes. The results suggest that they might form the building blocks of folded RNA motifs which are crucial to the catalytic activity of the ribozyme. The conservation of these, as observed from divergent organisms, argues for the presence of non-canonical base pairs as an important requisite for the structure and enzymatic property of ribozymes by enabling them to carry out functions such as replication, polymerase activity etc. in primordial conditions in the absence of proteins.</p>

				<title>Mass distributions of a macromolecular assembly based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometric masses of the constituent subunits</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0557-0568</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Macromolecular assemblies containing multiple protein subunits and having masses in the megadalton (MDa) range are involved in most of the functions of a living cell. Because of variation in the number and masses of subunits, macromolecular assemblies do not have a unique mass, but rather a mass distribution. The giant extracelular erythrocruorins (Ers), &#8764; 3.5 MDa, comprized of at least 180 polypeptide chains, are one of the best characterized assemblies. Three-dimensional reconstructions from cryoelectron microscopic images show them to be hexagonal bilayer complexes of 12 subassemblies, each comprised of 12 globin chains, anchored to a subassembly of 36 nonglobin linker chains. We have calculated the most probable mass distributions for <i>Lumbricus</i> and <i>Riftia</i> assemblies and their globin and linker subassemblies, based on the <i>Lumbricus</i> Er stoichiometry and using accurate subunit masses obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The expected masses of <i>Lumbricus</i> and <i>Riftia</i> Ers are 3.517 MDa and 3.284 MDa, respectively, with a possible variation of &#8764; 9% due to the breadth of the mass distributions. The <i>Lumbricus</i> Er mass is in astonishingly good agreement with the mean of 23 known masses, 3.524 &#177; 0.481 MDa.</p>

				<title>Accuracy of marker-assisted selection with auxiliary traits</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0569-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic information on molecular markers is increasingly being used in plant and animal improvement programmes particularly as indirect means to improve a metric trait by selection either on an individual basis or on the basis of an index incorporating such information. This paper examines the utility of an index of selection that not only combines phenotypic and molecular information on the trait under improvement but also combines similar information on one or more auxiliary traits. The accuracy of such a selection procedure has been theoretically studied for sufficiently large populations so that the effects of detected quantitative trait loci can be perfectly estimated. The theory is illustrated numerically by considering one auxiliary trait. It is shown that the use of an auxiliary trait improves the selection accuracy; and, hence, the relative efficiency of index selection compared to individual selection which is based on the same intensity of selection. This is particularly so for higher magnitudes of residual genetic correlation and environmental correlation having opposite signs, lower values of the proportion of genetic variation in the main trait associated with the markers, negligible proportion of genetic variation in the auxiliary trait associated with the markers, and lower values of the heritability of the main trait but higher values of the heritability of the auxiliary trait.</p>

				<title>Biochemical basis of the high resistance to oxidative stress in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0581-0588</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerobic organisms experience oxidative stress due to generation of reactive oxygen species during normal aerobic metabolism. In addition, several chemicals also generate reactive oxygen species which induce oxidative stress. Thus oxidative stress constitutes a major threat to organisms living in aerobic environments. Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a physiological mechanism of cell death, that probably evolved with multicellularity, and is indispensable for normal growth and development. <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, an eukaryotic developmental model, shows both unicellular and multicellular forms in its life cycle and exhibits apparent caspase-independent programmed cell death, and also shows high resistance to oxidative stress. An attempt has been made to investigate the biochemical basis for high resistance of <i>D. discoideum</i> cell death induced by different oxidants. Dose-dependent induction of cell death by exogenous addition of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), <i>in situ</i> generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by hydroxylamine, and nitric oxide (NO) generation by sodium nitroprusside treatment in <i>D. discoideum</i> were studied. The AD<sub>50</sub> doses (concentration of the oxidants cusing 50% of the cells to die) after 24 h of treatment were found to be 0.45 mM, 4 mM and 1 mM, respectively. Studies on enzymatic antioxidant status of <i>D. discoideum</i> when subjected to oxidative stress, NO and nutrient stress reveal that superoxide dismutase and catalase were unchanged; a significant induction of glutathione peroxidase was observed. Interestingly, oxidative stress-induced lipid membrane peroxidative damage could not be detected. The results shed light on the biochemical basis for the observed high resistance to oxidative stress in <i>D. discoideum</i>.</p>

				<title>High genetic diversity in the coat protein and 3' untranslated regions among geographical isolates of <i>Cardamom mosaic virus</i> from south India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0589-0595</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A survey was conducted to study the biological and genetic diversity of <i>Cardamom mosaic virus</i> (CdMV) that causes the most widespread disease in the cardamom growing area in the Western Ghats of south India. Six distinct subgroups were derived based on their symptomatology and host range from the sixty isolates collected. The serological variability between the virus isolates was analysed by ELISA and Western blotting. The 3&#8242; terminal region consisting of the coat protein (CP) coding sequence and 3&#8242; untranslated region (3&#8242;UTR) was cloned and sequenced from seven isolates. Sequence comparisons revealed considerable genetic diversity among the isolates in their CP and 3&#8242;UTR, making CdMV one of the highly variable members of <i>Potyviridae</i>. The possible occurrence of recombination between the isolates and the movement of the virus in the cardamom tract of south India are discussed.</p>

				<title>Idiopathic cases of male infertility from a region in India show low incidence of Y-chromosome microdeletion</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0605-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chromosomal and Y-chromosomal microdeletion analysis has been done in cases of idiopathic infertility with the objective of evaluating the frequency of chromosomal and molecular anomaly as the causal factor of infertility. Barring a few cases of Klinefelter syndrome (XXY or XY/XXY mosaics), no chromosomal anomaly was encountered. Y-microdeletion was analysed by PCR-screening of STSs from different regions of the AZF (AZFa, AZFb, AZFc) on the long arm of the Y, as well as by using DNA probes of the genes RBM, DAZ (Yq), DAZLA (an autosomal homologue of DAZ) and SRY (Yp; sex determining gene). Out of 177 cases examined, 9 (azoospermia – 8 and oligoasthenospermia – 1) showed partial deletion of AZF. The size of deletion varied among patients but AZFc was either totally or partially removed in all of them. In contrast, no deletion was detected in AZFa. Testis biopsy done on a limited number of cases (50) showed diverse stages of spermatogenic arrest with no specific correlation with the genotype. The frequency of Y-chromosome microdeletion in our samples (&#8764; 5%) is much lower than the frequency (&#8764; 10%) reported globally and the two previous reports from India. We contend that the frequency may be affected by population structures in different geographical regions.</p>

				<title>Influence of continuous light and darkness on the secretory pinealocytes of <i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0613-0622</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In an earlier study on <i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i>, evidence of secretory activity in the pinealocytes had been demonstrated at the electron microscopic (EM) level and it was found to exist in two phases: a secretory phase (light cells) and a storage phase (dark cells). In the present investigation, <i>H. fossilis</i> was subjected to artificial photoperiods of continuous illumination and continuous darkness for a period of ten days and the effect on the secretory pinealocytes was studied at the EM level. Marked results were observed within the short period of ten days emphasizing the role of environmental photoperiod on the secretory activity of the pinealocytes. During continuous illuminated phase, both light and dark cells were observed: the light cells showed intense secretory activity and dark cells a storage one. During the dark phase both types of cells were present but in different metabolic states and neither of the cells demonstrated synthetic nor storage activity. Light cells were metabolically active but not secretory active and dark cells showed a necrotic condition. Phagocytotic activity of the dark cells was also seen. Intense neural activity was also observed during exposure to both the artificial photoperiods. The results highlight the role of light on the secretory activities of the pinealocytes of the catfish pineal organ.</p>

				<title>Stable propagation of `selfish' genetic elements</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0623-0636</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extrachromosomal or chromosomally integrated genetic elements are common among prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These elements exhibit a variety of `selfish’ strategies to ensure their replication and propagation during the growth of their host cells. To establish long-term persistence, they have to moderate the degree of selfishness so as not to imperil the fitness of their hosts. Earlier genetic and biochemical studies together with more recent cell biological investigations have revealed details of the partitioning mechanisms employed by low copy bacterial plasmids. At least some bacterial chromosomes also appear to rely on similar mechanisms for their own segregation. The 2 𝜇m plasmid of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and related yeast plasmids provide models for optimized eukaryotic selfish DNA elements. Selfish DNA elements exploit the genetic endowments of their hosts without imposing an undue metabolic burden on them. The partitioning systems of these plasmids appear to make use of a molecular trick by which the plasmids feed into the segregation pathway established for the host chromosomes.</p>

				<title>An overview of the non-mevalonate pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis in plants</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0637-0646</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Terpenoids are known to have many important biological and physiological functions. Some of them are also known for their pharmaceutical significance. In the late nineties after the discovery of a novel non-mevalonate (non-MVA) pathway, the whole concept of terpenoid biosynthesis has changed. In higher plants, the conventional acetate-mevalonate (Ac-MVA) pathway operates mainly in the cytoplasm and mitochondria and synthesizes sterols, sesquiterpenes and ubiquinones predominantly. The plastidic non-MVA pathway however synthesizes hemi-, mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenes, along with carotenoids and phytol chain of chlorophyll. In this paper, recent developments on terpenoids biosynthesis are reviewed with respect to the non-MVA pathway.</p>

				<title>The conservation of redundancy in genetic systems: effects of sexual and asexual reproduction</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0671-0681</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relationship between probability of survival and the number of deleterious mutations in the genome is investigated using three different models of highly redundant systems that interact with a threatening environment. Model one is a system that counters a potentially lethal infection; it has multiple identical components that act in sequence and in parallel. Model two has many different overlapping components that provide threefold coverage of a large number of vital functions. The third model is based on statistical decision theory: an ideal detector, following an optimum decision strategy, makes crucial decisions in an uncertain world. The probability of a fatal error is reduced by a redundant sampling system, but the chance of error rises as the system is impaired by deleterious mutations. In all three cases the survival profile shows a synergistic pattern in that the probability of survival falls slowly and then more rapidly. This is different than the multiplicative or independent survival profile that is often used in mathematical models. It is suggested that a synergistic profile is a property of redundant systems.</p>
					<p>Model one is then used to study the conservation of redundancy during sexual and asexual reproduction. A unicellular haploid organism reproducing asexually retains redundancy when the mutation rate is very low (0.001 per cell division), but tends to lose high levels of redundancy if the mutation rate is increased (0.01 to 0.1 per cell division). If a similar unicellular haploid organism has a sexual phase then redundancy is retained for mutation rates between 0.001 and 0.1 per cell division. The sexual organism outgrows the asexual organism when the above mutation rates apply. If they compete for finite resources the asexual organism will be extinguished. Variants of the sexual organism with increased redundancy will outgrow those with lower levels of redundancy and the sexual process facilitates the evolution of more complex forms. There is a limit to the extent that complexity can be increased by increasing the size of the genome and in asexual organisms this leads to progressive accumulation of mutations with loss of redundancy and eventual extinction. If complexity is increased by using genes in new combinations, the asexual form can reach a stable equilibrium, although it is associated with some loss of redundancy. The sexual form, by comparison, can survive, with retention of redundancy, even if the mutation rate is above one per generation.</p>
					<p>The conservation and evolution of redundancy, which is essential for complexity, depends on the sexual process of reproduction.</p>

				<title>Protein evolution: intrinsic preferences in peptide bond formation: a computational and experimental analysis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0683-0690</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two possibilities exist for the evolution of individual enzymes/proteins from a milieu of amino acids, one based on preference and selectivity and the other on the basis of random events. Logic is overwhelmingly in favour of the former. By protein data base analysis and experiments, we have provided data to show the manifestation of two types of preferences, namely, the choice of the neighbour and its acceptance from the amino end (left) or the carboxyl end (right). The study tends to show that if the 20 proteinous amino acids were made to combine in water, the resulting profile would be nonrandom. Such selectivity could be a factor in protein evolution.</p>

				<title>Calcium regulates the expression of a <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> asparaginyl tRNA synthetase gene</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0697-0707</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a screen for calcium-regulated gene expression during growth and development of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> we have identified an asparaginyl tRNA synthetase (<i>ddAsnRS</i>) gene, the second tRNA synthetase gene identified in this organism. The <i>ddAsnRS</i> gene shows many unique features. One, it is repressed by lowering cellular calcium, making it the first known calcium-regulated tRNA synthetase. Two, despite the calcium-dependence, its expression is unaltered during the cell cycle, making this the first <i>D. discoideum</i> gene to show a calcium-dependent but cell cycle phase-independent expression. Finally, the N-terminal domain of the predicted ddAsnRS protein shows higher sequence similarity to Glutaminyl tRNA synthetases than to other Asn tRNA synthetases. These unique features of the <i>AsnRS</i> from this primitive eukaryote not only point to a novel mechanism regulating the components of translation machinery and gene expression by calcium, but also hint at a link between the evolution of <i>GlnRS</i> and <i>AsnRS</i> in eukaryotes.</p>

				<title>Effect of pH, temperature and alcohols on the stability of glycosylated and deglycosylated stem bromelain</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0709-0714</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The biological significance of the carbohydrate moiety of a glycoprotein has been a matter of much speculation. In the present work, we have chosen stem bromelain from <i>Ananas comosus</i> as a model to investigate the role of glycosylation of proteins. Stem bromelain is a thiol protease which contains a single hetero-oligosaccharide unit per molecule. Here, the deglycosylated form of the enzyme was obtained by periodate oxidation. The differences in the glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of the glycoprotein have been studied at various temperatures and pH values, using probes such as loss of enzyme activity and by the changes in fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra. Deglycosylated bromelain showed decreased enzyme activity and perturbed fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra. In addition to this, a comparative study of their activities in different organic solvents showed a marked decrease in case of deglycosylated form of the enzyme. It is thus concluded that glycosylation contributes towards the functional stability of glycoenzymes.</p>

				<title>Curcumin-induced inhibition of cellular reactive oxygen species generation: Novel therapeutic implications</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0715-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is evidence for increased levels of circulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in diabetics, as indirectly inferred by the findings of increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant status. Direct measurements of intracellular generation of ROS using fluorescent dyes also demonstrate an association of oxidative stress with diabetes. Although phenolic compounds attenuate oxidative stress-related tissue damage, there are concerns over toxicity of synthetic phenolic antioxidants and this has considerably stimulated interest in investigating the role of natural phenolics in medicinal applications. Curcumin (the primary active principle in turmeric, <i>Curcuma longa</i> Linn.) has been claimed to represent a potential antioxidant and antiinflammatory agent with phytonutrient and bioprotective properties. However there are lack of molecular studies to demonstrate its cellular action and potential molecular targets. In this study the antioxidant effect of curcumin as a function of changes in cellular ROS generation was tested. Our results clearly demonstrate that curcumin abolished both phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA) and thapsigargin-induced ROS generation in cells from control and diabetic subjects. The pattern of these ROS inhibitory effects as a function of dose-dependency suggests that curcumin mechanistically interferes with protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium regulation. Simultaneous measurements of ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx suggest that a rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be a trigger for increased ROS generation. We suggest that the antioxidant and antiangeogenic actions of curcumin, as a mechanism of inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and PKC activity, should be further exploited to develop suitable and novel drugs for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and other diabetic complications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A novel tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (MTS) was used in the assessment of antimicrobial activity in earthworm in the presence of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) as an electron coupling reagent. This activity was purified from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECF), <i>Eisenia fetida andrei</i> (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae, annelids) using a series of column chromatography techniques and was tested against three Gram-negative strains of <i>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila</i> and three Gram-positive strains of <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus megaterium, Arthrobacter</i> sp., respectively. Only the pigment-free eluate of coelomic fluid of the earthworm (ECFPE) showed activity against <i>B. megaterium</i> amongst three isolated active fractions. The anion (DEAE-52) exchange effluent of the ECFPE was reported to have the strongest activity against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> amongst the three active fractions. The 20% acetonitrile eluate (AE) by Sep-Pak C<sub>18</sub> cartridge was also tested and showed fair resistance against <i>E. coli, P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp., respectively.</p>

				<title>Role of ureogenesis in tackling problems of ammonia toxicity during exposure to higher ambient ammonia in the air-breathing walking catfish <i>Clarias batrachus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0733-0742</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the possible role of ureogenesis to avoid the accumulation of toxic ammonia to a lethal level under hyper-ammonia stress was tested in the air-breathing walking catfish <i>Clarias batrachus</i> by exposing the fish at 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 7 days. Excretion of ammonia by the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-exposed fish was totally suppressed, which was accompanied by significant accumulation of ammonia in different body tissues. The walking catfish, which is otherwise predominantly ammoniotelic, turned totally towards ureotelism from ammoniotelism with a 5- to 6-fold increase of urea-N excretion during exposure to higher ambient ammonia. Stimulation of ureogenesis was accompanied with significant increase of some of the key urea cycle enzymes such as carbamyl phosphate synthetase (urea cycle-related), argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase both in hepatic and non-hepatic tissues. Due to this unique physiological strategy of turning towards ureotelism from ammoniotelism via the induced urea cycle, this air-breathing catfish is able to survive in very high ambient ammonia, which they face in certain seasons of the year in the natural habitat.</p>

				<title>Antennal sensilla of grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) in relation to food preferences and habits</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0743-0752</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The external structure, i.e. number and distribution of sensillae on male and female antennae of 12 species of grasshoppers belonging to Pamphaginae, Catantopinae, Oedipodinae and Gomphocerinae in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Five major types of antennal sensillae were detected – trichoid, long basiconic, short basiconic, slender and short basiconic, and coeloconic sensillae. Total number of antennal sensillae varied among different sexes, subfamilies, feeding groups, life forms and eco-forms. Males showed significantly more sensillae than females, due to presence of more short basiconic and coeloconic sensillae. Species under Catantopinae showed more long basiconic sensillae than the others. The Oedipodinae had the highest number of slender and short basiconic sensillae and coeloconic sensillae, followed by Catantopinae and Gomphocerinae; while Pamphaginae had the fewest. The total number of sensillae showed the same trend for these two types amongst the subfamilies as well, species which prefer habits on the ground possessed fewer antennal sensillae than species which prefer to stay on plants. The maximal number of antennal sensillae were observed in hygrophytous species, <i>Chorthippus albomarginatus</i>, in the 12 grasshopper species investigated, although the data is not statistically significant. The general trend which emerged was that species feeding on grass possessed more antennal sensillae, particularly coeloconic sensillae, compared to other feeding group species.</p>

				<title>Silk formation mechanisms in the larval salivary glands of <i>Apis mellifera</i> (Hymenoptera: Apidae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0753-0764</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanism of silk formation in <i>Apis mellifera</i> salivary glands, during the 5th instar, was studied. Larval salivary glands were dissected and prepared for light and polarized light microscopy, as well as for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that silk formation starts at the middle of the 5th instar and finishes at the end of the same instar. This process begins in the distal secretory portion of the gland, going towards the proximal secretory portion; and from the periphery to the center of the gland lumen. The silk proteins are released from the secretory cells as a homogeneous substance that polymerizes in the lumen to form compact birefringent tactoids. Secondly, the water absorption from the lumen secretion, carried out by secretory and duct cells, promotes aggregation of the tactoids that form a spiral-shape filament with a zigzag pattern. This pattern is also the results of the silk compression in the gland lumen and represents a high concentration of macromolecularly well-oriented silk proteins.</p>

				<title>Insights from stable light isotopes on enamel defects and weaning in Pliocene herbivores</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0765-0773</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A high prevalence of enamel hypoplasia in several herbivores from the early Pliocene Langebaanweg locality, South Africa, indicates general systemic stress during the growing years of life. The presence of several linear enamel hypoplasias per tooth crown in many teeth further suggest that these stress events may be episodic. The 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O values along tooth crowns of mandibular second molars of <i>Sivatherium hendeyi</i> (Artiodactyla, Giraffidae) were used to investigate the cause of the stress events in this tooth type. Results show that weaning in this fossil giraffid occurred at a similar ontogenetic age to that in extant giraffes, and that the observed enamel hypoplasia towards the base of this tooth type manifested post-weaning. Further, high-resolution oxygen isotope analyses across <i>S. hendeyi</i> third molars suggest that the entire development of defective tooth crowns occurred under conditions of increased aridity in which the cool, rainy part of the seasonal cycle was missing. The high prevalence of this defect in many herbivores suggests that climatic conditions were not favourable. This study reiterates the value of stable isotope analyses in determining both the behaviour of fossil animals and the environmental conditions that prevailed during tooth development.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Longevity and age at sexual maturity in an Italian population of <i>Rana latastei</i> were studied by skeletochronology performed on the phalanges. Frogs collected in 1998 and 1999 by drift fences and pitfall traps were marked by toe-clipping. After marking, individuals were released and the cut phalanges were processed for skeletochronological analysis. The maximum age so far recorded was 3 years in males and 4 years in females. The smallest male and female that were sexually mature on the basis of histological analysis of the gonads were 36 and 35 mm snout vent length (SVL), respectively. In both sexes, most individuals were estimated to breed shortly after emergence from their first overwintering. Among the European Brown Frogs, <i>Rana latastei</i> appears to be one of the shortest-lived and one of the first to reach sexual maturity.</p>

					<p>The major surface glycoprotein gp63 of the kinetoplastid protozoal parasite <i>Leishmania</i> is implicated as a ligand mediating uptake of the parasite into, and survival within, the host macrophage. By expressing gp63 antisense RNA from an episomal vector in <i>L. donovani</i> promastigotes, gp63-deficient transfectants were obtained. Reduction of the gp63 level resulted in increased generation times, altered cell morphology, accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and increased numbers of binucleate cells with one or two kinetoplasts. Growth was stimulated, and the number of binucleate cells reduced, by addition to the culture of a bacterially expressed fusion protein containing the fibronectin-like SRYD motif and the zinc-binding (metalloprotease) domain of gp63. These observations support an additional role of gp63 in promastigote multiplication; the fibronectin-like properties of gp63 may be important in this process.</p>

				<title>Dibutyryl c-AMP as an inducer of sporidia formation: Biochemical and antigenic changes during morphological differentiation of Karnal bunt (<i>Tilletia indica</i>) pathogen in axenic culture</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0023-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effect of dibutyryl adenosine 3&#8242;,5&#8242;-cyclic monophosphate (dbc-AMP), an analogue of c-AMP, was investigated on growth and morphological differentiation of <i>Tilletia indica</i>. Exponential growth was observed up to 21 days in both presence and absence of dbc-AMP; however, increasing concentration of dbc-AMP was deleterious to mycelial growth in liquid culture. A slow increase of mycelial biomass up to 21 days and decline at 30 days in the presence of 2.5 mM dbc-AMP was observed, therefore, this concentration was chosen in subsequent investigations. The inhibitory influence of dbc-AMP was further substantiated by decrease in soluble protein. The fungus on exposure to dbc-AMP experienced morphological differentiation from vegetative mycelial phase to sporogenous mycelial phase, and was induced to produce filiform sporidia. Use of quantitative ELISA further suggested that sporidia formation took more than 21 days in the presence of dbc-AMP. Variations of proteins during different stages of <i>T. indica</i> grown in the presence and absence of dbc-AMP suggested the expression of stage-specific proteins or differential expression of proteins induced by dbc-AMP. The changes in expression of cell surface antigens as evidenced from decrease and increase binding of anti-mycelial and anti-sporidial anti-bodies in dbc-AMP treated culture by ELISA was further interpreted on the basis of morphological differentiation from mycelial to sporidial phase.</p>

				<title>Identification of a hypothetical membrane protein interactor of ribosomal phosphoprotein P0</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0033-0043</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 of the human malarial parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (PfP0) has been identified as a protective surface protein. In <i>Drosophila</i>, P0 protein functions in the nucleus. The ribosomal function of P0 is mediated at the stalk of the large ribosomal subunit at the GTPase centre, where the elongation factor eEF2 binds. The multiple roles of the P0 protein presumably occur through interactions with other proteins. To identify such interacting protein domains, a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out. Out of a set of sixty clones isolated, twelve clones that interacted strongly with both PfP0 and the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> P0 (ScP0) protein were analysed. These belonged to three broad classes: namely</p>
					<ol>
						<li>ribosomal proteins;</li>
						<li>proteins involved in nucleotide binding; and</li>
						<li>hypothetical integral membrane proteins.</li>
					</ol> 
					<p>One of the strongest interactors (clone 67B) mapped to the gene YFL034W which codes for a hypothetical integral membrane protein, and is conserved amongst several eukaryotic organisms. The insert of clone 67B was expressed as a recombinant protein, and immunoprecipitaion (IP) reaction with anti-P0 antibodies pulled down this protein along with PfP0 as well as ScP0 protein. Using deletion constructions, the domain of ScP0, which interacted with clone 67B, was mapped to 60–148 amino acids. It is envisaged that the surface localization of P0 protein may be mediated through interactions with putative YFL034W-like proteins in <i>P. falciparum</i>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Qualitative and quantitative differences in proteins expressed in the middle silkglands of male and female silkworm larvae that differ in silk colour were investigated by high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE), followed by computer assisted image analysis. About 1000 protein spots were resolved in both the sexes and most proteins were shown to be distributed in the area from 15 kDa to 70 kDa and pH 4–8. It was found that some proteins displayed higher expression in yellow cocoon, while two proteins were only expressed in female silkworm silkgland tissue through the comparison and analysis by two-D software. These proteins especially existed in female silkworm middle silkgland tissue of yellow cocoon. Furthermore, these proteins might be involved in the expression of cocoon colour phenotype.</p>

				<title>Up-regulation of 𝜇-opioid receptors in the spinal cord of morphine-tolerant rats</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0051-0056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Though morphine remains the most powerful drug for treating pain, its effectiveness is limited by the development of tolerance and dependence. The mechanism underlying development of tolerance to morphine is still poorly understood. One of the factors could be an alteration in the number of m-receptors within specific parts of the nervous system. However, reports on changes in the 𝜇-opioid receptor density in the spinal cord after chronic morphine administration are conflicting. Most of the studies have used subcutaneously implanted morphine pellets to produce tolerance. However, it does not simulate clinical conditions, where it is more common to administer morphine at intervals, either by injections or orally. In the present study, rats were made tolerant to morphine by injecting increasing doses of morphine (10–50 mg/kg, subcutaneously) for five days. <i>In vitro</i> tissue autoradiography for localization of 𝜇-receptor in the spinal cord was done using [<sup>3</sup>H]-DAMGO. As compared to the spinal cord of control rats, the spinal cord of tolerant rats showed an 18.8% increase or up-regulation in the density of 𝜇-receptors in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. This up-regulation of 𝜇-receptors after morphine tolerance suggests that a fraction of the receptors have been rendered desensitized, which in turn could lead to tolerance.</p>

				<title>Analysis of human chorionic gonadotropin-monoclonal antibody interaction in BIAcore</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0057-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetic studies of macromolecular ligand-ligate interaction have generated ample interest since the advent of plasmon resonance based instruments like BIAcore. Most of the studies reported in literature assume a simple 1 : 1 Langmuir binding and complete reversibility of the system. However we observed that in a high affinity antigen-antibody system [human chorionic gonadotropin-monoclonal antibody (hCG-mAb)] dissociation is insignificant and the sensogram data cannot be used to measure the equilibrium and kinetic parameters. At low concentrations of mAb the complete sensogram could be fitted to a single exponential. Interestingly we found that at higher mAb concentrations, the binding data did not conform to a simple bimolecular model. Instead, the data fitted a two-step model, which may be because of surface heterogeneity of affinity sites. In this paper, we report on the global fit of the sensograms. We have developed a method by which a single two-minute sensogram can be used in high affinity systems to measure the association rate constant of the reaction and the functional capacity of the ligand (hCG) immobilized on the chip. We provide a rational explanation for the discrepancies generally observed in most of the BIAcore sensograms.</p>

				<title>Protective effects of sodium orthovanadate in diabetic reticulocytes and ageing red blood cells of Wistar rats</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0073-0079</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reticulocytes and the ageing red blood cells (RBCs) namely young (Y), middle-aged (M) and old RBCs (O) of female Wistar rats from different groups such as control animals (C), controls treated with vanadate (C + V), alloxan-induced diabetic (D), diabetic-treated with insulin (D + I) and vanadate (D + V), were fractionated on a percoll/BSA gradient. The following enzymes were measured – hexokinase (HK), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GSSG-R), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT), aspartate aminotransferase (AsAT) and arginase in the hemolysates of all the RBCs fractions. Decreases in the activity of HK and AsAT by about 70%, arginase and GSH-Px by 30% in old RBCs were observed in comparison to reticulocytes of control animals. Increases in the activity of GSSG-R by 86%, AlaAT by more than 400% and GST by 70% were observed in old RBCs in comparison to reticulocytes of control animals.</p>
					<p>Alloxan diabetic animals showed a further decrease in the activities of HK in Y RBCs by 37%, M RBCs by 39% and O RBCs by 32%, GSH-Px activity in Y RBCs by 13%, M RBCs by 20% and O RBCs by 33% and GST activity in Y RBCs by 14%, M RBCs by 42% and O RBCs by 60% in comparison to their corresponding cells of control animals. An increase in the activity of all the enzymes studied was also observed in reticulocytes of diabetic animals in comparison to reticulocytes of controls. The GSSG-R activity was found to be increased in Y RBCs by 49%, M RBCs by 67% and O RBCs by 64% as compared to the corresponding age-matched cells of control animals. The activity of arginase also decreased in Y RBCs by about10%, M RBCs by 20% and O RBCs by 30% in comparison to the age-matched cells of control animals. A decrease in the activity of AsAT in Y and M RBCs by 30%, and O RBCs by 25% was observed in diabetic animals in comparison to the age-matched cells of control animals. The activity of AlaAT was found to be decreased by more than 10% in Y and M RBCs and 25% in O RBCs of diabetic animals in comparison to the age-matched cells of control animals.</p>
					<p>Insulin administration to diabetic animals reversed the altered enzyme activity to control values. Vanadate treatment also reversed the enzyme levels except for that of GST in old cells.</p>

				<title>Effects of sodium-orthovanadate and <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i> seeds on hepatic and renal lipogenic enzymes and lipid profile during alloxan diabetes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0081-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sodium-orthovanadate (SOV) and seed powder of <i>Trigonella foenum graecum</i> Linn. (common name: fenugreek, family: Fabaceae) (TSP) besides being potential hypoglycemic agents have also been shown to ameliorate altered lipid metabolism during diabetes. This study evaluates the short-term effect of oral administration of SOV and TSP separately and in concert (for 21 days) on total lipid profile and lipogenic enzymes in tissues of alloxan diabetic rats. Diabetic rats showed 4-fold increase in blood glucose. The level of total lipids, triglycerides and total cholesterol in blood serum increased significantly during diabetes. During diabetes the level of total lipids increased significantly (𝑃 &#60; 0.001) in liver and in kidney by 48% and 55%, respectively, compared to control. Triglycerides level increased by 32% (𝑃 &#60; 0.01) in liver and by 51% (𝑃 &#60; 0.005) in kidney, respectively, compared to control. Total cholesterol level also increased significantly in both liver and kidney (𝑃  &#60; 0.01 and P &#60; 0.001, respectively). The activities of NADP-linked enzymes; namely glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malic enzyme (ME), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), and the activities of lipogenic enzymes namely ATP-citrate lyase (ATP-CL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were decreased significantly in liver and increased in kidney during diabetes as compared to control. SOV and TSP administration to diabetic animals prevented the development of hyperglycemia and alteration in lipid profile in plasma and tissues and maintained it near normal. Maximum prevention was observed in the combined treatment with lower dose of SOV (0.2%) after 21 days. We are presenting for the first time effectiveness of combined treatment of SOV and TSP in amelioration of altered lipid metabolism during experimental type-I diabetes.</p>

				<title>Golgi analysis of tangential neurons in the lobula plate of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0093-0104</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The lobula plate (LP), which is the third order optic neuropil of flies, houses wide-field neurons which are exquisitely sensitive to motion. Among Diptera, motion-sensitive neurons of larger flies have been studied at the anatomical and physiological levels. However, the neurons of <i>Drosophila</i> lobula plate are relatively less explored. As <i>Drosophila</i> permits a genetic analysis of neural functions, we have analysed the organization of lobula plate of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.</p>
					<p>Neurons belonging to eight anatomical classes have been observed in the present study. Three neurons of the horizontal system (HS) have been visualized. The HS north (HSN) neuron, occupying the dorsal lobula plate is stunted in its geometry compared to that of larger flies. Associated with the HS neurons, thinner horizontal elements known as h-cells have also been visualized in the present study. Five of the six known neurons of the vertical system (VS) have been visualized. Three additional neurons in the proximal LP comparable in anatomy to VS system have been stained. We have termed them as additional VS (AVS)-like neurons. Three thinner tangential cells that are comparable to VS neurons, which are elements of twin vertical system (tvs); and two cells with wide dendritic fields comparable to CH neurons of Diptera have been also observed. Neurons comparable to VS cells but with ‘tufted’ dendrites have been stained. The HSN and VS1-VS2 neurons are dorsally stunted. This is possibly due to the shape of the compound eye of <i>Drosophila</i> which is reduced in the fronto-dorsal region as compared to larger flies.</p>

				<title>Factors influencing offspring traits in the oviparous multi-clutched lizard, <i>Calotes versicolor</i> (Agamidae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0105-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The determinants of offspring size and number in the tropical oviparous multi-clutched lizard, <i>Calotes versicolor</i>, were examined using both univariate and multivariate (path) analyses. In <i>C. versicolor</i> maternal snout-vent length (SVL) and body condition influence clutch mass and clutch size but have no significant influence on offspring size. The positive effect of maternal SVL and body condition on offspring number is counterbalanced by a negative effect of breeding time on egg mass. In fact, breeding time directly influences the offspring body mass and condition through variation in the egg mass. There is a trade-off between offspring mass and condition with offspring number, and breeding time influences both. Offspring hatched from the eggs of early (May–June) or mid (July–August) breeding periods invariably show lower mass and condition than those hatched from the eggs of late breeding season (September–October). Yet, there is no variation in offspring SVL among early, mid and late clutches. Thus, in <i>C. versicolor</i> offspring SVL is optimized while body mass and condition are not optimized.</p>

				<title>Adaptive response and split-dose effect of radiation on the survival of mice</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0111-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although the importance of radiation-induced adaptive response has been recognized in human health, risk assessment and clinical application, the phenomenon has not been understood well in terms of survival of animals. To examine this aspect Swiss albino mice were irradiated with different doses (2–10 Gy) at 0.015 Gy/s dose rate and observed on a regular basis for 30 days. Since almost 50% lethality was seen with 8 Gy, it was selected as the challenging dose for further studies. Irradiation of mice with conditioning doses (0.25 or 0.5 Gy) and subsequent exposure to 8 Gy caused significant increase in the survival of mice compared to irradiated control. The splitting of challenging dose did not influence the efficiency of conditioning doses (0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy) to induce an adaptive response. However conditioning doses given in fractions (0.25 Gy + 0.25 Gy) or (0.5 Gy + 0.5 Gy) were able to modulate the response of challenging dose of 8 Gy. These results clearly showed the occurrence of adaptive response in terms of survival of animals. The conditioning dose given in small fractions seemed to be more effective. The findings have been discussed from a mechanistic point of view. The possible biological implications, potential medical benefits, uncertainties and controversies related to adaptive response have also been addressed.</p>

				<title>On the dependence of speciation rates on species abundance and characteristic population size</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0119-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The question of the potential importance for speciation of large/small population sizes remains open. We compare speciation rates in twelve major taxonomic groups that differ by twenty orders of magnitude in characteristic species abundance (global population number). It is observed that the twenty orders of magnitude’s difference in species abundances scales to less than two orders of magnitude’s difference in speciation rates. As far as species abundance largely determines the rate of generation of intraspecific endogenous genetic variation, the result obtained suggests that the latter rate is not a limiting factor for speciation. Furthermore, the observed approximate constancy of speciation rates in different taxa cannot be accounted for by assuming a neutral or nearly neutral molecular clock in subdivided populations. Neutral fixation is only relevant in sufficiently small populations with 4𝑁<sub>𝑒</sub> 𝜈 &#60; 1, which appears an unrealistic condition for many taxa of the smaller organisms. Further research is clearly needed to reveal the mechanisms that could equate the evolutionary pace in taxa with dramatically different population sizes.</p>

				<title>A novel potassium deficiency-induced stimulon in <i>Anabaena torulosa</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0153-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Potassium deficiency enhanced the synthesis of fifteen proteins in the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena torulosa</i> and of nine proteins in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. These were termed potassium deficiency-induced proteins or PDPs and constitute hitherto unknown potassium deficiency–induced stimulons. Potassium deficiency also enhanced the synthesis of certain osmotic stress-induced proteins. Addition of K<sup>+</sup> repressed the synthesis of a majority of the osmotic stress-induced proteins and of PDPs in these bacteria. These proteins contrast with the dinitrogenase reductase of <i>A. torulosa</i> and the glycine betaine-binding protein of <i>E. coli</i>, both of which were osmo-induced to a higher level in potassium-supplemented conditions. The data demonstrate the occurrence of novel potassium deficiency-induced stimulons and a wider role of K<sup>+</sup> in regulation of gene expression and stress responses in bacteria.</p>

				<title>Microbial acetate oxidation in horizontal rotating tubular bioreactor</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0169-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility of conducting a continuous aerobic bioprocess in a horizontal rotating tubular bioreactor (HRTB). Aerobic oxidation of acetate by the action of a mixed microbial culture was chosen as a model process. The microbial culture was not only grown in a suspension but also in the form of a biofilm on the interior surface of HRTB. Efficiency of the bioprocess was monitored by determination of the acetate concentration and chemical oxygen demand (COD). While acetate inlet concentration and feeding rate influenced efficiency of acetate oxidation, the bioreactor rotation speed did not influence the bioprocess dynamics significantly. Gradients of acetate concentration and pH along HRTB were more pronounced at lower feeding rates. Volumetric load of acetate was proved to be the most significant parameter. High volumetric loads (above 2 g acetate l<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>) gave poor acetate oxidation efficiency (only 17 to 50%). When the volumetric load was in the range of 0.60–1.75 g acetate l<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>, acetate oxidation efficiency was 50–75%. At lower volumetric loads (0.14–0.58 g acetate l<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>), complete acetate consumption was achieved. On the basis of the obtained results, it can be concluded that HRTB is suitable for conducting aerobic continuous bioprocesses.</p>

				<title>Effects of anisotonicity on pentose-phosphate pathway, oxidized glutathione release and t-butylhydroperoxide-induced oxidative stress in the perfused liver of air-breathing catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0179-0187</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both hypotonic exposure (185 mOsmol/l) and infusion of glutamine plus glycine (2 mmol/l each) along with the isotonic medium caused a significant increase of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> production from [1-<sup>14</sup>C]glucose by 110 and 70%, respectively, from the basal level of 18.4 &#177; 1.2 nmol/g liver/min from the perfused liver of <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Conversely, hypertonic exposure (345 mOsmol/l) caused significant decrease of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> production from [1-<sup>14</sup>C]glucose by 34%. <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> production from [6-<sup>14</sup>C]glucose was largely unaffected by anisotonicity. The steady-state release of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into bile was 1.18 &#177; 0.09 nmol/g liver/min, which was reduced significantly by 36% and 34%, respectively, during hypotonic exposure and amino acid-induced cell swelling, and increased by 34% during hypertonic exposure. The effects of anisotonicity on <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> production from [1-<sup>14</sup>C]glucose and biliary GSSG release were also observed in the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide (50 𝜇mol/l). The oxidative stress-induced cell injury, caused due to infusion of t-butylhydroperoxide, was measured as the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage into the effluent from the perfused liver; this was found to be affected by anisotonicity. Hypotonic exposure caused significant decrease of LDH release and hypertonic exposure caused significant increase of LDH release from the perfused liver. The data suggest that hypotonically-induced as well as amino acid-induced cell swelling stimulates flux through the pentose-phosphate pathway and decreases loss of GSSG under condition of mild oxidative stress; hypotonically swollen cells are less prone to hydroperoxide-induced LDH release than hypertonically shrunken cells, thus suggesting that cell swelling may exert beneficial effects during early stages of oxidative cell injury probably due to swelling-induced alterations in hepatic metabolism.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0189-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the central vocal control nuclei of the zebra finch was studied using enzyme histochemistry. AChE fibres and cells are intensely labelled in the forebrain nucleus area X, strongly labelled in high vocal centre (HVC) perikarya, and moderately to lightly labelled in the somata and neuropil of vocal control nuclei robust nucleus of arcopallium (RA), medial magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MMAN) and lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN). The identified sites of cholinergic and/or cholinoceptive neurons are similar to the cholinergic presence in vocal control regions of other songbirds such as the song sparrow, starling and another genus of the zebra finch (<i>Poephila guttata</i>), and to a certain extent in parallel vocal control regions in vocalizing birds such as the budgerigar. AChE presence in the vocal control system suggests innervation by either afferent projecting cholinergic systems and/or local circuit cholinergic neurons. Co-occurrence with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) indicates efferent cholinergic projections. The cholinergic presence in parts of the zebra finch vocal control system, such as the area X, that is also intricately wired with parts of the basal ganglia, the descending fibre tracts and brain stem nuclei could underlie this circuitry’s involvement in sensory processing and motor control of song.</p>

				<title>Foraging behaviour in tadpoles of the bronze frog <i>Rana temporalis</i>: Experimental evidence for the ideal free distribution</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0201-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ability of bronze frog <i>Rana temporalis</i> tadpoles (pure or mixed parental lines) to assess the profitability of food habitats and distribute themselves accordingly was tested experimentally using a rectangular choice tank with a non-continuous input design. Food (boiled spinach) was placed at two opposite ends of the choice tank in a desired ratio (1 : 1, 1 : 2 or 1 : 4) to create habitat A and B. The tadpoles in Gosner stage 28–33, pre-starved for 24 h, were introduced in an open ended mesh cylinder placed in the center of the choice tank, held for 4 min (for acclimation) and then released to allow free movement and habitat selection. The number of tadpoles foraging at each habitat was recorded at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min time intervals. The actual suitability, 𝑆<sub>𝑖</sub> (the food available in a habitat after colonization of tadpoles) of each habitat was obtained from the equation 𝑆<sub>𝑖</sub> = 𝐵<sub>𝑖</sub> - 𝑓<sub>𝑖</sub> (𝑑<sub>𝑖</sub>) where 𝐵<sub>𝑖</sub> is basic suitability (amount of food provided at each habitat before release of tadpoles), 𝑓<sub>𝑖</sub> is the rate of depletion of food (lowering effect) with introduction of each tadpole, and 𝑑<sub>𝑖</sub> is the density of tadpoles in habitat 𝑖. The expected number of tadpoles at each habitat was derived from the actual suitability. With no food in the choice tank, movement of the tadpoles in the test arena was random indicating no bias towards any end of the choice tank or the procedure. In tests with a 1 : 1 food ratio, the observed ratio of tadpoles (11.71 : 12.28) was comparable with the expected 12 : 12 ratio. The observed number of tadpoles in the habitats with a 1 : 2 food ratio was 8.71 : 15.29 and 7.87 : 16.13 for pure and mixed parental lines respectively. In both cases, the observed ratios were close to the expected values (7 : 17). Likewise, in experiments with a 1 : 4 food ratio, the observed number of tadpoles in the two habitats (10.78 : 37.22) did not differ significantly from the expected ratio of 7 : 41. In all tests, the number of <i>R. temporalis</i> tadpoles matched ideally with habitat profitability (undermatching index 𝐾 ≅ 1). The study shows that tadpoles of the bronze frog exhibit an ideal free distribution while foraging regardless of whether they are siblings or non-siblings in a group, which correlates well with their group living strategy in nature.</p>

				<title>Enhanced functional and structural domain assignments using remote similarity detection procedures for proteins encoded in the genome of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> H37Rv</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0245-0259</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sequencing of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) H37Rv genome has facilitated deeper insights into the biology of MTB, yet the functions of many MTB proteins are unknown. We have used sensitive profile-based search procedures to assign functional and structural domains to infer functions of gene products encoded in MTB. These domain assignments have been made using a compendium of sequence and structural domain families. Functions are predicted for 78% of the encoded gene products. For 69% of these, functions can be inferred by domain assignments. The functions for the rest are deduced from their homology to proteins of known function. Superfamily relationships between families of unknown and known structures have increased structural information by &#8764; 11%. Remote similarity detection methods have enabled domain assignments for 1325 ‘hypothetical proteins’. The most populated families in MTB are involved in lipid metabolism, entry and survival of the bacillus in host. Interestingly, for 353 proteins, which we refer to as MTB-specific, no homologues have been identified. Numerous, previously unannotated, hypothetical proteins have been assigned domains and some of these could perhaps be the possible chemotherapeutic targets. MTB-specific proteins might include factors responsible for virulence. Importantly, these assignments could be valuable for experimental endeavors. The detailed results are publicly available at http://hodgkin.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/&#8764;dots.</p>

				<title>When proteome meets genome: the alpha helix and the beta strand of proteins are eschewed by mRNA splice junctions and may define the minimal indivisible modules of protein architecture</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0261-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The significance of the intron-exon structure of genes is a mystery. As eukaryotic proteins are made up of modular functional domains, each exon was suspected to encode some form of module; however, the definition of a module remained vague. Comparison of pre-mRNA splice junctions with the three-dimensional architecture of its protein product from different eukaryotes revealed that the junctions were far less likely to occur inside the 𝛼-helices and 𝛽-strands of proteins than within the more flexible linker regions (‘turns’ and ‘loops’) connecting them. The splice junctions were equally distributed in the different types of linkers and throughout the linker sequence, although a slight preference for the central region of the linker was observed. The avoidance of the 𝛼-helix and the 𝛽-strand by splice junctions suggests the existence of a selection pressure against their disruption, perhaps underscoring the investment made by nature in building these intricate secondary structures. A corollary is that the helix and the strand are the smallest integral architectural units of a protein and represent the minimal modules in the evolution of protein structure. These results should find use in comparative genomics, designing of cloning strategies, and in the mutual verification of genome sequences with protein structures.</p>

				<title>An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for the differentiation of members of the <i>Anopheles culicifacies</i> complex</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0275-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Anopheles culicifacies</i>, the principal vector of malaria in India, is a complex of five cryptic species which are morphologically indistinguishable at any stage of life. In view of the practical difficulties associated with classical cytotaxonomic method for the identification of members of the complex, an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) assay targeted to the D3 domain of 28S ribosomal DNA was developed. The assay discriminates <i>An. culicifacies</i> species A and D from species B, C and E. The assay was validated using chromosomally-identified specimens of <i>An. culicifacies</i> from different geographical regions of India representing different sympatric associations. The assay correctly differentiates species A and D from species B, C and E. The possible use of this diagnostic assay in disease vector control programmes is discussed.</p>

				<title>Protoporphyrin IX-induced structural and functional changes in human red blood cells, haemoglobin and myoglobin</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0281-0291</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protoporphyrin IX and its derivatives are used as photosensitizers in the photodynamic therapy of cancer. Protoporphyrin IX penetrates into human red blood cells and releases oxygen from them. This leads to a change in the morphology of the cells. Spectrophotometric studies reveal that protoporphyrin IX interacts with haemoglobin and myoglobin forming ground state complexes. For both proteins, the binding affinity constant decreases, while the possible number of binding sites increases, as the aggregation state of the porphyrin is increased. The interactions lead to conformational changes of both haemoglobin and myoglobin as observed in circular dichroism studies. Upon binding with the proteins, protoporphyrin IX releases the heme-bound oxygen from the oxyproteins, which is dependent on the stoichiometric ratios of the porphyrin: protein. The peroxidase activities of haemoglobin and myoglobin are potentiated by the protein-porphyrin complexation. Possible mechanisms underlying the relation between the porphyrin-induced structural modifications of the heme proteins and alterations in their functional properties have been discussed. The findings may have a role in establishing efficacy of therapeutic uses of porphyrins as well as in elucidating their mechanisms of action as therapeutic agents.</p>

				<title>Can mushrooms fix atmospheric nitrogen?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0293-0296</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is generally reported that fungi like <i>Pleurotus</i> spp. can fix nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). The way they do it is still not clear. The present study hypothesized that only associations of fungi and diazotrophs can fix N<sub>2</sub>. This was tested <i>in vitro</i>. <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> was inoculated with a bradyrhizobial strain nodulating soybean and <i>P. ostreatus</i> with no inoculation was maintained as a control. At maximum mycelial colonization by the bradyrhizobial strain and biofilm formation, the cultures were subjected to acetylene reduction assay (ARA). Another set of the cultures was evaluated for growth and nitrogen accumulation. Nitrogenase activity was present in the biofilm, but not when the fungus or the bradyrhizobial strain was alone. A significant reduction in mycelial dry weight and a significant increase in nitrogen concentration were observed in the inoculated cultures compared to the controls. The mycelial weight reduction could be attributed to C transfer from the fungus to the bradyrhizobial strain, because of high C cost of biological N<sub>2</sub> fixation. This needs further investigations using <sup>14</sup>C isotopic tracers. It is clear from the present study that mushrooms alone cannot fix atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>. But when they are in association with diazotrophs, nitrogenase activity is detected because of the diazotrophic N<sub>2</sub> fixation. It is not the fungus that fixes N<sub>2</sub> as reported earlier. Effective N<sub>2</sub> fixing systems, such as the present one, may be used to increase protein content of mushrooms. Our study has implications for future identification of as yet unidentified N<sub>2</sub> systems occurring in the environment.</p>

				<title>Infectivity analysis of two variable DNA B components of <i>Mungbean yellow mosaic virus-Vigna</i> in <i>Vigna mungo and Vigna radiata</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0297-0308</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Mungbean yellow mosaic virus-Vigna</i> (MYMV-Vig), a <i>Begomovirus</i> that causes yellow mosaic disease, was cloned from field-infected blackgram (<i>Vigna mungo</i>). One DNA A clone (KA30) and five different DNA B clones (KA21, KA22, KA27, KA28 and KA34) were obtained. The sequence identity in the 150-nt common region (CR) between DNA A and DNA B was highest (95%) for KA22 DNA B and lowest (85.6%) for KA27 DNA B. The Rep-binding domain had three complete 11-nt (5&#8242;-TGTATCGGTGT-3&#8242;) iterons in KA22 DNA B (and KA21, KA28 and KA34), while the first iteron in KA27 DNA B (5&#8242;-ATCGGTGT-3&#8242;) had a 3-nt deletion. KA27 DNA B, which exhibited 93.9% CR sequence identity to the mungbean-infecting MYMV, also shared the 3-nt deletion in the first iteron besides having an 18-nt insertion between the third iteron and the conserved nonanucleotide. MYMV was found to be closely related to KA27 DNA B in amino acid sequence identity of BV1 (94.1%) and BC1 (97.6%) proteins and in the organization of nuclear localization signal (NLS), nuclear export signal (NES) and phosphorylation sites. Agroinoculation of blackgram (<i>V. mungo</i>) and mungbean (<i>V. radiata</i>) with partial dimers of KA27 and KA22 DNA Bs along with DNA A caused distinctly different symptoms. KA22 DNA B caused more intense yellow mosaic symptoms with high viral DNA titre in blackgram. In contrast, KA27 DNA B caused more intense yellow mosaic symptoms with high viral DNA titre in mungbean. Thus, DNA B of MYMV-Vig is an important determinant of host-range between <i>V. mungo</i> and <i>V. radiata</i>.</p>

				<page>0309-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The host range specificity of <i>Agrobacterium</i> with five tea cultivars and an unrelated species (<i>Artemisia parviflora</i>) having extreme surface characteristics was evaluated in the present study. The degree of <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection in the five cultivars of tea was affected by leaf wetness, micro-morphology and surface chemistry. Wettable leaf surfaces of TV1, Upasi-9 and <i>Kangra jat</i> showed higher rate (75%) of <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection compared to Upasi-10 and ST-449, whereas non-wettable leaves of <i>A. parviflora</i> showed minimum (25%) infection. This indicated that the leaves with glabrous surface having lower 𝜃 (larger surface area covered by water droplet), higher phenol and wax content were more suitable for <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection. Caffeine fraction of tea promoted <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection even in leaves poor in wax (Upasi-10), whereas caffeine-free wax inhibited both <i>Agrobacterium</i> growth and infection. Thus, study suggests the importance of leaf surface features in influencing the <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection in tea leaf explants. Our study also provides a basis for the screening of a clone/cultivar of a particular species most suitable for <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection the first step in <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated genetic transformation.</p>

				<title>Genetic diversity amongst landraces of a dioecious vegetatively propagated plant, betelvine (<i>Piper betle</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0319-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Betelvine (<i>Piper betle</i> L., family Piperaceae) is an important, traditional and widely cultivated crop of India. The cultivators and consumers recognize more than 100 cultivars (landraces) based on regional and organoleptic considerations, while in terms of phytochemical constituents only five groups have been identified for all the landraces. Since betelvine is an obligate vegetatively propagated species, genomic changes, if any, may have become ‘fixed’ in the landraces. We carried out random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis in several landraces considered in four groups, namely, ‘<i>Kapoori</i>’, ‘<i>Bangla</i>’, ‘<i>Sanchi</i>’ and ‘<i>Others</i>’ in order to ascertain their genetic diversity. On the basis of the data from eleven RAPD primers, we distinguished genetic variation within and among the four groups of landraces. The results indicate the ‘<i>Kapoori</i>’ group is the most diverse. The neighbour joining (NJ) tree after a bootstrap (500 replicate) test of robustness clearly shows the four groups to be well separated. Interestingly, all known male or female betelvine landraces have separated in the NJ tree indicating an apparent gender-based distinction among the betelvines.</p>

				<title>Subcellular localization of cadmium in the root cells of <i>Allium cepa</i> by electron energy loss spectroscopy and cytochemistry</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0329-0335</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ultrastructural investigation of the root cells of <i>Allium cepa</i> L. exposed to 1 mM and 10 mM cadmium (Cd) for 48 and 72 h was carried out. The results indicated that Cd induced several obvious ultrastructural changes such as increased vacuolation, condensed cytoplasm with increased density of the matrix, reduction of mitochondrial cristae, severe plasmolysis and highly condensed nuclear chromatin. Electron dense granules appeared between the cell wall and plasmalemma. In vacuoles, electron dense granules encircled by the membrane were aggregated and formed into larger precipitates, which increase in number and volume as a consequence of excessive Cd exposure. Data from electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed that these granules contained Cd and showed that significantly higher level of Cd in vacuoles existed in the vacuolar precipitates of meristematic or cortical parenchyma cells of the differentiating and mature roots treated with 1 mM and 10 mM Cd. High levels of Cd were also observed in the crowded electron dense granules of nucleoli. However, no Cd was found in cell walls or in cells of the vascular cylinder. A positive Gomori-Swift reaction showed that small metallic silver grains were abundantly localized in the vesicles, which were distributed in the cytoplasm along the cell wall.</p>

				<title>Cell volume changes affect gluconeogenesis in the perfused liver of the catfish <i>Clarias batrachus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0337-0347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In addition to lactate and pyruvate, some amino acids were found to serve as potential gluconeogenic substrates in the perfused liver of <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Glutamate was found to be the most effective substrate, followed by lactate, pyruvate, serine, ornithine, proline, glutamine, glycine, and aspartate. Four gluconeogenic enzymes, namely phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) could be detected mainly in liver and kidney, suggesting that the latter are the two major organs responsible for gluconeogenic activity in this fish. Hypo-osmotically induced cell swelling caused a significant decrease of gluconeogenic efflux accompanied with significant decrease of activities of PEPCK, FBPase and G6Pase enzymes in the perfused liver. Opposing effects were seen in response to hyper-osmotically induced cell shrinkage. These changes were partly blocked in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that the aniso-osmotic regulations of gluconeogenesis possibly occurs through an inverse regulation of enzyme proteins and/or a regulatory protein synthesis in this catfish. In conclusion, gluconeogenesis appears to play a vital role in <i>C. batrachus</i> in maintaining glucose homeostasis, which is influenced by cell volume changes possibly for proper energy supply under osmotic stress.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ontogeny of photosensitivity has been studied in a holometabolous insect, the midge <i>Chironomus ramosus</i>. The life cycle of midges shifts from an aquatic environment to a non-aquatic environment. Extracellular electrical activity of photoreceptor organs was recorded at larval and adult stages. We found an increase in photosensitivity as the larva metamorphosed to the adult stage. This is the first report of changes in photosensitivity during the development of any insect described in an ecological context.</p>

				<title>mRNA translation during oocyte maturation plays a key role in development of primordial germ cells in <i>Xenopus embryos</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0355-0358</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is believed that cytoplasmic localization in the egg is necessary for development of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. In this study, we sought to determine if translation of maternal mRNA during oocyte maturation is involved in the development of PGCs. Donor oocytes were collected from both stimulated (those who receive gonadotropin) and unstimulated females, artificially matured and fertilized using a host transfer technique. Using chloramphenicol (50 𝜇M and 500 𝜇M RNA), RNA translation was inhibited during oocyte maturation. Our results showed that in unstimulated embryos treated with 50 𝜇M chloramphenicol, there was a significant reduction in the number of PGCs reaching genital ridges. In stimulated embryos, however, the number of PGCs was unchanged unless a higher concentration (500 𝜇M) of chloramphenicol was used. From these results it is suggested that maternal mRNA translation during oocyte maturation plays a key role in development of PGCs.</p>

				<title>Sexual selection, redundancy and survival of the most beautiful</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0359-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A model is described of a highly redundant complex organism that has overlapping banks of genes such that each vital function is specified by several different genetic systems. This generates a synergistic profile linking probability of survival to the number of deleterious mutations in the genome. Computer models show that there is a dynamic interaction between the mean number of new deleterious mutations per generation (𝑋), the mean number of deleterious mutations in the genome of the population (𝑌) and percentage zygote survival (Zs). Increased 𝑋 leads to increased 𝑌 and a fall in Zs but it takes several generations before a new equilibrium is reached. If sexual attraction is influenced by the number of deleterious mutations in the genome of individuals then 𝑌 is reduced and Zs increased for any given value of 𝑋. This fall in 𝑌 and rise in Zs is more marked in polygamous than monogamous mating systems. The model is specified such that deleterious mutations can occur without any observable or measurable effect on function. Thus sexual selection, in this organism, for low levels of deleterious mutations cannot be based on assessment of performance. Instead it is based on a simple symmetrical surface pattern that is flawlessly reproduced by organisms with no deleterious mutations, but is less than perfect, and therefore less attractive, if genetic systems have been deleted. A complex vital task requires a system with a high level of redundancy that acts so that the loss of one component has no observable effect and therefore cannot be used for sexual selection. The reproduction of a beautiful surface pattern also requires a low error, high redundancy genetic system; however, in this case there is advantage if a single deleterious mutation produces a recognisable change. This leads to the conclusion that sexual selection and sexual attraction should be based on beauty rather than utility, and explains the common observation in nature that it is the most beautiful that survive.</p>

				<title>Living in a physical world</title>
				<feature>Series</feature>
				<page>0391-0397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The diversity of life on earth dazzles all of us – the rich profusion of its designs, the wide size range of its organisms, the complexities of its hierarchical levels, and so forth. Undaunted, we life scientists seek broadly applicable rules, common patterns of organizations, and order beneath the perceptual chaos; we look for alternatives to the easy answers of revealed truth.</p>
					<p>Biology, no less than the physical sciences, treads this bumpy path – indeed the overt diversity of life puts especially bad bumps in its way. Perhaps its special difficulty underlies the gradual estrangement of biology from the more obviously successful physics of the post-Newtonian era and its awkward reintegration into the larger world of science in the twentieth century. That process remains incomplete; blame, if leveled, rests on the untidiness and distinctiveness of the subject. The tidy formulas of Newtonian physics work even less well for us than they do for, say, practicing engineers. Life directs its chemistry with sets of governing molecules and carries it out with the aid of catalysts of breathtaking specificity. And biology enjoys a strange organizing principle, evolution by natural selection, barely hinted at elsewhere in science.</p>
					<p>No aspect of this reintegration has been (and continues to be) more successful than what we have come to call molecular biology – a statement at once fashionable and incontrovertible, one with which I have no grounds to take issue. What matters here, indeed the entire justification for the essays that begin with the one here, comes down to the following. The very success of this chemically-reductionist biology too easily diverts us from other conjunctions of physical science and biology.</p>
					<p>This series will explore aspects of biology that reflect the physical world in which organisms find themselves. Evolution can do wonders, but it cannot escape its earthy context – a certain temperature range, a particular gravitational acceleration, the physical properties of air and water, and so forth. Nor can it tamper with mathematics. The baseline they provide both imposes constraints and affords opportunities. I mean to explore both.</p>
					<p>And I will take what other biologists might find an unfamiliar approach – one, by the way, that I have found productive enough to recommend. Instead of asking about the physical science behind a specific biological system, I will consider aspects of the physical world and ask what organisms, any organisms, make of each, both how they might capitalize on them and be in some fashion limited by them. In effect, this will be a search for commonalities and patterns, the only unusual feature being the physical rather than biochemical or phylogenetic bases. If this approach to science were a dart game, I would be thrown out – for throwing darts at a wall first and only subsequently painting targets around the points of impact.</p>
					<p>The series will concern itself mainly (but not exclusively) with organisms rather than ecosystems or organelles. It will follow the author’s bias and personal experience toward mechanical matters, doing less than equal justice to radiations and electrical phenomena. It will be speculative, opinionated, and idiosyncratic, aiming to stimulate thought and perhaps even investigation, to open doors rather than just describing them.</p>
					<p>When I began to do science, over forty years ago, I wondered first whether and then where I would get ideas worth pursuing. Now, on the cusp of retirement, I wonder what I am going to do with my accumulated headand notebooks-full of questions. Maybe we need something like a patent expiration date – if one does nothing with a hypothesis for some number of years, it should somehow revert to the public domain. I am not an unequivocal advocate of a strict rule, inasmuch as I have, on occasion, resurrected one of my old ideas, applying some additional insight or new tool in my experimental armamentarium – or just responding to a renewed interest. Still, these essays should, if nothing else, provide an opportunity to air untested ideas with some hope that others might care to pursue them.</p>

				<title>Isolation and characterization of a new mannose-binding lectin gene from <i>Taxus media</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0399-0407</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of the first mannose-binding lectin gene from a gymnosperm plant species, <i>Taxus media</i>. The full-length cDNA of <i>T. media</i> agglutinin (TMA) consisted of 676 bp and contained a 432 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 144 amino acid protein. Comparative analysis showed that TMA had high homology with many previously reported plant mannose-binding lectins and that <i>tma</i> encoded a precursor lectin with a 26-aa signal peptide. Molecular modelling revealed that TMA was a new mannose-binding lectin with three typical mannose-binding boxes like lectins from species of angiosperms. Tissue expression pattern analyses revealed that <i>tma</i> is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in leaves and stems, but not in fruits and roots. Phylogenetic tree analyses showed that TMA belonged to the structurally and evolutionarily closely related monocot mannose-binding lectin superfamily. This study provides useful information to understand the molecular evolution of plant lectins.</p>

				<title>Bioefficacy and mode-of-action of some limonoids of salannin group from <i>Azadirachta indica</i> A. Juss and their role in a multicomponent system against lepidopteran larvae</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0409-0416</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biological activities of the salannin type of limonoids isolated from <i>Azadirachta indica</i> A. Juss were assessed using the gram pod borer <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> (Hubner) and the tobacco armyworm <i>Spodoptera litura</i> (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Inhibition of larval growth was concomitant with reduced feeding by neonate and third instar larvae. All three compounds exhibited strong antifeedant activity in a choice leaf disc bioassay with 2.0, 2.3 and 2.8 𝜇g/cm<sup>2</sup> of 3-O-acetyl salannol, salannol and salannin, respectively deterring feeding by 50% in <i>S. litura</i> larvae. In nutritional assays, all three compounds reduced growth and consumption when fed to larvae without any effect on efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), suggesting antifeedant activity alone. No toxicity was observed nor was there any significant affect on nutritional indices following topical application, further suggesting specific action as feeding deterrents. When relative growth rates were plotted against relative consumption rates, growth efficiency of the <i>H. armigera</i> fed diet containing 3-O-acetyl salannol, salannol or salannin did not differ from that of starved control larvae (used as calibration curve), further confirming the specific antifeedant action of salannin type of limonoids. Where the three compounds were co-administered, no enhancement in activity was observed. Non-azadirachtin limonoids having structural similarities and explicitly similar modes of action, like feeding deterrence in the present case, have no potentiating effect in any combination.</p>

				<title>Effects of hypervitaminosis of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> on silkworm biology</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0417-0422</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A high-dose of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> in silkworm diet interrupts larval feeding and normal growth. High mortality of larvae occurs during molting and they cannot complete this process normally. Also the larvae exhibit nicotinamide hypervitaminosis symptoms such as immobility, dyspepsia, darkening of the skin, inability to excrete normally, exerting brownish fluid from anus and swelling of rectal muscles. Maximum larval weights in 1, 2 and 3 g/l treatments were 2.9, 1.6 and 1.2 g respectively, while maximum larval weight in the control was 5.6 g. Larval stage compared to control had increased 18, 26 and 31 days respectively. The concentration increase of uric acid in haemolymph demonstrates the hyperuricemia, while other measured biochemical compounds show significant decrease; sodium and potassium did not change significantly.</p>

				<title>Maxillary palp glomeruli and ipsilateral projections in the antennal lobe of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0423-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The antennal lobe was examined by Golgi-silver impregnation to differentiate the glomeruli depending on the source and types of inputs. Thirty-five of the 43 ‘identified’ olfactory glomeruli were Golgi-silver impregnated in the present study. Seven glomeruli compared to three, reported previously, were found to be targets of maxillary palp chemosensory neurons. These include glomeruli VA3, VC2, VM5, VA7m/VA7l of the ventral antennal lobe and DC2, DC3, DM5 of the dorsal antennal lobe. The number of glomeruli receiving the maxillary palp sensory projections tallies with the number of <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory receptors (seven) reported to be expressed exclusively in the maxillary palp. Twenty-eight Golgi-impregnated glomeruli were found to receive input from the antennal nerve. The ratio of glomeruli serving the maxillary palp to those serving the antenna (&#8764; 1 : 5) matches with the ratio of <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory receptors expressed in these two olfactory organs respectively. In addition to glomerulus V, glomeruli VP1-3, VL1, VL2a/2p and VC3m/3l were found to receive ipsilateral projections. Thus, additional ipsilateral glomeruli have been identified.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article assesses the traditional systems of accessing and using plant genetic resources as well as the benefit sharing and systems of sanctioning infringement in the context of biodiversity related activities in specific areas in the Northwest province of Cameroon. The article also addresses the type research and development activities using plant genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge in the context of Cameroon, the current laws regulating such activities and the extent to which these activities and laws affect and/or protect the customary biodiversity rights of rural communities. The article uses these assessments to suggest the context under which a <i>sui</i> generis legislation for the protection of the biodiversity rights of rural communities can be established in Cameroon.</p>

				<title>Plant resistance to cold stress: Mechanisms and environmental signals triggering frost hardening and dehardening</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0449-0459</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This introductory overview shows that cold, in particular frost, stresses a plant in manifold ways and that the plant’s response, being injurious or adaptive, must be considered a syndrome rather than a single reaction. In the course of the year perennial plants of the temperate climate zones undergo frost hardening in autumn and dehardening in spring. Using Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) as a model plant the environmental signals inducing frost hardening and dehardening, respectively, were investigated. Over 2 years the changes in frost resistance of Scots pine needles were recorded together with the annual courses of day-length and ambient temperature. Both act as environmental signals for frost hardening and dehardening. Climate chamber experiments showed that short day-length as a signal triggering frost hardening could be replaced by irradiation with far red light, while red light inhibited hardening. The involvement of phytochrome as a signal receptor could be corroborated by respective night-break experiments. More rapid frost hardening than by short day or far red treatment was achieved by applying a short period (6 h) of mild frost which did not exceed the plant’s cold resistance. Both types of signals were independently effective but the rates of frost hardening were not additive. The maximal rate of hardening was – 0.93&#176;C per day and frost tolerance of &#60; – 72&#176;C was achieved. For dehardening, temperature was an even more effective signal than day-length.</p>

				<title>Plant response strategies to stress and disturbance: the case of aquatic plants</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0461-0470</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The environmental factors controlling the establishment and development of plants in different ecosystems are of two types, stress and disturbance. The effects of stress or disturbance on aquatic systems are discussed in relation to the following questions:</p>
					<p>Can we predict the state and rate of recolonization after a disturbance? What are the strategies of recolonization developed by plants? How high is the resilience of a disturbed system? Two theories, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and the patch dynamics concept proposed to predict the composition, structure and dynamics of plants due to physical-chemical factors, were tested on two scales, that of communities and that of species, within two alluvial floodplains (the Rhine and the Rhône systems in France).</p>
					<p>With regard to the change of community on a larger scale (i.e. the whole network of the cut-off channels in the floodplain), large gradients of connection and disturbance induce high diversities within communities. Moreover, the highest flood disturbance induces a higher species richness and the occurrence of a particular species. The change in species is analysed using biological traits (morphological, reproductive or physiological). In the floodplain of the river Rhône, the response of plants corresponds well to theory, i.e. that habitats with an intermediate disturbance are richer than more or less disturbed habitats. So we can predict, through the biological traits, the functioning of a habitat. The last remaining question is that of the resilience of the system, which can be discussed in terms of species competition and the risk of biological invasion after an opening of habitat.</p>

				<title>Heat stress response in plants: a complex game with chaperones and more than twenty heat stress transcription factors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0471-0487</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Compared to the overall multiplicity of more than 20 plant Hsfs, detailed analyses are mainly restricted to tomato and Arabidopsis and to three important representatives of the family (Hsfs A1, A2 and B1). The three Hsfs represent examples of striking functional diversification specialized for the three phases of the heat stress (hs) response (triggering, maintenance and recovery). This is best illustrated for the tomato Hsf system:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>HsfA1a is the master regulator responsible for hs-induced gene expression including synthesis of HsfA2 and HsfB1. It is indispensible for the development of thermotolerance.</li>
						<li>Although functionally equivalent to HsfA1a, HsfA2 is exclusively found after hs induction and represents the dominant Hsf, the ``working horse” of the hs response in plants subjected to repeated cycles of hs and recovery in a hot summer period. Tomato HsfA2 is tightly integrated into a network of interacting proteins (HsfA1a, Hsp17-CII, Hsp17-CI) influencing its activity and intracellular distribution.</li>
						<li>Because of structural peculiarities, HsfB1 acts as coregulator enhancing the activity of HsfA1a and/or HsfA2. But in addition, it cooperates with yet to be identified other transcription factors in maintaining and/or restoring housekeeping gene expression.</li>

				<title>Habitat diversity and adaptation to environmental stress in encysted embryos of the <i>crustacean Artemia</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0489-0501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Encysted embryos (cysts) of the brine shrimp, <i>Artemia</i>, provide excellent opportunities for the study of biochemical and biophysical adaptation to extremes of environmental stress in animals. Among other virtues, this organism is found in a wide variety of hypersaline habitats, ranging from deserts, to tropics, to mountains. One adaptation implicated in the ecological success of <i>Artemia</i> is p26, a small heat shock protein that previous evidence indicates plays the role of a molecular chaperone in these embryos. We add to that evidence here. We summarize recently published work on thermal tolerance and stress protein levels in embryos from the San Francisco Bay (SFB) of California inoculated into experimental ponds in southern Vietnam where water temperatures are much higher. New results on the relative contents of three stress proteins (hsp70, artemin and p26) will be presented along with data on cysts of <i>A. tibetiana</i> collected from the high plateau of Tibet about 4.5 km above sea level. Unpublished results on the stress protein artemin are discussed briefly in the context of this paper, and its potential role as an RNA chaperone. Interestingly, we show that the substantial tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> embryos to ultraviolet (UV) light does not seem to result from intracellular biochemistry but, rather, from their surrounding thick shell, a biophysical adaptation of considerable importance since these embryos receive heavy doses of UV in nature.</p>

				<title>Ecologically relevant stress resistance: from microarrays and quantitative trait loci to candidate genes – A research plan and preliminary results using <i>Drosophila</i> as a model organism and climatic and genetic stress as model stresses</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0503-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We aim at studying adaptation to genetic and environmental stress and its evolutionary implications at different levels of biological organization. Stress influences cellular processes, individual physiology, genetic variation at the population level, and the process of natural selection. To investigate these highly connected levels of stress effects, it is advisable – if not critical – to integrate approaches from ecology, evolution, physiology, molecular biology and genetics. To investigate the mechanisms of stress resistance, how resistance evolves, and what factors contribute to and constrain its evolution, we use the well-defined model systems of <i>Drosophila</i> species, representing both cosmopolitan species such as <i>D. melanogaster</i> with a known genome map, and more specialized and ecologically well described species such as the cactophilic <i>D. buzzatii</i>. Various climate-related stresses are used as model stresses including desiccation, starvation, cold and heat. Genetic stress or genetic load is modelled by studying the consequences of inbreeding, the accumulation of (slightly) deleterious mutations, hybridization or the loss of genetic variability. We present here a research plan and preliminary results combining various approaches: molecular techniques such as microarrays, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses, quantitative PCR, ELISA or Western blotting are combined with population studies of resistance to climatic and genetic stress in natural populations collected across climatic gradients as well as in selection lines maintained in the laboratory.</p>

					<p>In an increasing number of biological laboratories, the focus of research is shifting from sequence data to the functional meaning of that data. No longer content with structural mappings, there is a renewed interest abroad in what the United States Department of Energy calls, ‘Bringing Genomes to Life’.

				<abstract>
					<p>When nuclei of somatic cells are transplanted to enucleated eggs of <i>Xenopus</i>, a complete reprogramming of nuclear function can take place. To identify mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming, somatic nuclei can be transplanted to growing meiotic oocytes of <i>Xenopus</i>, and stem cell genes activated without DNA replication. The combination of somatic cell nuclear transfer with morphogen signalling and the community effect may lead towards the possibility of cell replacement therapy. When mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming are understood, it may eventually be possible to directly reprogramme human somatic cell nuclei without the use of eggs.</p>

RIP occurs during a sexual cross and induces numerous G : C to A : T mutations in duplicated DNA sequences and also methylates many of the remaining cytosine residues. We measured the susceptibility of the <i>erg</i>-3 gene, present in single copy, to the spread of RIP from duplications of adjoining sequences. Genomic segments of defined length (1, 1.5 or 2 kb) and located at defined distances (0, 0.5, 1 or 2 kb) upstream or downstream of the <i>erg</i>-3 open reading frame (ORF) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the duplications were created by transformation of the amplified DNA. Crosses were made with the duplication strains and the frequency of <i>erg</i>-3 mutant progeny provided a measure of the spread of RIP from the duplicated segments into the <i>erg</i>-3 gene. Our results suggest that ordinarily RIP-spread does not occur. However, occasionally the mechanism that confines RIP to the duplicated segment seems to fail (frequency 0.1–0.8%) and then RIP can spread across as much as 1 kb of unduplicated DNA. Additionally, the bacterial hph gene appeared to be very susceptible to the spread of RIP-associated cytosine methylation.</p>

				<title>Stochasticity or the fatal `imperfection' of cloning</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0021-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of clone is analysed with the aim of exploring the limits to which a phenotype can be said to be determined geneticaly. First of all, mutations that result from the replication, topological manipulation or lesion of DNA introduce a source of heritable variation in an otherwise identical genetic background. But more important, stochastic effects in many biological processes may superimpose a phenotypic variation which is not encoded in the genome. The source of stochasticity ranges from the random selection of alleles or whole chromosomes to be expressed in small cell populations, to fluctuations in processes such as gene expression, due to limiting amounts of the players involved. The picture emerging is that the term clone is a statistical over-simplification representing a series of individuals having essentially the same genome but capable of exhibiting wide phenotypic variation. Finally, to what extent fluctuations in biological processes, usually thought of as noise, are in fact signal is also discussed.</p>

				<title>The return of the whole organism</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0031-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The long trend towards analysis at lower and lower levels is starting to reverse. The new integrative studies must make use of the resources uncovered by molecular biology but should also use the characteristics of whole organisms to measure the outcomes of developmental processes. Two examples are given of how movement between levels of analysis is being used with increasing power and promise. The first is the study of behavioural imprinting in birds where many of the molecular and neural mechanisms involved have been uncovered and are now being integrated to explain the behaviour of the whole animal. The second is the triggering during sensitive periods in early life by environmental events of one of several alternative modes of development leading to different phenotypes. A renewed focus on the whole organism is also starting to change the face of evolutionary biology. The decision-making and adaptability of the organism is recognized an important driver of evolution and is increasingly seen as an alternative to the gene-focused views.</p>

				<title>Do plants and animals differ in phenotypic plasticity?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0041-0050</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper compares the flexibility in the nexus between phenotype and genotype in plants and animals. These taxa although considered to be fundamentally different are found to be surprisingly similar in the mechanisms used to achieve plasticity. Although non-cognitive behaviour occurs in plants, its range is limited, while morphological and developmental plasticity also occur to a considerable extent in animals. Yet both plants and animals are subject to unique constraints and thus need to find unique solutions to functional problems. A true comparison between the plant and animal phenotype would be a comparison between plants and sessile photo-synthesizing colonial invertebrates. Such comparisons are lacking. However, they would provide important insights into the adaptive significance of plasticity in these groups. It is also suggested that a comparison of inflexible traits in these groups would provide an understanding of the constraints, as well as the costs and benefits, of a plastic versus non-plastic phenotype in plants and animals.</p>

				<title>Not in their genes: Phenotypic flexibility, behavioural traditions and cultural evolution in wild bonnet macaques</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0051-0064</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Phenotypic flexibility, or the within-genotype, context-dependent, variation in behaviour expressed by single reproductively mature individuals during their lifetimes, often impart a selective advantage to organisms and profoundly influence their survival and reproduction. Another phenomenon apparently not under direct genetic control is behavioural inheritance whereby higher animals are able to acquire information from the behaviour of others by social learning, and, through their own modified behaviour, transmit such information between individuals and across generations. Behavioural information transfer of this nature thus represents another form of inheritance that operates in many animals in tandem with the more basic genetic system. This paper examines the impact that phenotypic flexibility, behavioural inheritance and socially transmitted cultural traditions may have in shaping the structure and dynamics of a primate society – that of the bonnet macaque (<i>Macaca radiata</i>), a primate species endemic to peninsular India. Three principal issues are considered: the role of phenotypic flexibility in shaping social behaviour, the occurrence of individual behavioural traits leading to the establishment of social traditions, and the appearance of cultural evolution amidst such social traditions. Although more prolonged observations are required, these initial findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity, behavioural inheritance and cultural traditions may be much more widespread among primates than have previously been assumed but may have escaped attention due to a preoccupation with genetic inheritance in zoological thinking.</p>

				<title>Mechanisms for the environmental regulation of gene expression: Ecological aspects of animal development</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0065-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The environment can play a significant role in the production of phenotypes. However, the developmental mechanisms by which the environmental agents effect normal development are just becoming known. At least three paths have been found through which the environment can modify gene activity. The first is the neuroendocrine route. Here, the nervous system monitors the environment and transfers signals to the endocrine system. The endocrine hormones can then alter gene expression. The second route involves environmental factors that change the methylation pattern of genes, thereby altering their transcriptional capabilities. The third route involves the direct induction of gene expression in the host by microbial symbionts. The normal regulation of phenotype production by the environment should be considered a normal component of development and developmental biology.</p>

				<title>The pre-Mendelian, pre-Darwinian world: Shifting relations between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in early multicellular evolution</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0075-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reliable dependence of many features of contemporary organisms on changes in gene content and activity is tied to the processes of Mendelian inheritance and Darwinian evolution. With regard to morphological characters, however, Mendelian inheritance is the exception rather than the rule, and neo-Darwinian mechanisms in any case do not account for the origination (as opposed to the inherited variation) of such characters. It is proposed, therefore, that multicellular organisms passed through a pre-Mendelian, pre-Darwinian phase, whereby cells, genes and gene products constituted complex systems with context-dependent, self-organizing morphogenetic capabilities. An example is provided of a plausible ‘core’ mechanism for the development of the vertebrate limb that is both inherently pattern forming and morphogenetically plastic. It is suggested that most complex multicellular structures originated from such systems. The notion that genes are privileged determinants of biological characters can only be sustained by neglecting questions of evolutionary origination and the evolution of developmental mechanisms.</p>

				<title>Can morphogenesis be understood in terms of physical rules?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0087-0092</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Because the morphogenesis of biological systems is not fully understood, researches from various points of view are necessary. The present author has recently made computer simulations with his colleagues to construct branching systems of human organs, such as the lung airway and the liver blood vessels. In the simulations certain rules are assumed to govern bifurcating processes of the systems. These rules are expressed in terms of physical and geometrical concepts, such as minimum energy consumption and uniform filling of branches in the space of organs. Results of computer simulation are quite similar to real structures. However, actual mechanisms of morphogenesis, i.e. effects of genes or proteins, are not considered in these studies. In this article, the present work is discussed in relation to the concept of biological pattern formation by Meinhardt and a recent study by Miura and Shiota on lung growth.</p>

					<p>Role of heredity and lifestyle in sporadic cancers is well documented. Here we focus on the influence of low penetrance genes and habits, with emphasis on tobacco habit in causing head and neck cancers. Role of such gene-environment interaction can be well studied in individuals with multiple primary cancers. Thus such a biological model may elucidate that cancer causation is not solely due to genetic determinism but also significantly relies on lifestyle of the individual.</p>

				<title>Emergentism as a default: Cancer as a problem of tissue organization</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0103-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the last fifty years the dominant stance in experimental biology has been reductionism. For the most part, research programs were based on the notion that genes were in ‘the driver’s seat’ controlling the developmental program and determining normalcy and disease (genetic reductionism and genetic determinism). Philosophers were the first to realize that the belief that the Mendelian genes were reduced to DNA molecules was questionable. Soon after these pronouncements, experimental data confirmed their misgivings. The optimism of molecular biologists, fueled by early success in tackling relatively simple problems, has now been tempered by the difficulties found when attempting to understand complex biological problems.</p>
					<p>Here, we analyse experimental data that illustrate the shortcomings of this sort of reductionism. We also examine the prevailing paradigm in cancer research, the somatic mutation theory (SMT), the premises of which are:</p>
					<ol> 
						<li>cancer is derived from a single somatic cell that has accumulated multiple DNA mutations;</li>
						<li>the default state of cell proliferation in metazoa is quiescence; and</li>
						<li>cancer is a disease of cell proliferation caused by mutations in genes that control proliferation and the cell cycle.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We challenge the notion that cancer is a cellular problem caused by mutated genes by assessing data gathered both from within the reductionist paradigm and from an alternative view that regards carcinogenesis as a developmental process gone awry. This alternative view, explored under the name of the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), is based on premises that place cancer in a different hierarchical level of complexity from that proposed by the SMT, namely:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>carcinogenesis represents a problem of tissue organization comparable to organogenesis, and</li>
						<li>proliferation is the default state of all cells.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We propose that the organicist view, in which the TOFT is based, is a good starting point from which to explore emergent phenomena. However, new theoretical concepts are needed in order to grapple with the apparent circular causality of complex biological phenomena in development and carcinogenesis.</p>

					<p>The faculty of language is unique to the human species. This implies that there are human-specific biological changes that lie at the basis of human language. However, it is not clear what the nature of such changes are, and how they could be shaped by evolution.

This serves as a standpoint to speculate about the biological basis of the emergence and evolution of language.</p>

				<title>Language cannot be reduced to biology: Perspectives from neuro-developmental disorders affecting language learning</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0129-0137</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of language knowledge guided by a purely biological perspective prioritizes the study of syntax. The essential process of syntax is recursion – the ability to generate an infinite array of expressions from a limited set of elements. Researchers working within the biological perspective argue that this ability is possible only because of an innately specified genetic makeup that is specific to human beings. Such a view of language knowledge may be fully justified in discussions on biolinguistics, and in evolutionary biology. However, it is grossly inadequate in understanding language-learning problems, particularly those experienced by children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as developmental dyslexia, Williams syndrome, specific language impairment and autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, syntax-centered definitions of language knowledge completely ignore certain crucial aspects of language learning and use, namely, that language is embedded in a social context; that the role of envrironmental triggering as a learning mechanism is grossly underestimated; that a considerable extent of visuo-spatial information accompanies speech in day-to-day communication; that the developmental process itself lies at the heart of knowledge acquisition; and that there is a tremendous variation in the orthographic systems associated with different languages. All these (socio-cultural) factors can influence the rate and quality of spoken and written language acquisition resulting in much variation in phenotypes associated with disorders known to have a genetic component. Delineation of such phenotypic variability requires inputs from varied disciplines such as neurobiology, neuropsychology, linguistics and communication disorders. In this paper, I discuss published research that questions cognitive modularity and emphasises the role of the environment for understanding linguistic capabilities of children with neuro-developmental disorders. The discussion pertains to two specific disorders, developmental dyslexia and Williams syndrome.</p>

				<title>Ultraviolet irradiation initiates ectopic foot formation in regenerating hydra and promotes budding</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0177-0182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the effects of ultraviolet-C (UVC) and Ultraviolet-B (UVB) on growth and pattern formation in <i>Pelmatohydra oligactis</i>. UVC brings about a significant increase in budding in intact hydra while UVB does not exhibit such an effect. Excessive budding could be a response for survival at wavelengths that damage biological tissues. If the head or base piece of a bisected hydra is irradiated and recombined with the unirradiated missing part, regeneration proceeds normally indicating that exposure of a body part with either an intact head or foot to UVC does not influence pattern formation. Most significantly, in the middle piece, but not in the head or the base piece of a trisected hydra, UVC leads to initiation of ectopic feet formation in almost one third of the cases. Thus, UV irradiation interferes with pattern formation in regenerating hydra, possibly by changing positional values, and promotes budding in intact hydra. This is the first report on induction of ectopic feet formation by UV in regenerating hydra and opens up the possibility of using UV irradiation as a tool to understand pattern formation in the enigmatic hydra.</p>

				<title>In <i>vitro</i> translation of RNA to lactase during postnatal development of rat intestine</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0183-0189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>mRNA levels encoding lactase were detected by Northern blot analysis using two different probes in developing rat intestine. Probe I and probe II corresponding to second half of prolactase gene showed a 6.8 kb mRNA transcript in 7, 14, 21 and 30 day old rat intestine. There was no change in quantity of lactase mRNA detected using probe II, but hybridization with probe I showed a progressive decrease in mRNA transcript encoding lactase with age. At day 7 and 14 of postnatal development, the lactase mRNA was quite high, but it reduced upon weaning. The <i>in vitro</i> translation products of RNA detected by Western blot analysis using brush border lactase antibodies showed several isoforms of lactase antigen with molecular weight ranging from 100–220 kDa. Analysed at days 7 and 30 of postnatal development, lactase isoforms of molecular weight 130 kDa and 220 kDa were similar to those found in purified brush border membranes. The translation of RNA to 220 kDa lactase protein was high in 7 and 14 day old pups, but it was markedly reduced in 30 day old animals. These findings support the contention that translation of mRNA to lactase is impaired in weaned animals, which may also be responsible for the maturational decline in lactase activity in adult rat intestine.</p>

				<title>Tissue localization and partial characterization of pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide in <i>Achaea janata</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0191-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Female sex pheromone production in certain moth species have been shown to be regulated by a cephalic endocrine peptidic factor: pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN), having 33 amino acid residues. Antisera against synthetic <i>Heliothis zea</i>-PBAN were developed. Using these polyclonals, immunoreactivity was mapped in the nervous system of <i>Achaea janata</i>. Three distinct groups of immunopositive secretory neurons were identified in the suboesophageal ganglion; and immunoreactivity was observed in the corpora cardiaca, thoracic and in the abdominal ganglia. From about 6000 brain sub-oesophageal ganglion complexes, the neuropeptide was isolated; and purified sequentially by Sep-pak and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic methods. Identity of purified PBAN fraction was confirmed with polyclonal antibody by immunoblotting. Molecular mass of the isolated peptide was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and was found to be 3900 Da, same as that of known <i>H. zea</i>-PBAN. Radiochemical bioassay confirmed the pheromonotropic effect of the isolated neuropeptide in this insect.</p>

				<title>A non-polyene antifungal antibiotic from <i>Streptomyces albidoflavus</i> PU 23</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0201-0211</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In all 312 actinomycete strains were isolated from water and soil samples from different regions. All these isolates were purified and screened for their antifungal activity against pathogenic fungi. Out of these, 22% of the isolates exhibited activity against fungi. One promising strain, <i>Streptomyces albidoflavus</i> PU 23 with strong antifungal activity against pathogenic fungi was selected for further studies. Antibiotic was extracted and purified from the isolate. <i>Aspergillus</i> spp. was most sensitive to the antibiotic followed by other molds and yeasts. The antibiotic was stable at different temperatures and pH tested and there was no significant loss of the antifungal activity after treatment with various detergents and enzymes. Synergistic effect was observed when the antibiotic was used in combination with hamycin. The antibiotic was fairly stable for a period of 12 months at 4&#176;C. The mode of action of the antibiotic seems to be by binding to the ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane resulting in the leakage of intracellular material and eventually death of the cell. The structure of the antibiotic was determined by elemental analysis and by ultraviolet (UV), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography mass spectra (LCMS). The antibiotic was found to be a straight chain polyhydroxy, polyether, non-proteinic compound with a single double bond, indicating a nonpolyene antifungal antibiotic.</p>

				<title>cDNA cloning and characterization of a mannose-binding lectin from <i>Zingiber officinale</i> Roscoe (ginger) rhizomes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0213-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using RNA extracted from <i>Zingiber officinale</i> rhizomes and primers designed according to the conservative regions of monocot mannose-binding lectins, the full-length cDNA of <i>Z. officinale</i> agglutinin (ZOA) was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of <i>zoa</i> was 746 bp and contained a 510 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a lectin precursor of 169 amino acids with a signal peptide. ZOA was a mannose-binding lectin with three typical mannose-binding sites (QDNY). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that <i>zoa</i> expressed in all the tested tissues of <i>Z. officinale</i> including leaf, root and rhizome, suggesting it to be a constitutively expressing form. ZOA protein was successfully expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> with the molecular weight expected. To our knowledge, this is the first mannose-binding lectin cDNA cloned from the family Zingiberaceae. Our results demonstrate that monocot mannose-binding lectins also occur within the family Zingiberaceae.</p>

				<title>Efficacy of lower doses of vanadium in restoring altered glucose metabolism and antioxidant status in diabetic rat lenses</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0221-0230</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vanadium compounds are potent in controlling elevated blood glucose levels in experimentally induced diabetes. However the toxicity associated with vanadium limits its role as therapeutic agent for diabetic treatment. A vanadium compound sodium orthovanadate (SOV) was given to alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats in lower doses in combination with <i>Trigonella foenum graecum</i>, a well-known hypoglycemic agent used in traditional Indian medicines. The effect of this combination was studied on lens morphology and glucose metabolism in diabetic rats. Lens, an insulin-independent tissue, was found severely affected in diabetes showing visual signs of cataract. Alterations in the activities of glucose metabolizing enzymes (hexokinase, aldose reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase) besides the levels of related metabolites, [sorbitol, fructose, glucose, thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH)] were observed in the lenses from diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with insulin (2 IU/day), SOV (0.6 mg/ml), <i>T. f. graecum</i> seed powder (TSP, 5%) and TSP (5%) in combination with lowered dose of vanadium SOV (0.2 mg/ml), for a period of 3 weeks. The activity of the enzymes, hexokinase, aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase was significantly increased whereas the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase decreased significantly in lenses from 3 week diabetic rats. Significant increase in accumulation of metabolites, sorbitol, fructose, glucose was found in diabetic lenses. TBARS measure of peroxidation increased whereas the levels of antioxidant GSH decreased significantly in diabetic condition. Insulin restored the levels of altered enzyme activities and metabolites almost to control levels. Sodium orthovanadate (0.6 mg/ml) and <i>Trigonella</i> administered separately to diabetic animals could partially reverse the diabetic changes, metabolic and morphological, while vanadate in lowered dose in combination with <i>Trigonella</i> was found to be the most effective in restoring the altered lens metabolism and morphological appearance in diabetes. It may be concluded that vanadate at lowered doses administered in combination with <i>Trigonella</i> was the most effective in controlling the altered glucose metabolism and antioxidant status in diabetic lenses, these being significant factors involved in the development of diabetic complications, that reflects in the reduced lens opacity.</p>

				<page>0231-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is no information on drought-modulated gene(s) in tea [<i>Camellia sinensis</i> (L.) O. Kuntze], a woody and perennial plant of commercial importance. Using differential display of mRNA, three drought-modulated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified. Northern and BLAST analysis revealed that clone <i>dr1</i> (droughtresponsive), induced only by drought but not by ABA, showed significant scores with PR-5 (pathogenesis related) family of PR-protein gene. Another clone <i>dr2</i>, repressed by drought but not by ABA, had nucleotide repeats for polyasparate that are also present in chicken calsequestrin-like mRNA. Clone <i>dr3</i>, responded similarly to clone <i>dr2</i> but did not show significant homology with the reported genes, hence appears to be novel. Identification of these ESTs is an initial step to clone the full length genes and their promoters.</p>

				<title>Differential cytotoxic effects of <i>Annona squamosa</i> seed extracts on human tumour cell lines: Role of reactive oxygen species and glutathione</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0237-0244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Annonaceous acetogenins are a new class of compounds that have been reported to have potent pesticidal, parasiticidal, anti-microbial, cell growth inhibitory activities. In this study, organic and aqueous extracts from the defatted seeds of <i>Annona squamosa</i> (custard apple) were tested on different human tumour cell lines for antitumoural activity. While organic and aqueous extracts induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and K-562 cells, they failed to do so in COLO-205 cells. Treatment of MCF-7 and K-562 cells with organic and aqueous extracts resulted in nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and reduced intracellular glutathione levels. In addition downregulation of Bcl-2 and PS externalization by Annexin-V staining suggested induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 and K-562 cells by both the extracts through oxidative stress. On the contrary, COLO-205 cells showed only PS externalization but no change in ROS and glutathione levels. These observations suggest that the induction of apoptosis by <i>A. squamosa</i> extracts can be selective for certain types of cancerous cells.</p>

				<title>Liver and kidney toxicity in chronic use of opioids: An experimental long term treatment model</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0245-0252</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, histopathological and biochemical changes due to chronic usage of morphine or tramadol in liver and kidney were assessed in rats. Thirty male Wistar rats (180–220 g) were included and divided into three groups. Normal saline (1 ml) was given intraperitoneally as placebo in the control group (𝑛 = 10). Morphine group (𝑛 = 10) received morphine intraperitoneally at a dose of 4, 8, 10 mg/kg/day in the first, second and the third ten days of the study, respectively. Tramadol group (𝑛 = 10), received the drug intraperitoneally at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg/day in the first, second and the third ten days of the study, respectively. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in the serum. Liver and kidney specimens were evaluated by light microscopy. Serum ALT, AST, LDH, BUN and creatinin levels were significantly higher in morphine group compared to the control group. Serum LDH, BUN and creatinin levels were significantly increased in the morphine group compared to the tramadol group. The mean MDA level was significantly higher in morphine group compared to the tramadol and control groups (𝑃  &#60; 0.05). Light microscopy revealed severe centrolobular congestion and focal necrosis in the liver of morphine and tramadol groups, but perivenular necrosis was present only in the morphine group. The main histopathologic finding was vacuolization in tubular cells in morphine and tramadol groups. Our findings pointed out the risk of increased lipid peroxidation, hepatic and renal damage due to long term use of opioids, especially morphine. Although opioids are reported to be effective in pain management, their toxic effects should be kept in mind during chronic usage.</p>

				<page>0253-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal determination in human tissues is the most common application of biological monitoring for screening, diagnosis and assessment of metal exposures and their risks. Various biopsy-materials may be used. This paper deals with the quantitative determination of Cd, Pb, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn concentrations in nails of male subjects exposed to these metals alongwith their respective controls, while working in locomotive, carriage and roadways workshops, and lead battery factories. The levels of Cd, Pb, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn in fingernails, assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, were compared with their respective controls by student ‘𝑡’ test. All the obtained values were correlated to the personal and medical history of the subjects under study. Significantly high levels of Cd, Pb, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn were present in smokers, compared to nonsmokers. The concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cr, Mn and Fe were not significantly high in vegetarian subjects. It was also observed that there is no contribution of liquor towards nail-metal concentration. Significant correlations were observed between skin disease and Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu; hypertension and Cd, Mn, Cu; mental stress and Cd, Pb, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn; diabetes and Cr, Mn, Ni; chest pain and Pb; respiratory trouble and Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn; tuberculosis and Zn; acidity and Cd; and ophthalmic problems and Mn, Fe, Ni, and Zn.</p>

				<title>Shock wave treatment in medicine</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0269-0275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy in orthopedics and traumatology is still a young therapy method. Since the last few years the development of shock wave therapy has progressed rapidly. Shock waves have changed the treatment of urolithiasis substantially. Today shock waves are the first choice to treat kidney and urethral stones. Urology has long been the only medical field for shock waves in medicine. Meanwhile shock waves have been used in orthopedics and traumatology to treat insertion tendinitis, avascular necrosis of the head of femur and other necrotic bone alterations. Another field of shock wave application is the treatment of tendons, ligaments and bones on horses in veterinary medicine. In the present paper we discuss the basic theory and application of shock waves and its history in medicine. The idea behind using shock wave therapy for orthopedic diseases is the stimulation of healing in tendons, surrounding tissue and bones. This is a completely different approach compared to urology where shock waves are used for disintegration.</p>

				<title>Evolutionary ecology <i>in silico</i>: Does mathematical modelling help in understanding `generic' trends?</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0277-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Motivated by the results of recent laboratory experiments, as well as many earlier field observations, that evolutionary changes can take place in ecosystems over relatively short ecological time scales, several ‘unified’ mathematical models of evolutionary ecology have been developed over the last few years with the aim of describing the statistical properties of data related to the evolution of ecosystems. Moreover, because of the availability of sufficiently fast computers, it has become possible to carry out detailed computer simulations of these models. For the sake of completeness and to put these recent developments in perspective, we begin with a brief summary of some older models of ecological phenomena and evolutionary processes. However, the main aim of this article is to review critically these ‘unified’ models, particularly those published in the physics literature, in simple language that makes the new theories accessible to a wider audience.</p>

				<title>What history tells us</title>
				<feature>Series</feature>
				<page>0313-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The history of science was long considered to be something peripheral to science itself. By supplying interesting stories and gossip, it seemed, at best, to provide material for enlivening lectures. In general, it was deemed a suitable activity for retired scientists. This view has been revised considerably in the past years and indeed, today seems hopelessly out of date. History and philosophy of science are increasingly held to be an essential component of the education of scientists. By becoming acquainted with these areas, practicing scientists – and in particular biologists – can better appreciate the significance of the models and theories that underpin their research, especially with the accelerating succession of one idea by the next. The present series, of which the article that follows is the first, aims to give historical glimpses that bear on contemporary biology. The hope is that these glimpses will be both a source of inspiration and of help in resisting useless fashions.</p>

				<title>Detergent-resistant membranes in human erythrocytes and their connection to the membrane-skeleton</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0317-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In cell membranes, local inhomogeneity in the lateral distribution of lipids and proteins is thought to exist <i>in vivo</i> in the form of lipid ‘rafts’, microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and in specific classes of proteins, that appear to play specialized roles for signal transduction, cell-cell recognition, parasite or virus infection, and vesicular trafficking. These structures are operationally defined as membranes resistant to solubilization by nonionic detergents at 4&#176;C (detergent-resistant membranes, DRMs). This definition appears to be necessary and sufficient, although additional manoeuvres, not always described with sufficient detail, may be needed to ensure isolation of DRMs, like mechanical homogenization, and changes in the pH and/or ionic strength of the solubilization medium. We show here for the human erythrocyte that the different conditions adopted may lead to the isolation of qualitatively and quantitatively different DRM fractions, thus contributing to the complexity of the notion itself of lipid raft. A significant portion of erythrocyte DRMs enriched in reported lipid raft markers, such as flotillin-1, flotillin-2 and GM<sub>1</sub>, is anchored to the spectrin membrane-skeleton via electrostatic interactions that can be disrupted by the simultaneous increase in pH and ionic strength of the solubilization medium.</p>

				<title>Cloning and characterization of mouse cullin4B/E3 ubiquitin ligase</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0329-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heat induced differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells PCC4 has been reported earlier. We have further characterized the phenotype of the differentiated cells and by DD-RT-PCR identified several partial cDNAs that are differentially expressed during differentiation. Nucleotide homology search revealed that the genes corresponding to some of the up-regulated partial cDNAs are indeed part of differentiation pathway. 5&#8242; extension of an EST that has homology to one of the partial cDNAs led to the identification of mouse cullin4B. Cullin4B is coded by a separate gene and has a unique and longer amino-terminal end with a putative nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS). We have cloned, expressed and raised antibodies against the amino and carboxy-terminal halves of cullin4B. Immuno staining of differentiated PCC4 cells with N-terminal Cul4B antibody showed enhanced expression of Cul4B and its translocation into the nucleus upon differentiation. Transient transfection of a chimeric gene encoding the N-terminal part of Cul4B fused to green fluorescent protein into PCC4 cells revealed that the protein was localized in the nucleus confirming the functional significance of the putative NLS. Since cullins are involved in recognition of specific proteins for degradation, based on the evidence presented here, we hypothesize that cullin4B is probably involved in differentiation specific degradation/modification of nuclear proteins.</p>

				<title>Occurrence of Cucumber <i>mosaic virus</i> on vanilla (<i>Vanilla planifolia</i> Andrews) in India</title>

				<page>0339-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) causing mosaic, leaf distortion and stunting of vanilla (<i>Vanilla planifolia</i> Andrews) in India was characterized on the basis of biological and coat protein (CP) nucleotide sequence properties. In mechanical inoculation tests, the virus was found to infect members of Chenopodiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae and Solanaceae. <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> was found to be a suitable host for the propagation of CMV. The virus was purified from inoculated <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants and negatively stained purified preparations contained isometric particles of about 28 nm in diameter. The molecular weight of the viral coat protein subunits was found to be 25.0 kDa. Polyclonal antiserum was produced in New Zealand white rabbit, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified and conjugated with alkaline phosphatase enzyme. Double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) method was standardized for the detection of CMV infection in vanilla plants. CP gene of the virus was amplified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cloned and sequenced. Sequenced region contained a single open reading frame of 657 nucleotides potentially coding for 218 amino acids. Sequence analyses with other CMV isolates revealed the greatest identity with black pepper isolate of CMV (99%) and the phylogram clearly showed that CMV infecting vanilla belongs to subgroup IB. This is the first report of occurrence of CMV on <i>V. planifolia</i> from India.</p>

				<title>Expression of a ribosome inactivating protein (curcin 2) in <i>Jatropha curcas</i> is induced by stress</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0351-0357</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The open reading frame (ORF) encoding curcin 2 was cloned from total genomic and cDNA of <i>Jatropha curcas</i> leaves, which were treated by drought, temperature stress and fungal infection, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR amplification. The ORF has 927 bp that encodes a precursor protein of 309 amino acid residues. There are high similarities with curcin and the conserved domain of ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). Antiserum to curcin recognized one band of 32 kDa on Western blot of the leaves treated by temperature stresses at 4&#176;C and 50&#176;C and by fungal infections of <i>Pestalotia funerea, Curvularia lunata</i> (Walk) Boed, <i>Gibberelle zeae</i> (Schw.) Petch. Two bands of 32 kDa and 65 kDa were recognized on Western blot of the leaves treated by 10%–40% polyethylene glycol (PEG). In addition, the 32 kDa band is nearly the molecular weight of curcin 2. This finding suggests that the protein of 32 kDa should be related to curcin 2. The presence of this protein molecular marker under stresses may provide an experimental foundation to study the stress proteins in <i>J. curcas</i>.</p>

				<title>Epitope mapping from real time kinetic studies – Role of cross-linked disulphides and incidental interacting regions in affinity measurements: Study with human chorionic gonadotropin and monoclonal antibodies</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0359-0370</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Real time kinetic studies were used to map conformational epitopes in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The epitopes were identified in the regions (𝛼5–14 and 𝛼55–62). The association rate constant (𝑘<sub>+1</sub>) was found to be altered by chemical modification of hCG, and the ionic strength of the reaction medium. Based on these changes, we propose the presence of additional interactions away from the epitope-paratope region in the hCG-MAb reaction. We have identified such incidental interacting regions (IIRs) in hCG to be the loop region 𝛼35–47 and 𝛼60–84. The IIRs contribute significantly towards the 𝐾<sub>𝐴</sub> of the interaction. Therefore, in a macromolecular interaction of hCG and its MAb, 𝐾<sub>𝐴</sub> is determined not only by epitopeparatope interaction but also by the interaction of the nonepitopic-nonparatopic IIRs. However, the specificity of the interaction resides exclusively with the epitope-paratope pair.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Ewing’s sarcoma family can present diagnostic difficulties. In the past the basis of diagnosis has been a exclusion. Identification of a specific translocation especially t(11; 22) (EWS-FLI 1 fusion gene), which is seen in nearly 85% of Ewing’s sarcoma cases can help in precise diagnosis. We have carried out a study on twenty patient samples diagnosed to have Ewing’s sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumour (PNET)/small round cell malignant tumour. The study involved RT-PCR analysis for the fusion transcript, followed by sequencing to identify the specific type of fusion. Ninety percent (18/20) of the samples tested were found to be t(11; 22) translocations involving EWS-FLI 1 genes. Sixty-one percent (11/18) were found to be type 1 fusion and seven were type 2 (39%). This is the first study in India with quantitative information about the types of EWS-FLI 1 translocations present in Ewing’s family of tumours in south Indian patients.</p>

				<title>Bilaterally symmetric Fourier approximations of the skull outlines of temnospondyl amphibians and their bearing on shape comparison</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0377-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Present work illustrates a scheme of quantitative description of the shape of the skull outlines of temnospondyl amphibians using bilaterally symmetric closed Fourier curves. Some special points have been identified on the Fourier fits of the skull outlines, which are the local maxima, or minima of the distances from the centroid of the points at the skull outline. These points denotes break in curvature of the outline and their positions can be compared to differentiate the skull shapes. The ratios of arc-lengths of the posterior and lateral outline of 58 temnospondyl skulls have been plotted to generate a triaguarity series of the skulls. This series grades different families, some of their genera and species as well as some individuals according to their posterior and lateral skull length ratios. This model while comparing different taxa, takes into account the entire arc-length of the outline of the temnospondyl skulls, and does not depend on few geometric or biological points used by earlier workers for comparing skull shapes.</p>

				<title>Molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 associated neurodegeneration</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0391-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Since identification of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), numerous studies suggest a link between neurological impairments, in particular dementia, with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with alarming occurrence worldwide. Approximately, 60% of HIV-infected people show some form of neurological impairment, and neuropathological changes are found in 90% of autopsied cases. Approximately 30% of untreated HIV-infected persons may develop dementia. The mechanisms behind these pathological changes are still not understood. Mounting data obtained by <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments suggest that neuronal apoptosis is a major feature of HIV associated dementia (HAD), which can occur in the absence of direct infection of neurons. The major pathway of neuronal apoptosis occurs indirectly through release of neurotoxins by activated cells in the central nervous system (CNS) involving the induction of excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. In addition a direct mechanism induced by viral proteins in the pathogenesis of HAD may also play a role. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of HIV-associated dementia and possible therapeutic strategies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work we report the variation in swimming speed of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> with respect to the change in concentration of sodium ions in the medium. We have also studied the variation in swimming speed with respect to temperature. We find that the swimming speed initially shows a linear increase with the increase of the sodium ions in the medium and then plateaus. The range within which the swimming speed attains saturation is approximately the same at different temperatures.</p>

				<title>Kinetics of fatty acid binding ability of glycated human serum albumin</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0475-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of fatty acid binding ability of glycated human serum albumin (HSA) were investigated by fluorescent displacement technique with 1-anilino-8-naphtharene sulphonic acid (ANS method), and photometric detection of nonesterified-fatty-acid (NEFA method). Changing of binding affinities of glycated HSA toward oleic acid, linoleic acid, lauric acid, and caproic acid, were not observed by the ANS method. However, decreases of binding capacities after 55 days glycation were confirmed by the NEFA method in comparison to control HSA. The decrease in binding affinities was: oleic acid (84%), linoleic acid (84%), lauric acid (87%), and caproic acid (90%), respectively. The decreases were consistent with decrease of the intact lysine residues in glycated HSA. The present observation indicates that HSA promptly loses its binding ability to fatty acid as soon as the lysine residues at fatty acid binding sites are glycated.</p>

				<title>Amelioration of altered antioxidant status and membrane linked functions by vanadium and <i>Trigonella</i> in alloxan diabetic rat brains</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0483-0490</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Trigonella foenum graecum</i> seed powder (TSP) and sodium orthovanadate (SOV) have been reported to have antidiabetic effects. However, SOV exerts hypoglycemic effects at relatively high doses with several toxic effects. We used low doses of vanadate in combination with TSP and evaluated their antidiabetic effects on antioxidant enzymes and membrane-linked functions in diabetic rat brains. In rats, diabetes was induced by alloxan monohydrate (15 mg/100 g body wt.) and they were treated with 2 IU insulin, 0.6 mg/ml SOV, 5% TSP and a combination of 0.2 mg/ml SOV with 5% TSP for 21 days. Blood glucose levels, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, membrane lipid peroxidation and fluidity were determined in different fractions of whole brain after 21 days of treatment. Diabetic rats showed high blood glucose (𝑃  &#60; 0.001), decreased activities of SOD, catalase and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (𝑃  &#60; 0.01, 𝑃  &#60; 0.001 and 𝑃  &#60; 0.01), increased levels of GPx and MDA (𝑃  &#60; 0.01 and 𝑃 &#60; 0.001) and decreased membrane fluidity (𝑃  &#60; 0.01). Treatment with different antidiabetic compounds restored the above-altered parameters. Combined dose of <i>Trigonella</i> and vanadate was found to be the most effective treatment in normalizing these alterations. Lower doses of vanadate could be used in combination with TSP to effectively counter diabetic alterations without any toxic effects.</p>

				<title>Enhanced analgesic effect of morphine-nimodipine combination after intraspinal administration as compared to systemic administration in mice</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0491-0497</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Calcium plays an important role in the pathophysiology of pain. A number of studies have investigated the effect of L-type calcium channel blockers on the analgesic response of morphine. However, the results are conflicting. In the present study, the antinociceptive effect of morphine (2.5 𝜇g) and nimodipine (1 𝜇g) co-administered intraspinally in mice was observed using the tail flick test. It was compared to the analgesic effect of these drugs (morphine – 250 𝜇g subcutaneously; nimodipine – 100 𝜇g intraperitoneally) after systemic administration. Nimodipine is highly lipophilic and readily crosses the blood brain barrier. Addition of nimodipine to morphine potentiated the analgesic response of the latter when administered through the intraspinal route but not when administered through systemic route. It may be due to direct inhibitory effect of morphine and nimodipine on neurons of superficial laminae of the spinal cord after binding to 𝜇-opioid receptors and L-type calcium channels respectively.</p>

				<title>Indian herb `<i>Sanjeevani</i>' (<i>Selaginella bryopteris</i>) can promote growth and protect against heat shock and apoptotic activities of ultra violet and oxidative stress</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0499-0505</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Selaginella bryopteris</i> is a lithophyte with remarkable ressurection capabilities. It is full of medicinal properties, hence also known as ‘<i>Sanjeevani</i>’ (one that infuses life). For lack of credible scientific evidence the plant is not in active use as a medicinal herb. We provide scientific evidence for why <i>S. bryopteris</i> is known as ‘<i>Sanjeevani</i>’.</p>
					<p>The aqueous extract of <i>S. bryopteris</i> possesses growth-promoting activity as well as protective action against stress-induced cell death in a number of experimental cell systems including mammalian cells. Treatment of the cells in culture with 10% aqueous extract enhanced cell growth by about 41% in <i>Sf9</i> cells and 78% in mammalian cells. Pre-treatment of cells with the Selaginella extract (SE) (1–2.5%) protected against oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced cell death. The killing potential of ultra violet (UV) was also significantly reduced when the cells were pre-treated with SE for 1 h. Thermal radiation suppressed cell growth by about 50%. Pre-treatment of cells with SE for 1 h afforded complete protection against heat-induced growth suppression. SE may possess anti-stress and antioxidant activities that could be responsible for the observed effects. Chemical analysis shows that SE contains hexoses and proteins. Taken together, <i>S. bryopteris</i> extract may help in stress-induced complications including those due to heat shock.</p>

				<title>Contribution of root respiration to soil respiration in a C<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> mixed grassland</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0507-0514</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The spatial and temporal variations of soil respiration were studied from May 2004 to June 2005 in a C<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> mixed grassland of Japan. The linear regression relationship between soil respiration and root biomass was used to determine the contribution of root respiration to soil respiration. The highest soil respiration rate of 11.54 𝜇mol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> was found in August 2004 and the lowest soil respiration rate of 4.99 𝜇mol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> was found in April 2005. Within-site variation was smaller than seasonal change in soil respiration. Root biomass varied from 0.71 kg m<sup>–2</sup> in August 2004 to 1.02 in May 2005. Within-site variation in root biomass was larger than seasonal variation. Root respiration rate was highest in August 2004 (5.7 𝜇mol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) and lowest in October 2004 (1.7 𝜇mol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). Microbial respiration rate was highest in August 2004 (5.8 𝜇mol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) and lowest in April 2005 (2.59 𝜇mol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). We estimated that the contribution of root respiration to soil respiration ranged from 31% in October to 51% in August of 2004, and from 45% to 49% from April to June 2005.</p>

				<title>Will transgenic plants adversely affect the environment?</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0515-0548</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Transgenic insecticidal plants based on <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) endotoxins, on proteinase inhibitors and on lectins, and transgenic herbicide tolerant plants are widely used in modern agriculture. The results of the studies on likelihood and non-likelihood of adverse effects of transgenic plants on the environment including:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>effects on nontarget species;</li>
						<li>invasiveness;</li>
						<li>potential for transgenes to `escape’ into the environment by horizontal gene transfer; and</li>
						<li>adverse effects on soil biota are reviewed.</li>
					 </ol>
					 <p>In general, it seems that large-scale implementation of transgenic insecticidal and herbicide tolerant plants do not display considerable negative effects on the environments and, moreover, at least some transgenic plants can improve the corresponding environments and human health because their production considerably reduces the load of chemical insecticides and herbicides.</p>

				<title>Detergent-resistant membranes in human erythrocytes and their connection to the membrane-skeleton</title>
				<feature>Erratum</feature>
				<page>0549-0549</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In cell membranes, local inhomogeneity in the lateral distribution of lipids and proteins is thought to exist <i>in vivo</i> in the form of lipid ‘rafts’, microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and in specific classes of proteins, that appear to play specialized roles for signal transduction, cell-cell recognition, parasite or virus infection, and vesicular trafficking. These structures are operationally defined as membranes resistant to solubilization by nonionic detergents at 4&#176;C (detergent-resistant membranes, DRMs). This definition appears to be necessary and sufficient, although additional manoeuvres, not always described with sufficient detail, may be needed to ensure isolation of DRMs, like mechanical homogenization, and changes in the pH and/or ionic strength of the solubilization medium. We show here for the human erythrocyte that the different conditions adopted may lead to the isolation of qualitatively and quantitatively different DRM fractions, thus contributing to the complexity of the notion itself of lipid raft. A significant portion of erythrocyte DRMs enriched in reported lipid raft markers, such as flotillin-1, flotillin-2 and GM<sub>1</sub>, is anchored to the spectrin membrane-skeleton via electrostatic interactions that can be disrupted by the simultaneous increase in pH and ionic strength of the solubilization medium.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Associations were analysed between polymorphisms of the growth hormone gene (<i>GH-Msp</i>I) (localized in intron 3) and milk production traits of Beijing Holstein cows (a total of 543 cows). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used for identification of various genotypes. Frequencies of genotypes were 0.77, 0.21 and 0.02 for A/A, A/B and B/B, respectively. The frequency of the 𝐺𝐻<sup>𝐴</sup> allele is 0.875.</p>
					<p>The results of the least squares means show that in all three lactations, the <i>GH</i> A/A cows yielded more milk (𝑃  &#60; 0.01 for lactation I and 𝑃  &#60; 0.05 for lactations II and III), whereas A/B cows showed higher milk fat content than A/A individuals (𝑃  &#60; 0.05 for lactations I and II, and 𝑃  &#60; 0.01 for lactation III). The A/A cows yielded more fat than A/B individuals (𝑃 &#60; 0.01 only in lactation I). The A/A cows yielded more milk protein than A/B individuals (𝑃  &#60; 0.01 for lactations I, II, and III). The A/A cows produced milk of higher protein content than of A/B individuals (𝑃  &#60; 0.05 only in lactation II).</p>

				<title>Single gene retrieval from thermally degraded DNA</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0599-0604</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To simulate single gene retrieval from ancient DNA, several related factors have been investigated. By monitoring a 889 bp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product and genomic DNA degradation, we find that heat and oxygen (especially heat) are both crucial factors influencing DNA degradation. The heat influence, mainly represented by temperature and heating time, affects the DNA degradation via DNA depurination followed by cleavage of nearby phosphodiesters. The heating time influence is temperature-dependent. By reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and 1,3-diphenyl-isobenzofuran (DPBF) bleaching experiments the influence of oxygen on DNA thermal degradation was shown to occur via a singlet oxygen pathway. A comparative study of the thermal degradation of cellular DNA and isolated DNA showed that cellular lipids can aggravate DNA thermal degradation. These results confirm the possibility of gene amplification from thermally degraded DNA. They can be used to evaluate the feasibility of the retrieval of single gene from ancient remains.</p>

				<title>Cloning and sequence analysis of the <i>Antheraea pernyi</i> nucleopolyhedrovirus <i>gp64</i> gene</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0605-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Frequent outbreaks of the purulence disease of Chinese oak silkworm are reported in Middle and Northeast China. The disease is produced by the pathogen <i>Antheraea pernyi</i> nucleopolyhedrovirus (AnpeNPV). To obtain molecular information of the virus, the polyhedra of AnpeNPV were purified and characterized. The genomic DNA of AnpeNPV was extracted and digested with <i>Hind</i>III. The genome size of AnpeNPV is estimated at 128 kb. Based on the analysis of DNA fragments digested with <i>Hind</i>III, 23 fragments were bigger than 564 bp. A genomic library was generated using <i>Hind</i>III and the positive clones were sequenced and analysed. The <i>gp64</i> gene, encoding the baculovirus envelope protein GP64, was found in an insert. The nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the AnpeNPV <i>gp64</i> gene consists of a 1530 nucleotide open reading frame (ORF), encoding a protein of 509 amino acids. Of the eight <i>gp64</i> homologues, the AnpeNPV <i>gp64</i> ORF shared the most sequence similarity with the <i>gp64</i> gene of <i>Anticarsia gemmatalis</i> NPV, but not <i>Bombyx mori</i> NPV. The upstream region of the AnpeNPV <i>gp64</i> ORF encoded the conserved transcriptional elements for early and late stage of the viral infection cycle. These results indicated that AnpeNPV belongs to group I NPV and was far removed in molecular phylogeny from the BmNPV.</p>

				<title>The amino-terminal domain of human signal transducers and activators of transcription 1: Overexpression, purification and characterization</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0611-0618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dual functional signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that play crucial roles in host defense. Animals that lack these proteins are highly susceptible to microbial and viral infections and chemically induced primary tumours. We have over expressed the aminoterminal domain of human STAT1 (hSTAT1) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and purified it by affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. The entire process has been monitored by gel electrophoresis. The pure protein has been characterized by mass spectrometry and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the N-terminus of hSTAT1 exists as a dimer in solution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have cloned, sequenced and analysed all the five classes of the intergenic (16S-23S rRNA) spacer region (ISR) associated with the eight <i>rrn</i> operons (<i>rrna-rrn</i>h) of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> serogroup O1 El Tor strains isolated before, during and after the O139 outbreak. ISR classes ‘a’ and ‘g’ were found to be invariant, ISR-B (ISRb and ISRe) exhibited very little variation, whereas ISR-C (ISRc, ISRd, and ISRf) and ISRh showed the maximum variation. Phylogenetic analysis conducted with all three ISR classes (ISR-B, ISR-C and ISRh) showed that the pre-O139 serogroup and post-O139 serogroup O1 El Tor strains arose out of two independent clones, which was congruent with the observation made by earlier workers suggesting that analyses of ISR-C and ISR-h, instead of all five ISR classes, could be successfully used to study phylogeny in this organism.</p>

				<title>Enhancement of resistance to aphids by introducing the snowdrop lectin <i>gene gna</i> into maize plants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0627-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to enhance the resistance to pests, transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) plants from elite inbred lines containing the gene encoding snowdrop lectin (<i>Galanthus nivalis</i> L. agglutinin; GNA) under control of a phloemspecific promoter were generated through the <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated method. The toxicity of GNA-expressing plants to aphids has also been studied. The independently derived plants were subjected to molecular analyses. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analyses confirmed that the <i>gna</i> gene was integrated into maize genome and inherited to the following generations. The typical Mendelian patterns of inheritance occurred in most cases. The level of GNA expression at 0.13%–0.28% of total soluble protein was observed in different transgenic plants. The progeny of nine GNA-expressing independent transformants that were derived separately from the elite inbred lines DH4866, DH9942, and 8902, were selected for examination of resistance to aphids. These plants synthesized GNA at levels above 0.22% total soluble protein, and enhanced resistance to aphids was demonstrated by exposing the plants to corn leaf aphid (<i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i> Fitch) under greenhouse conditions. The nymph production was significantly reduced by 46.9% on GNA-expressing plants. Field evaluation of the transgenic plants supported the results from the inoculation trial. After a series of artificial self-crosses, some homozygous transgenic maize lines expressing GNA were obtained. In the present study, we have obtained new insect-resistant maize material for further breeding work.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two cadmium resistant mutants (Cd<sub>1</sub> and Cd<sub>2</sub>) of <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, among the six isolated by mutagenization with N-methyl N&#8242;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) at pH 6.4 were selected for the study. Analysis of lipid composition of the mutants and the wildtype indicated that total lipid as well as individual lipids of the cadmium resistant mutants were changed as compared with that of the wildtype. The increased activities of metal-lothionein and reduced activities of D-xylose isomerase and L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase in cell free extract of the cadmium resistant mutants suggested that mutants could allow high concentration of cadmium salt as compared with that of the wildtype. The respiratory activity and intracellular as well as extracellular Cd<sup>2+</sup> concentration of the mutants reflected the high tolerance of the Cd mutants to cadmium ion.</p>

				<title>Transgenic tobacco plants expressing <i>BoRS1</i> gene from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> var. <i>acephala</i> show enhanced tolerance to water stress</title>

				<page>0647-0655</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Water stress is by far the leading environmental stress limiting crop yields worldwide. Genetic engineering techniques hold great promise for developing crop cultivars with high tolerance to water stress. In this study, the <i>Brassica oleracea</i> var. <i>acephala BoRS1</i> gene was transferred into tobacco through <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated leaf disc transformation. The transgenic status and transgene expression of the transgenic plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, Southern hybridization and semi-quantitative one step RT-PCR analysis respectively. Subsequently, the growth status under water stress, and physiological responses to water stress of transgenic tobacco were studied. The results showed that the transgenic plants exhibited better growth status under water stress condition compared to the untransformed control plants. In physiological assessment of water tolerance, transgenic plants showed more dry matter accumulation and maintained significantly higher levels of leaf chlorophyll content along with increasing levels of water stress than the untransformed control plants. This study shows that <i>BoRS1</i> is a candidate gene in the engineering of crops for enhanced water stress tolerance.</p>

				<title>Expression profiles of hot pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) genes under cold stress conditions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0657-0667</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In an attempt to determine a cold defense mechanism in plants, we have attempted to characterize changes occurring in the expression of cold-regulated transcript levels in the hot pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>), using cDNA microarray analysis, combined with Northern blot analysis. After analysing a 3.1 K hot pepper cDNA microarray, we isolated a total of 317 cold inducible genes. We selected 42 genes which were up-regulated and three genes which were down-regulated due to cold treatment, for further analysis. Among the 45 genes which appeared to be up-regulated by cold, 19 genes appeared to be simultaneously regulated by salt stress. Among the up-regulated cold-stress genes, we identified a variety of transcription factors, including: a family of 4 ethylene-responsive element binding protein (EREBP, designated CaEREBP-C1 to C4) genes, a bZIP protein (CaBZ1), RVA1, Ring domain protein, HSF1, and the WRKY (CaWRKY1) protein. As mentioned earlier, several genes appeared to be induced not only by cold stress, but also simultaneously by salt stress. These genes included: CaEREBP-C3, CaBZ1, putative <i>trans</i>-activator factor, NtPRp27, malate dehydrogenase, putative auxin-repressed protein, protein phosphatase (CaTPP1), SAR8.2 protein precursor, late-embryogenesis abundant protein 5 (LEA5), DNAJ protein homologue, xyloglucanendo-1,4-𝛽-D-gucanase precursor, PR10, and the putative non-specific lipid transfer protein StnsLTP.</p>

				<title>Single primer amplification reaction methods reveal exotic and indigenous mulberry varieties are similarly diverse</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0669-0677</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mulberry is the sole food source for mulberry silkworm and a number of indigenous and exotic varieties are used in sericulture. Studies on assessment of genetic diversity have been done amongst a few mulberry varieties using one or at the most two methods. However, no comprehensive study on a large number of varieties has been carried out. In present study, single primer amplification reaction (SPAR) methods have been used for determination of diversity in 27 mulberry varieties (exotic as well as indigenous), using four minisatellite core sequence primers for directed amplification of minisatellite DNA (DAMD), three simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs as primers for inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and 20 arbitrary sequence decamer primers for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) reactions. The Jaccard coefficients were determined for the DAMD, ISSR and RAPD band data (total of 58, 39 and 235 bands respectively). All three methods revealed wide range of distances supporting a wide range of mulberry genetic diversity. A cumulative analysis of the data generated by three methods resulted in a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree that gave a better reflection of the relatedness and affinities of the varieties to each other. Comparison of the three methods by marker indices and the Mantel test of correlation indicated that though all methods were useful for the assessment of diversity in mulberry, the DAMD method was better. When considered as two groups (10 exotic and 17 indigenous varieties), the mulberry varieties in the exotic group were found to have slightly greater diversity than the indigenous ones. These results support the concept of naturalization of mulberry varieties at locales distant from their origins.</p>

				<title>Chemosensory processing in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: Generalization of a feeding response reveals overlapping odour representations</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0679-0688</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Insects are capable of detecting, and discriminating between, a very large number of odours. The biological relevance of many of those odours, particularly those related to food, must first be learned. Given that the number of sensory receptors and antennal lobe (AL) glomeruli is limited relative to the number of odours that must be detectable, this ability implies that the olfactory system makes use of a combinatorial coding scheme whereby each sensory cell or AL projection neuron can participate in coding for several different odours. An important step in understanding this coding scheme is to behaviourally quantify the degree to which sets of odours are discriminable. Here we evaluate odour discriminability in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, by first conditioning individual flies to not respond to any of several odourants using a nonassociative conditioning protocol (habituation). We show that flies habituate unconditioned leg movement responses to both mechanosensory and olfactory stimulation over 25 unreinforceed trials. Habituation is retained for at least 2 h and is subject to dishabituation. Finally, we test the degree to which the conditioned response generalizes to other odourants based on molecular features of the odourants (e.g. carbon chain length and the presence of a target functional group). These tests reveal predictable generalization gradients across these molecular features. These data substantiate the claim that these features are relevant coding dimensions in the fruit fly olfactory system, as has been shown for other insect and vertebrate species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The phenotypic plasticity of abdominal bristle number (segments 3 and 4 in females) was investigated in 10 isofemale lines from a French population, grown at 7 constant temperatures, ranging from 12&#176; to 31&#176;C. Overall concave reaction norms were obtained with a maximum around 20&#176;–21&#176;C. Intraclass correlation (isofemale line heritability) was not affected by temperature. Correlations between segments 3 and 4 strongly contrasted a low within-line phenotypic correlation (𝑟 = 0.39 &#177; 0.04) and a high, between-line genetic correlation (𝑟 = 0.89 &#177; 0.03). A significant decrease of the genetic correlation was observed when comparing more different temperatures. Finally, among 7 other morphometrical traits which were measured on the same set of lines, 3 provided a significant positive genetic correlation with abdominal bristles: thoracic bristles, abdomen pigmentation and thoracic pigmentation.</p>

				<title>Structure and function of the spermathecal complex in the phlebotomine sandfly <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i> Scopoli (Diptera: Psychodidae): I. Ultrastructure and histology</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0711-0731</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Females of phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) possess highly variable spermathecae that present several important taxonomic characters. The cause of this diversity remains a neglected field of sandfly biology, but may possibly be due to female post-mating sexual selection. To understand this diversity, a detailed study of the structure and function of the spermathecal complex in at least one of the species was a prerequisite. Using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, described here is ultrastructure of the spermathecal complex in the sand fly, <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i> Scopoli. The spermathecal complexes are paired; each consists of a long spermathecal duct, a cylindrical spermathecal body, and a spherical spermathecal gland. Muscle fibres, nerves, tracheoles, and vascular sinuses connect the spermathecal body and duct through the epithelial layers. Spermathecal gland is formed by a typical insect epidermis and consisting of an epithelial layer of class-1 epidermal cells and elaborate glandular cells of class-3 epidermal cells, each having both receiving and conducting ductules (i.e. “end apparatus”) and a “cytological apodeme”, which is a newly described cell structure. The spermathecal body and duct are lined by class-1 epidermal cells and a cuticle, and are enveloped by a super-contracting visceral muscular system. The cuticle consists of rubber-like resilin, and its fibrillar arrangement and chemical nature are described. A well-developed neuromuscular junction exists between the spermathecal gland and the spermathecal body, which are connected to each other by a nerve and a muscle. The spermathecal complexes of the sandfly are compared with those of other insect species. The physiological role and possible evolutionary significance of the different parts of spermathecal complex in the sandfly are inferred from the morphology and behaviour. Post-mating sexual selection may be responsible for the structural uniqueness of the spermathecal complex in phlebotomine sandflies.</p>

				<title>Structure and function of the spermathecal complex in the phlebotomine sandfly <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i> Scopoli (Diptera: Psychodidae): II. Post-copulatory histophysiological changes during the gonotrophic cycle</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The spermathecal complex of <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i> Scopoli (Diptera: Psychodidae) undergoes histological and physiological changes during its gonotropic cycle. The present histochemical study revealed a mucopolysaccharide secretory mass in the spermathecae of the newly emerged sandfly. Sperm competition occurs when two or more males compete to fertilize an ovum in the female reproductive tract. In this study, spermatophores of two or more competing males were deposited at the base of the spermathecal ducts, which originate from the female bursa copulatrix. This suggests that females play a role in sperm displacement, which is defined as any situation in which the last male to mate with a female fertilizes maximum number her eggs. A blood meal ingested by the female for ovary development and egg laying stimulates the release of sperm from the spermatophore. The spermatozoa then migrate to the lumen of the spermatheca. The ultrastructure of spermatozoa comprises a head with double-layered acrosomal perforatorium, an elongate nucleus, and the axoneme with a 9 + 9 + 0 flagellar pattern. This axomene differs from the aflagellate axoneme of other Psychodinae. Morphological changes, such as the casting off of the acrosomal membrane, and histological changes in the spermatophore are also described. Mating plugs that have been described previously in sandflies appear to be artefacts. Females of <i>P. papatasi</i> may be inseminated more than once during each gonotrophic cycle, and additional inseminations may be necessary for each cycle. The relationships between the volumes of the sperm and the spermatheca were calculated to determine sperm utilization and fecundity of <i>P. papatasi</i>. As the females of <i>P. papatasi</i> mate polyandrously, the anatomical and physiological complexity of the spermathecal complex may be related to post-copulatory sexual selection.</p>

				<title>Nutrients and toxin producing phytoplankton control algal blooms – a spatio-temporal study in a noisy environment</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0749-0760</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A phytoplankton-zooplankton prey-predator model has been investigated for temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal dissipative pattern formation in a deterministic and noisy environment, respectively. The overall carrying capacity for the phytoplankton population depends on the nutrient level. The role of nutrient concentrations and toxin producing phytoplankton for controlling the algal blooms has been discussed. The local analysis yields a number of stationary and/or oscillatory regimes and their combinations. Correspondingly interesting is the spatio-temporal behaviour, modelled by stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. The present study also reveals the fact that the rate of toxin production by toxin producing phytoplankton (TPP) plays an important role for controlling oscillations in the plankton system. We also observe that different mortality functions of zooplankton due to TPP have significant influence in controlling oscillations, coexistence, survival or extinction of the zooplankton population. External noise can enhance the survival and spread of zooplankton that would go extinct in the deterministic system due to a high rate of toxin production.</p>

				<title>Sugar signalling and gene expression in relation to carbohydrate metabolism under abiotic stresses in plants</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0761-0776</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sucrose is required for plant growth and development. The sugar status of plant cells is sensed by sensor proteins. The signal generated by signal transduction cascades, which could involve mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein phosphatases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulins, results in appropriate gene expression. A variety of genes are either induced or repressed depending upon the status of soluble sugars. Abiotic stresses to plants result in major alterations in sugar status and hence affect the expression of various genes by down- and up-regulating their expression. Hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent pathways are involved in sugar sensing. Sucrose also acts as a signal molecule as it affects the activity of a proton-sucrose symporter. The sucrose transporter acts as a sucrose sensor and is involved in phloem loading. Fructokinase may represent an additional sensor that bypasses hexokinase phosphorylation especially when sucrose synthase is dominant. Mutants isolated on the basis of response of germination and seedling growth to sugars and reporter-based screening protocols are being used to study the response of altered sugar status on gene expression. Common <i>cis</i>-acting elements in sugar signalling pathways have been identified. Transgenic plants with elevated levels of sugars/sugar alcohols like fructans, raffinose series oligosaccharides, trehalose and mannitol are tolerant to different stresses but have usually impaired growth. Efforts need to be made to have transgenic plants in which abiotic stress responsive genes are expressed only at the time of adverse environmental conditions instead of being constitutively synthesized.</p>

				<title>Allele-specific suppression of the temperature sensitivity of <i>fitA/fitB</i> mutants of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by a new mutation (<i>fitC4</i>): isolation, characterization and its implications in transcription control</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0031-0045</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The temperature sensitive transcription defective mutant of <i>Escherichia coli</i> originally called <i>fitA76</i> has been shown to harbour two missense mutations namely <i>pheS5</i> and <i>fit95</i>. In order to obtain a suppressor of <i>fitA76</i>, possibly mapping in <i>rpoD</i> locus, a Ts<sup>+</sup> derivative (JV4) was isolated from a <i>fitA76</i> mutant. It was found that JV4 neither harbours the lesions present in the original <i>fitA76</i> nor a suppressor that maps in or near <i>rpoD</i>. We show that JV4 harbours a modified form of <i>fitA76</i> (designated <i>fit</i>A76*) together with its suppressor. The results presented here indicate that the <i>fit95</i> lesion is intact in the <i>fitA76</i>* mutant and the modification should be at the position of <i>pheS5</i>. Based on the cotransduction of the suppressor mutation and/or its wild type allele with <i>pps, aroD</i> and <i>zdj-3124</i>::Tn<i>10 kan</i> we have mapped its location to 39⋅01 min on the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome. We tentatively designate the locus defined by this new extragenic suppressor as <i>fit</i>C and the suppressor allele as <i>fitC4</i>. While <i>fitC4</i> could suppress the Ts phenotype of <i>fitA76</i>* present in JV4, it fails to suppress the Ts phenotype of the original <i>fitA76</i> mutant (harbouring <i>pheS5</i> and <i>fit95</i>). Also <i>fitC4</i> could suppress the Ts phenotype of a strain harbouring only <i>pheS5</i>. Interestingly, the <i>fitC4</i> Ts phenotype could also be suppressed by <i>fit95</i>. The pattern of decay of pulse labelled RNA in the strains harbouring <i>fitC4</i> and the <i>fitA76</i>* resembles that of the original <i>fitA76</i> mutant implying a transcription defect similar to that of <i>fitA76</i> in both these mutants. The implications of these findings with special reference to transcription control by Fit factors <i>in vivo</i> are discussed.</p>

				<title>Coat protein sequence shows that <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> isolate from geraniums (<i>Pelargonium</i> spp.) belongs to subgroup II</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0047-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A viral disease was identified on geraniums (<i>Pelargonium</i> spp.) grown in a greenhouse at the Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, exhibiting mild mottling and stunting. The causal virus (<i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i>, CMV) was identified and characterized on the basis of host range, aphid transmission, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), DNA-RNA hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). A complete coat protein (CP) gene was amplified using degenerate primers and sequenced. The CP gene showed nucleotide and amino acid homology up to 97%–98% and 96%–99%, respectively with the sequences of CMV subgroup II. The CP gene also showed homologies of 75%–97% in nucleotide and 77%–96% in amino acid with the CMV Indian isolates infecting various crops. On the basis of sequence homology, it was concluded that CMV-infecting geraniums in India belong to subgroup II.</p>

				<title>Age-related changes of structures in cerebellar cortex of cat</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0055-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We studied the structures of the cerebellar cortex of young adult and old cats for age-related changes, which were statistically analysed. Nissl staining was used to visualize the cortical neurons. The immunohistochemical method was used to display glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive (IR) astrocytes and neurofilament-immunoreactive (NF-IR) neurons. Under the microscope, the thickness of the cerebellar cortex was measured; and the density of neurons in all the layers as well as that of GFAP-IR cells in the granular layer was analysed. Compared with young adult cats, the thickness of the molecular layer and total cerebellar cortex was significantly decreased in old cats, and that of the granular layer increased. The density of neurons in each layer was significantly lower in old cats than in young adult ones. Astrocytes in old cats were significantly denser than in young adult ones, and accompanied by evident hypertrophy of the cell bodies and enhanced immunoreaction of GFAP substance. Purkinje cells (PCs) in old cats showed much fewer NF-IR dendrites than those in young adults. The above findings indicate a loss of neurons and decrease in the number of dendrites of the PCs in the aged cerebellar cortex, which might underlie the functional decline of afferent efficacy and information integration in the senescent cerebellum. An age-dependent enhancement of activity of the astrocytes may exert a protective effect on neurons in the aged cerebellum.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0061-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Essential metal ion homeostasis is based on regulated uptake of metal ions, both during its scarcity and abundance. <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> strain S4, a multimetal resistant bacterium, was employed to investigate Ni<sup>2+</sup> entry into cells. It was observed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> regulates the entry of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and by this plays a protective role to minimize Ni<sup>2+</sup> toxicity in this strain. This protection was evident in both growth as well as viability. Intracellular accumulation of Ni<sup>2+</sup> varied in accordance with Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the medium. It was hypothesized that Ni<sup>2+</sup> enters the cell using a broad Mg<sup>2+</sup> pump, i.e. the CorA system, as the CorA inhibitor, i.e. Co(III) Hex, also inhibits Ni<sup>2+</sup> uptake. This led to the inference that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-based protection was basically due to competitive inhibition of Ni<sup>2+</sup> uptake. We also show that Zn<sup>2+</sup> can further regulate the entry of Ni<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

				<title>Candidate genes for drought tolerance and improved productivity in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0069-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Candidate genes are sequenced genes of known biological action involved in the development or physiology of a trait. Twenty-one putative candidate genes were designed after an exhaustive search in the public databases along with an elaborate literature survey for candidate gene products and/or regulatory sequences associated with enhanced drought resistance. The downloaded sequences were then used to design primers considering the flanking sequences as well. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on 10 diverse cultivars that involved <i>Japonica, Indica</i> and local accessions, revealed 12 polymorphic candidate genes. Seven polymorphic candidate genes were then utilized to genotype 148 individuals of CT9993 &#215; IR62266 doubled haploid (DH) mapping population. The segregation data were tested for deviation from the expected Mendelian ratio (1:1) using a Chi-square test (&#60;1%). Based on this, four candidate genes were assessed to be significant and the remaining three, as non-significant. All the significant candidate genes were biased towards CT9993, the female parent in the DH mapping population. Single-marker analysis strongly associated ( &#60; 1%) them to different traits under both well-watered and low-moisture stress conditions. Two candidate genes, <i>EXP15</i> and <i>EXP13</i>, were found to be associated with root number and silicon content in the stem respectively, under both well-watered and low-moisture stress conditions.</p>

				<title>Lyriform slit sense organs on the pedipalps and spinnerets of spiders</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0075-0084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lyriform slits sense organs (LSSO) are a precise assembly of stress detecting cuticular slit sensilla found on the appendages of arachnids. While these structures on the legs of the wandering spider <i>Cupennius salei</i> are well studied in terms of morphology, function and contribution to behaviour, their distribution on pedipalps and spinnerets of spiders is not well explored. A study was therefore carried out to observe the distribution of LSSO on pedipalps and spinnerets of some spider species. Haplogyne spiders belonging to family <i>Pholcidae</i> have a simple complement of LSSOs represented by one or two LSSOs on their femur. The entelegyne spiders possess a complex assembly of LSSOs on the distal segments of their pedipalps. Various types of LSSOs are found on the pedipalps indicating a capacity for analysis of complex cuticular stress. It is suggested that the complexity of LSSOs on pedipalps of entelegyne spiders relates to courtship and spermatophore transfer and may help in reproductive isolation. Lack of LSSOs on the distal segments of pedipalps leads us to infer that unlike legs, pedipalps are less likely to receive vibratory input through their distal segments.</p>
					<p>Spinnerets have a relatively simple complement of LSSOs. One LSSO is found only on anterior spinnerets and it is a common feature observed among spiders, irrespective of the variations in web building behaviour. The orb-weaving araneid <i>Argiope pulchella</i>, however, has two LSSOs on the anterior spinneret. As non-web builders and orb weavers do not differ markedly in terms of LSSOs on the spinnerets and LSSOs are simple in nature (type A), it is likely that spinning and weaving are not largely regulated by sensory input from LSSOs on the spinnerets.</p>

				<title>Natural recovery of steppe vegetation on vehicle tracks in central Mongolia</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0085-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Steppe desertification due to vehicle travel is a severe environmental issue in Mongolia. We studied natural vegetation recovery on abandoned vehicle tracks in the central Mongolia steppe through vegetation surveys and stable isotopic techniques. The following issues were addressed:</p>
					<ol> 
						<li>invasion of pioneering plant species,</li>
						<li>alteration of soil surface features, and</li>
						<li>contribution of revegetated plants to soil organic matter (SOM).</li>
					</ol> 
					<p>The pioneering plant species that firstly invaded the abandoned tracks are those that could germinate, root and survive in the compacted track surface. <i>Salsola collina</i> is one of these candidate plants. Due to revegetation, soil surface hardness was reduced. With the improvement of surface microenvironmental conditions, other plants began to colonize and establish; concomitantly species richness and species diversity increased. Carbon isotope ratios of SOM at the top surface layer indicated that C<sub>4</sub>-derived carbon contributed more to SOM in the early phase of recovery and decreased with further recovery.</p>

				<title>Phylogenetic tests of distribution patterns in South Asia: towards an integrative approach</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0095-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The last four decades have seen an increasing integration of phylogenetics and biogeography. However, a dearth of phylogenetic studies has precluded such biogeographic analyses in South Asia until recently. Noting the increase in phylogenetic research and interest in phylogenetic biogeography in the region, we outline an integrative framework for studying taxon distribution patterns. While doing so, we pay particular attention to challenges posed by the complex geological and ecological history of the region, and the differences in distribution across taxonomic groups. We outline and compare three widely used phylogenetic biogeographic approaches: topology-based methods (TBMs), pattern-based methods (PBMs) and event-based methods (EBMs). TBMs lack a quantitative framework and utilize only part of the available phylogenetic information. Hence, they are mainly suited for preliminary enquiries. Both PBMs and EBMs have a quantitative framework, but we consider the latter to be particularly suited to the South Asian context since they consider multiple biogeographic processes explicitly, and can accommodate a reticulated history of areas. As an illustration, we present a biogeographic analysis of endemic Sri Lankan agamid lizards. The results provide insights into the relative importance of multiple processes and specific zones in the radiation of two speciose lizard clades.</p>

				<title>Record of Lower Gondwana megafloral assemblage from Lower Kamthi Formation of Ib River Coalfield, Orissa, India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0115-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent investigations carried out in the Ib River Coalfield, Mahanadi Master Basin, Orissa, identified some fossiliferous beds in the Lower Gondwana deposits. Two exposures of the Lower Kamthi Formation yielded diverse and abundant plant remains, which include <i>Neomariopteris, Vertebraria</i>, and a scale leaf along with 14 <i>Glossopteris</i> species otherwise mapped as Barren Measures and Upper Kamthi formations. <i>Glossopteris indica</i> dominates the flora (22.78%) followed by <i>G. communis</i> (17.72%) and <i>G. browniana</i> (13.92%). Based on megafloral assemblages, different beds exposed at Gopalpur and Laxamanpur Pahar are assigned here to the Lower Kamthi Formation (Late Permian). The floristic composition suggests that a warm and humid climate prevailed during the Late Permian. The status of the Kamthi Formation in the Ib River Coalfield has been redefined in the present study.</p>

				<title>A model for the dynamics of human weight cycling</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0129-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The resolution to lose weight by cognitive restraint of nutritional intake often leads to repeated bouts of weight loss and regain, a phenomenon known as weight cycling or ``yo-yo dieting”. A simple mathematical model for weight cycling is presented. The model is based on a feedback of psychological nature by which a subject decides to reduce dietary intake once a threshold weight is exceeded. The analysis of the model indicates that sustained oscillations in body weight occur in a parameter range bounded by critical values. Only outside this range can body weight reach a stable steady state. The model provides a theoretical framework that captures key facets of weight cycling and suggests ways to control the phenomenon. The view that weight cycling represents self-sustained oscillations has indeed specific implications. In dynamical terms, to bring weight cycling to an end, parameter values should change in such a way as to induce the transition of body weight from sustained oscillations around an unstable steady state to a stable steady state. Maintaining weight under a critical value should prevent weight cycling and allow body weight to stabilize below the oscillatory range.</p>

				<title>The ubiquitin-proteasome system</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0137-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 2004 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of protein ubiquitination has led to the recognition of cellular proteolysis as a central area of research in biology. Eukaryotic proteins targeted for degradation by this pathway are first ‘tagged’ by multimers of a protein known as ubiquitin and are later proteolyzed by a giant enzyme known as the proteasome. This article recounts the key observations that led to the discovery of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In addition, different aspects of proteasome biology are highlighted. Finally, some key roles of the UPS in different areas of biology and the use of inhibitors of this pathway as possible drug targets are discussed.</p>

				<page>0157-0165</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Survival of bacteria at low temperatures provokes scientific interest because of several reasons. Investigations in this area promise insight into one of the mysteries of life science – namely, how the machinery of life operates at extreme environments. Knowledge obtained from these studies is likely to be useful in controlling pathogenic bacteria, which survive and thrive in cold-stored food materials. The outcome of these studies may also help us to explore the possibilities of existence of life in distant frozen planets and their satellites.</p>

				<title>Looking back, looking beyond: revisiting the ethics of genome generation</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0167-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper will explore some of the ethical imperatives that have shaped strategic and policy frameworks for the use of new genetic technologies and how these play a role in shaping the nature of research and changing attitudes; with an attempt to conceptualize some theories of genetic determinism. I analyse why there is a need to put bioethical principles within a theoretical framework in the context of new technologies, and how, by doing so, their practical applications for agriculture, environment medicine and health care can be legitimized.</p>
					<p>There are several theories in favour of and against the use of genetic technologies that focus on genes and their role in our existence. In particular the theory of geneticisation is commonly debated. It highlights the conflicting interests of science, society and industry in harnessing genetic knowledge when the use of such knowledge could challenge ethical principles. Critics call it a `reductionist’ approach, based on arguments that are narrowed down to genes, often ignoring other factors including biological, social and moral ones. A parallel theory is that there is something special about genes, and it is this ``genetic exceptionalism” that creates hopes and myths. Either way, the challenging task is to develop a common ground for understanding the importance of ethical sensitivities.</p>
					<p>As research agendas become more complex, ethical paradigms will need to be more influential. New principles are needed to answer the complexities of ethical issues as complex technologies develop. This paper reflects on global ethical principles and the tensions between ethical principles in legitimizing genetic technologies at the social and governance level.</p>

				<title><i>Pleurotus sajor-caju</i> HSP100 complements a thermotolerance defect in <i>hsp104</i> mutant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0223-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A putative <i>Hsp100</i> gene was cloned from the fungus <i>Pleurotus sajor-caju</i>. mRNA expression studies demonstrated that this gene (designated <i>PsHsp100</i>) is highly induced by high temperature, induced less strongly by exposure to ethanol, and not induced by drought or salinity. Heat shock induction is detectable at 37&#176;C and reaches a maximum level at 42&#176;C. <i>PsHsp100</i> mRNAlevels sharply increased within 15 min of exposure to high temperature, and reached a maximum expression level at 2 h that was maintained for several hours. These results indicate that PsHsp100 could work at an early step in thermotolerance. To examine its function, <i>PsHsp100</i> was transformed into a temperature-sensitive <i>hsp104</i> deletion mutant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain to test the hypothesis that PsHSP100 is an protein that functions in thermotolerance. Overexpression of PsHSP100 complemented the thermotolerance defect of the <i>hsp104</i> mutant yeast, allowing them survive even at 50&#176;C for 4 h. These results indicate that PsHSP100 protein is functional as an HSP100 in yeast and could play an important role in thermotolerance in <i>P. sajor-caju</i>.</p>

				<title>Genetic transformation of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.) using cotyledonary node as explant and a promoterless <i>gus::npt</i>II fusion gene based vector</title>

				<page>0235-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have generated putative promoter tagged transgenic lines in <i>Arachis hypogaea</i> cv JL-24 using cotyledonary node (CN) as an explant and a promoterless <i>gus::npt</i>II bifunctional fusion gene mediated by <i>Agrobacterium</i> transformation. MS medium fortified with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) at 4 mg/l in combination with 0.1 mg/l 𝛼-napthaleneacetic acid (NAA) was the most effective out of the various BAP and NAA combinations tested in multiple shoot bud formation. Parameters enhancing genetic transformation viz. seedling age, <i>Agrobacterium</i> genetic background and co-cultivation periods were studied by using the binary vector p35SGUSINT. Genetic transformation with CN explants from 6-dayold seedlings co-cultivated with <i>Agrobacterium</i> GV2260 strain for 3 days resulted in high kanamycin resistant shoot induction percentage (45%); approximately 31% transformation frequency was achieved with p35S GUSINT in 𝛽-glucuronidase (GUS) assays. Among the <i>in vivo</i> GUS fusions studied with promoterless <i>gus::npt</i>II construct, GUS-positive sectors occupied 38% of the total transient GUS percentage. We have generated over 141 putative T<sub>0</sub> plants by using the promoterless construct and transferred them to the field. Among these, 82 plants survived well in the green house and 5 plants corresponding to 3.54% showed stable integration of the fusion gene as evidenced by GUS, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analyses. Twenty-four plants were positive for GUS showing either tissue-specific expression or blue spots in at least one plant part. The progeny of 15 T<sub>0</sub> plants indicated Mendelian inheritance pattern of segregation for single-copy integration. The tissue-specific GUS expression patterns were more or less similar in both T<sub>0</sub> and corresponding T<sub>1</sub> progeny plants. We present the differential patterns of GUS expression identified in the putative promoter-tagged transgenic lines in the present communication.</p>

				<title>The analysis of proteome changes in sunflower seeds induced by N<sup>+</sup> implantation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0247-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, the proteomic changes induced by N<sup>+</sup> ion implantation were investigated using a sunflower seed model by a two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis. To further understand the changes of total protein irradiated with N<sup>+</sup> ion, a proteomic analysis of N<sup>+</sup> ion implantation seeds was developed. Among approximately 369 total protein spots displayed in 2-D gels, eight specific proteins were found in non-implanted seeds while four proteins were found in implanted seeds. Six proteins were used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis, of which only two had been reported before. The proteins designated as No. 29 showed 23.4% homology to MADS-box transcriptional factor HAM59, while No. 279 protein had 23.20% identity to homeobox-leucine zipper protein HAHB-4. The analysis of proteome changes induced by N<sup>+</sup> implantation could provid a new clue to studing mutation mechanism of ion implantation. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the analysis of proteome changes induced by N<sup>+</sup> implantation in sunflower seeds.</p>

				<title>Overexpression of <i>GbERF</i> confers alteration of ethylene-responsive gene expression and enhanced resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> in transgenic tobacco</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0255-0263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>GbERF belongs to the ERF (ethylene responsive factor) family of transcription factors and regulates the GCC-box containing pathogen-related (PR) genes in the ethylene signal transduction pathway. To study the function of GbERF in the process of biotic stress, transgenic tobacco plants expressing <i>GbERF</i> were generated. Overexpression of <i>GbERF</i> did not change transgenic plant’s phenotype and endogenous ethylene level. However, the expression profile of some ethylene-inducible GCC-box and non-GCC-box containing genes was altered, such as <i>PR1b, PR2, PR3, PR4, Osmotin, CHN50</i>, ACC oxidase and ACC synthase genes. These data indicate that the cotton GbERF could act as a transcriptional activator or repressor to regulate the differential expression of ethylene-inducible genes via GCC and non-GCC <i>cis</i>-elements. Moreover, the constitutive expression of <i>GbERF</i> in transgenic tobacco enhanced the plant’s resistance to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tabaci</i> infection. In conclusion, <i>GbERF</i> mediates the expression of a wide array of <i>PR</i> and ethylene-responsive genes and plays an important role in the plant’s response to biotic stress.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the parent <i>Nostoc muscorum</i> an active proline oxidase enzyme is required to assimilate exogenous proline as a fixed nitrogen source. Cyanobacterial mutants, resistant to growth inhibitory action of proline analogue L-azetidine-2-carboxylate (Ac-R), were deficient in proline oxidase activity, and were over-accumulators of proline. Proline over-accumulation, resulting either from mutational acquisition of the Ac-R phenotype, or from salinity-induced uptake of exogenous proline, confirmed enhanced salinity/osmotic tolerance in the mutant strain. The nitrogenase activity and photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution of the parent were sensitive to both salinity as well as osmotic stresses than of Ac-R mutant strain. In addition, the mutation to Ac-resistant phenotype showed no alteration in salinity inducible potassium transport system in the cyanobacterium</p>

				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurement of rates of <i>in vivo</i> substrate oxidation such as that of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, are based on tracer (<sup>14</sup>C or <sup>13</sup>C) data, and often depend on the isotopic content of expired CO<sub>2</sub>. The recovery of tracer-labelled CO<sub>2</sub> generated from the oxidation of <sup>13</sup>C labelled substrates may not be 100% over short term. This can lead to underestimation of oxidation rate of substrates, and consequently a correction for the incomplete recovery of tracer has to be applied by the determination of the recovery of <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> in the breath during tracer bicarbonate infusions. We have studied the recovery of tracer-labelled bicarbonate using a bolus administration model, and further characterized kinetics of bicarbonate using a three-compartment model, to assess which compartmental fluxes changed during the change from a fasted state to fed state. Recovery of bicarbonate was lower at 69% and 67% (fasted and fed state) than the value of 71% and 74% found during earlier longer term of continuous infusions. During feeding, there was a 20-fold increase in the flux of bicarbonate between the central compartment and the compartment that was equivalent to the viscera. This study shows that the difference between the fasted and fed state recovery of tracer bicarbonate similar to that obtained with continuous infusions, and that bicarbonate fluxes show large changes between different compartments in the body depending on metabolic state.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes in eubacteria: a new role of initiation factor 3</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0281-0289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ribosome recycling is a process which dissociates the post-termination complexes (post-TC) consisting of mRNA-bound ribosomes harbouring deacylated tRNA(s). Ribosome recycling factor (RRF), and elongation factor G (EFG) participate in this crucial process to free the ribosomal subunits for a new round of translation. We discuss the overall pathway of ribosome recycling in eubacteria with especial reference to the important role of the initiation factor 3 (IF3) in this process. Depending on the step(s) at which IF3 function is implicated, three models have been proposed. In model 1, RRF and EFG dissociate the post-TCs into the 50S and 30S subunits, mRNA and tRNA(s). In this model, IF3, which binds to the 30S subunit, merely keeps the dissociated subunits apart by its anti-association activity. In model 2, RRF and EFG separate the 50S subunit from the post-TC. IF3 then dissociates the remaining complex of mRNA, tRNA and the 30S subunit, and keeps the ribosomal subunits apart from each other. However, in model 3, both the genetic and biochemical evidence support a more active role for IF3 even at the step of dissociation of the post-TC by RRF and EFG into the 50S and 30S subunits.</p>

				<title>Characterization of the <i>Helicoverpa assulta</i> nucleopolyhedrovirus genome and sequence analysis of the polyhedrin gene region</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0329-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A local strain of <i>Helicoverpa assulta</i> nucleopolyhedrovirus (HasNPV) was isolated from infected <i>H. assulta</i> larvae in Korea. Restriction endonuclease fragment analysis, using 4 restriction enzymes, estimated that the total genome size of HasNPV is about 138 kb. A degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set for the polyhedrin gene successfully amplified the partial polyhedrin gene of HasNPV. The sequencing results showed that the about 430 bp PCR product was a fragment of the corresponding polyhedrin gene. Using HasNPV partial predicted polyhedrin to probe the Southern blots, we identified the location of the polyhedrin gene within the 6 kb <i>Eco</i>RI, 15 kb <i>Nco</i>I, 20 kb <i>Xho</i>I, 17 kb <i>Bgl</i>II and 3 kb <i>Cla</i>I fragments, respectively. The 3 kb <i>Cla</i>I fragment was cloned and the nucleotide sequences of the polyhedrin coding region and its flaking regions were determined. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated the presence of an open reading frame of 735 nucleotides which could encode 245 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa. The nucleotide sequences within the coding region of HasNPV polyhedrin shared 73.7% identity with the polyhedrin gene from <i>Autographa californica</i> NPV but were most closely related to <i>Helicoverpa</i> and <i>Heliothis</i> species NPVs with over 99% sequence identity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chickpea is the world’s third most important pulse crop and India produces 75% of the world’s supply. Chickpea seeds are attacked by <i>Callosobruchus maculatus</i> and <i>C. chinensis</i> which cause extensive damage. The 𝛼-amylase inhibitor gene isolated from <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> seeds was introduced into chickpea cultivar K850 through <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. A total of 288 kanamycin resistant plants were regenerated. Only 0.3% of these were true transformants. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Southern hybridization confirmed the presence of 4.9 kb 𝛼-amylase inhibitor gene in the transformed plants. Western blot confirmed the presence of 𝛼-amylase inhibitor protein. The results of bioassay study revealed a significant reduction in the survival rate of bruchid weevil <i>C. maculatus</i> reared on transgenic chickpea seeds. All the transgenic plants exhibited a segregation ratio of 3:1.</p>

				<title>Modulation of glucose uptake in adipose tissue by nitric oxide-generating compounds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0347-0354</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is increasing evidence that endogenous nitric oxide (NO) influences adipogenesis, lipolysis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. We investigated the effect of NO released from S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes of normoglycaemic and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. GSNO and SNAP at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mM brought about a concentration-dependent increase in basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in adipocytes of normoglycaemic and STZ-induced diabetic rats. SNAP at 1.0 mM significantly elevated basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake (115.8 &#177; 10.4%) compared with GSNO at the same concentration (116.1 &#177; 9.4%; 𝑃  &#60; 0.05) in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Conversely, SNAP at concentrations of 10 mM and 20 mM significantly decreased basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 50.0 &#177; 4.5% and 61.5 &#177; 7.2% respectively in adipocytes of STZ-induced diabetic rats (𝑃  &#60; 0.05). GSNO at concentrations of 10 mM and 20 mM also significantly decreased basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 50.8 &#177; 6.4% and 55.2 &#177; 7.8% respectively in adipocytes of STZ-induced diabetic rats (𝑃 &#60; 0.05). These observations indicate that NO released from GSNO and SNAP at 1 mM or less stimulates basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and at concentrations of 10 mM and 20 mM inhibits basal glucose uptake. The additive effect of GSNO or SNAP, and insulin observed in this study could be due to different mechanisms and warrants further investigation.</p>

				<title>The effect of some osmolytes on the activity and stability of mushroom tyrosinase</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0355-0362</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The thermodynamical stability and remained activity of mushroom tyrosinase (MT) from <i>Agaricus bisporus</i> in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, stored at two temperatures of 4 and 40&#176;C were investigated in the presence of three different amino acids (His, Phe and Asp) and also trehalose as osmolytes, for comparing with the results obtained in the absence of any additive. Kinetics of inactivation obeye the first order law. Inactivation rate constant (k<sub>inact</sub>) value is the best parameter describing effect of osmolytes on kinetic stability of the enzyme. Trehalose and His have the smallest value of k<sub>inact</sub> (0.7&#215;10<sup>–4</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) in comparison with their absence (2.5&#215;10<sup>–4</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). Moreover, to obtain effect of these four osmolytes on thermodynamical stability of the enzyme, protein denaturation by dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) and thermal scanning was investigated. Sigmoidal denaturation curves were analysed according to the two states model of Pace theory to find the Gibbs free energy change of denaturation process in aqueous solution at room temperature, as a very good thermodynamic criterion indicating stability of the protein. Although His, Phe and Asp induced constriction of MT tertiary structure, its secondary structure had not any change and the result was a chemical and thermal stabilization of MT. The enzyme shows a proper coincidence of thermodyanamic and structural changes with the presence of trehalose. Thus, among the four osmolytes, trehalose is an exceptional protein stabilizer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A novel, disposable-bag bioreactor system that uses wave action for mixing and transferring oxygen was evaluated for BHK 21 C13 cell line growth and Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV) production. Growth kinetics of BHK 21 C13 cells in the wave bioreactor during 3-day period were determined. At the end of the 3-day culture period and cell density of 1.82 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>–1</sup>, the reactor was inoculated with 9 ml of gE- Bartha K-61 strain ADV suspension (10<sup>5.9</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) with multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. After a 144 h incubation period, 400 ml of ADV harvest was obtained with titre of 10<sup>7.0</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> ml<sup>–1</sup>, which corresponds to 40,000 doses of vaccine against AD. In conclusion, the results obtained with the wave bioreactor using BHK 21 C13 cells showed that this system can be considered as suitable for ADV or BHK 21 C13 cell biomass production.</p>

				<title>Dominance hierarchy and social grooming in female lion-tailed macaques (<i>Macaca silenus</i>) in the Western Ghats, India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0369-0377</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article reports the structure of dominance and its relationship with social grooming in wild lion-tailed macaque females. The strength of dominance hierarchy was 0.79 on a scale of 0 to 1 indicating a moderate linearity in the ranking system. Dominance scores were converted into an ordinal as well as an interval scale. Grooming scores were also converted into interval scales using standard scores. Grooming received and grooming given correlated positively and negatively respectively with dominance ranks indicating that high ranking females received more and gave less grooming. Grooming was also positively related to encounter rates for dyads of females. More grooming among adjacent ranks, and grooming being more reciprocal, occurred only in the case of dominant females. The grooming patterns, therefore, appeared to be more of despotic than egalitarian nature. While ranking macaques into different Grades of social systems ranging from despotic to egalitarian, Thierry (2004) has placed lion-tailed macaques in Grade 3 corresponding to the ‘relaxed’ social system. Our results indicate that the grooming and dominance relationships in this species are more despotic, and hence, the Grade for this species requires to be shifted toward 2 or 1.</p>

				<title>The sperm of Hylodinae species (Anura, Leptodactylidae): Ultrastructural characteristics and their relevance to interspecific taxonomic relationships</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0379-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hylodinae leptodactylids (<i>sensu</i> Lynch 1971) form a group of diurnal frogs, which is hypothesized on the basis of morphological traits to be the closest relatives of the dendrobatid frogs. Our study describes ultrastructural characteristics of sperm from three hylodine species (<i>Hylodes phyllodes, Crossodactylus</i> sp. n. and <i>Megaelosia massarti</i>) to reassess the intergeneric relationships within the Hylodinae, as well as the supposed relationship between the Hylodinae and Dendrobatidae. The ultrastructure of the sperm is very similar among the three species and is indicative of its conserved nature within the Hylodinae. The structure of the acrosomal complex was very similar to that of other leptodactylid species, to most of the remaining species included in the Bufonoidea lineage, and also to that observed in the dendrobatid species examined so far. Since such a structure has been considered a plesiomorphic trait, it contributes little to our understanding of the relationships between the Hylodinae and Dendrobatidae. The flagellar apparatus of <i>Crossodactylus</i> sp. n. is very similar to that of most leptodactylids. The sperm of <i>Megaelosia massarti</i> and <i>Hylodes phyllodes</i> display a distinctive condition in their axial and juxtaxonemal fibers. This distinctive flagellar condition expands the already known variability in sperm structure within the Leptodactylidae.</p>

				<title>The reactive oxygen species network pathways: an essential prerequisite for perception of pathogen attack and the acquired disease resistance in plants</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0389-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Availability of complete Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome sequences, together with molecular recourses of functional genomics and proteomics have revolutionized our understanding of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling network mediating disease resistance in plants. So far, ROS have been associated with aging, cellular and molecular alteration in animal and plant cells. Recently, concluding evidences suggest that ROS network is essential to induce disease resistance and even to mediate resistance to multiple stresses in plants. ROS are obligatory by-products emerging as a result of normal metabolic reactions. They have the potential to be both beneficial and harmful to cellular metabolism. Their dual effects on metabolic reactions are dosage specific. In this review we focus our attention on cellular ROS level to trigger beneficial effects on plant cells responding to pathogen attack. By exploring the research related contributions coupled with data of targeted gene disruption, and RNA interference approaches, we show here that ROS are ubiquitous molecules of redox-pathways that play a crucial role in plant defence mechanism. The molecular prerequisites of ROS network to activate plant defence system in response to pathogen infections are here underlined. Bioinformatic tools are now available to scientists for high throughput analysis of cellular metabolisms. These tools are used to illustrate crucial ROS-related genes that are involved in the defence mechanism of plants. The review describes also the emerging findings of ROS network pathways to modulate multiple stress resistance in plants.</p>

				<title>Laminopathies: Multiple disorders arising from defects in nuclear architecture</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0405-0421</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lamins are the major structural proteins of the nucleus in an animal cell. In addition to being essential for nuclear integrity and assembly, lamins are involved in the organization of nuclear processes such as DNA replication, transcription and repair. Mutations in the human lamin A gene lead to highly debilitating genetic disorders that primarily affect muscle, adipose, bone or neuronal tissues and also cause premature ageing syndromes. Mutant lamins alter nuclear integrity and hinder signalling pathways involved in muscle differentiation and adipocyte differentiation, suggesting tissue-specific roles for lamins. Furthermore, cells expressing mutant lamins are impaired in their response to DNA damaging agents. Recent reports indicate that certain lamin mutations act in a dominant negative manner to cause nuclear defects and cellular toxicity, and suggest a possible role for aberrant lamins in normal ageing processes.</p>

				<page>0423-0434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Depression is the major psychiatric ailment of our times, afflicting &#8764;20% of the population. Despite its prevalence, the pathophysiology of this complex disorder is not well understood. In addition, although antidepressants have been in existence for the past several decades, the mechanisms that underlie their therapeutic effects remain elusive. Building evidence implicates a role for the plasticity of specific neuro-circuitry in both the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Damage to limbic regions is thought to contribute to the etiology of depression and antidepressants have been reported to reverse such damage and promote adaptive plasticity. The molecular pathways that contribute to the damage associated with depression and antidepressant-mediated plasticity are a major focus of scientific enquiry. The transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are targets of diverse classes of antidepressants and are known to be regulated in animal models and in patients suffering from depression. Given their role in neuronal plasticity, CREB and BDNF have emerged as molecules that may play an important role in modulating mood. The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of CREB and BDNF in depression and as targets/mediators of antidepressant action.</p>

				<title><i>Pleurotus sajor-caju</i> HSP100 complements a thermotolerance defect in <i>hsp104</i> mutant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i></title>

				<page>0435-0435</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A putative <i>Hsp100</i> gene was cloned from the fungus <i>Pleurotus sajor-caju</i>. mRNA expression studies demonstrated that this gene (designated <i>PsHsp100</i>) is highly induced by high temperature, induced less strongly by exposure to ethanol, and not induced by drought or salinity. Heat shock induction is detectable at 37&#176;C and reaches a maximum level at 42&#176;C. <i>PsHsp100</i> mRNAlevels sharply increased within 15 min of exposure to high temperature, and reached a maximum expression level at 2 h that was maintained for several hours. These results indicate that PsHsp100 could work at an early step in thermotolerance. To examine its function, <i>PsHsp100</i> was transformed into a temperature-sensitive <i>hsp104</i> deletion mutant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain to test the hypothesis that PsHSP100 is an protein that functions in thermotolerance. Overexpression of PsHSP100 complemented the thermotolerance defect of the <i>hsp104</i> mutant yeast, allowing them survive even at 50&#176;C for 4 h. These results indicate that PsHSP100 protein is functional as an HSP100 in yeast and could play an important role in thermotolerance in <i>P. sajor-caju</i>.</p>

				<title>Cortical activation during finger tapping in thyroid dysfunction: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0543-0550</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thyroid dysfunction is associated with attention deficit and impairment of the motor system (muscle weakness and fatigue). This paper investigates possible motor function deficit in thyroid patients, compared to the controls. Functional MRI studies (fMRI) were carried out in five hypo and five hyperthyroid patients and six healthy volunteers. Whole brain imaging was performed using echo planar imaging (EPI) technique, on a 1.5T whole body MR system (Siemens Magnetom Vision). The task paradigm consisted of 8 cycles of active and reference phases of 6 measurements each, with right index finger tapping at a rate of 120 taps/min. Post-processing was performed using statistical parametric mapping on a voxel-by-voxel basis using SPM99. Clusters of activation were found in the contralateral hemisphere in primary somatomotor area (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), somatosensory, auditory receptive and integration areas, inferior temporal lobe, thalamus and cerebellum. Increased clusters of activation were observed in M1 in thyroid subjects as compared to controls and with bilateral activation of the primary motor cortex in two hyperthyroid patients. The results are explained in terms of increased functional demands in thyroid patients compared to volunteers for the execution of the same task.</p>

				<title>Dynamic light scattering study of peanut agglutinin: Size, shape and urea denaturation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0551-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Peanut agglutinin (PNA) is a homotetrameric protein with a unique open quaternary structure. PNA shows non-two state profile in chaotrope induced denaturation. It passes through a monomeric molten globule like state before complete denaturation (Reddy <i>et al</i> 1999). This denaturation profile is associated with the change in hydrodynamic radius of the native protein. Though the molten globule-like state is monomeric in nature it expands in size due to partial denaturation. The size and shape of the native PNA as well as the change in hydrodynamic radius of the protein during denaturation has been studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The generation of two species is evident from the profile of hydrodynamic radii. This study also reveals the extent of compactness of the intermediate state.</p>

					<p>Pol 𝜁, Pol 𝜂, Pol 𝜄, Pol 𝜅 and Rev1 are specialized DNA polymerases that are able to synthesize DNA across a damaged template. DNA synthesis by such translesion polymerases can be mutagenic due to the miscoding nature of most damaged nucleotides. In fact, many mutational and hypermutational processes in systems ranging from yeast to mammals have been traced to the activity of such polymerases. We show however, that the translesion polymerases are dispensable for repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) in <i>Neurospora crassa</i>. Additionally, we demonstrate that the <i>upr-1</i> gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of Pol 𝜁, is a highly polymorphic locus in Neurospora.</p>

				<title>Microarray analysis of adipose tissue gene expression profiles between two chicken breeds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0565-0573</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chicken is an important model organism that bridges the evolutionary gap between mammals and other vertebrates and provides a major protein source from meat and eggs throughout the world. Excessive accumulation of lipids in the adipose tissue is one of the main problems faced by the broiler industry nowadays. In order to visualize the mechanisms involved in the gene expression and regulation of lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, cDNA microarray containing 9 024 cDNA was used to construct gene expression profile and screen differentially expressed genes in adipose tissue between broilers and layers of 10 wk of age. Sixty-seven differentially expressed sequences were screened out, and 42 genes were found when blasted with the GenBank database. These genes are mainly related to lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, transcription and splicing factor, protein synthesis and degradation. The remained 25 sequences had no annotation available in the GenBank database. Furthermore, Northern blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR were developed to confirm 4 differentially expressed genes screened by cDNA microarray, and it showed great consistency between the microarray data and Northern blot results or semi-quantitative RT-PCR results. The present study will be helpful for clarifying the molecular mechanism of obesity in chickens.</p>

				<title>Vitamin C improves basal metabolic rate and lipid profile in alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus in rats</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0575-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multi-factorial disease which is characterized by hyperglycaemia, lipoprotein abnormalities and oxidative stress. This study evaluated effect of oral vitamin C administration on basal metabolic rate and lipid profile of alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Vitamin C was administered at 200 mg/kg body wt. by gavage for four weeks to diabetic rats after which the resting metabolic rate and plasma lipid profile was determined. The results showed that vitamin C administration significantly (𝑃 &#60; 0.01) reduced the resting metabolic rate in diabetic rats; and also lowered plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These results suggest that the administration of vitamin C in this model of established diabetes mellitus might be beneficial for the restoration of basal metabolic rate and improvement of lipid profile. This may at least in part reduce the risk of cardiovascular events seen in diabetes mellitus.</p>

				<title>Effect of a novel insulinotropic agent, succinic acid monoethyl ester, on lipids and lipoproteins levels in rats with streptozotocin-nicotinamideinduced type 2 diabetes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0581-0587</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the effect of succinic acid monoethyl ester (EMS) on the pattern of lipids and lipoproteins in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type 2 diabetes was investigated. Type 2 diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by single intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 45 mg/kg streptozotocin, 15 min after the i.p administration of 110 mg/kg body weight of nicotinamide. The carboxylic nutrient EMS was administered intraperitonially at a dose of 8 𝜇mol/g body weight for 30 days. At the end of experimental period, the effect of EMS on plasma glucose, insulin, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and hydroperoxide (HP) and serum triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), free fatty acids (FFA), total cholesterol (TC), very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and the percentage of antiatherogenic index (AAI) (ratio of HDL-C to total cholesterol) were studied. Administration of EMS to diabetic rats resulted in a significant reduction in the elevated levels of plasma glucose, TBARS and hydroperoxides as well as TG, PL, FFA, TC, VLDL-C and LDC-C levels. The decreased plasma insulin and serum HDL-C and percentage of AAI in diabetic rats were also reversed towards near normal. The effect produced by EMS was compared with metformin, a reference drug. The results indicates that the administration of EMS and metformin to nicotinamide-streptozotocin diabetic rats normalized plasma glucose, insulin concentrations and caused marked improvement in altered lipids, lipoprotein and lipid peroxidation markers during diabetes. Our results show the antihyperlipidemic properties of EMS and metformin in addition to its antidiabetic action. Moreover, the antihyperlipidemic effect could represent a protective mechanism against the development of atherosclerosis.</p>

				<title>Cell volume regulation in the perfused liver of a freshwater air-breathing catfish <i>Clarias batrachus</i> under aniso-osmotic conditions: Roles of inorganic ions and taurine</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0589-0598</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The roles of various inorganic ions and taurine, an organic osmolyte, in cell volume regulation were investigated in the perfused liver of a freshwater air-breathing catfish <i>Clarias batrachus</i> under aniso-osmotic conditions. There was a transient increase and decrease of liver cell volume following hypotonic (–80 mOsmol/l) and hypertonic (+80 mOsmol/l) exposures, respectively, which gradually decreased/increased near to the control level due to release/uptake of water within a period of 25–30 min. Liver volume decrease was accompanied by enhanced efflux of K<sup>+</sup> (9.45 &#177; 0.54 𝜇mol/g liver) due to activation of Ba<sup>2+</sup>- and quinidine-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel, and to a lesser extent due to enhanced efflux of Cl<sup>¯</sup> (4.35 &#177; 0.25 𝜇mol/g liver) and Na<sup>+</sup> (3.68 &#177; 0.37 𝜇mol/g liver). Conversely, upon hypertonic exposure, there was amiloride- and ouabain-sensitive uptake of K<sup>+</sup> (9.78 &#177; 0.65 𝜇mol/g liver), and also Cl<sup>¯</sup> (3.72 &#177; 0.25 𝜇mol/g liver). The alkalization/acidification of the liver effluents under hypo-/hypertonicity was mainly due to movement of various ions during volume regulatory processes. Taurine, an important organic osmolyte, appears also to play a very important role in hepatocyte cell volume regulation in the walking catfish as evidenced by the fact that hypo- and hyper-osmolarity caused transient efflux (5.68 &#177; 0.38 𝜇mol/g liver) and uptake (6.38 &#177; 0.45 𝜇mol/g liver) of taurine, respectively. The taurine efflux was sensitive to 4,4&#8242;-di-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2&#8242;-disulphonic acid (DIDS, an anion channel blocker), but the uptake was insensitive to DIDS, thus indicating that the release and uptake of taurine during volume regulatory processes are unidirectional. Although the liver of walking catfish possesses the RVD and RVI mechanisms, it is to be noted that liver cells remain partly swollen and shrunken during anisotonic exposures, thereby possibly causing various volume-sensitive metabolic changes in the liver as reported earlier.</p>

				<title>Potential application of urea-derived herbicides as cytokinins in plant tissue culture</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0599-0605</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Various urea-derived herbicides and different cytokinin analogues were used to determine their effects on callusing response and shoot regenerating capacity of alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) and Coleus (<i>Coleus forskohlii</i> Briq.). The herbicides monuron and diuron evoked profuse callusing response from Coleus leaf segments and alfalfa petiole explants on Murashige and Skoog medium. Shoot regeneration by monuron (2.0 mg/l) showed a maximum of 3 multiple shoots both in alfalfa and Coleus with a frequency of 92% and 75%, respectively. Whereas diuron (0.5 mg/l) showed a high frequency of shoot regeneration (89%) with a mean number of 5 shoots in alfalfa, in <i>C. forskohlii</i>, the frequency of regeneration was 90% with a mean number of 6 shoots. Diuron with two chloride groups in the phenyl ring showed significantly higher cytokinin-like activity than single chloride substitution monuron. This study demonstrates the potential use of monuron and diuron as cytokinins in plant tissue culture.</p>

				<title>Influence of jasmonic acid as potential activator of induced resistance against Karnal bunt in developing spikes of wheat</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0607-0616</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Induction of defense response against Karnal bunt (KB) by suppressing the pathogenesis was observed upon exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) as evident from decrease in the coefficient of infection and overall response value in both susceptible and resistant varieties of wheat. The ultra-structural changes during disease progression showed the signs of programmed cell death (PCD). However, JA strengthened the defense barrier by enhancing the lignifications of cell walls as observed in spikes of both varieties by histochemical analysis. Compared to the plants inoculated with pathogen alone, plants of resistant line (RJP) first treated with JA followed by inoculation with pathogen showed more lignifications and extracellular deposition of other metabolites on cells, which is supposed to prevent mycelial invasions. Contrary to this, susceptible (SJP) lines also showed lignifications but the invasion was more compared to resistant line. Induction of protease activity was higher in resistant variety than its corresponding susceptible variety. The protease activity induced during the colonization of the pathogen and its proliferation inside the host system gets inhibited by JA treatment as demonstrated by the quantitative and in-gel protease assay. The results indicate the role of JA signalling in inhibiting the proteases due to expression of certain protease inhibitor genes. SDS-PAGE analysis shows differential gene expression through induction and/or suppression of different proteins in wheat spikes of resistant and susceptible varieties under the influence of JA. Thus, exogenously applied JA provides the conditioning effect prior to the challenge of infection and induces defense against KB probably by maintaining a critical balance between proteases and protease inhibitors and/or coordinating induction of different families of new proteins.</p>

				<title>Combinative effects of a bacterial type-III effector and a biocontrol bacterium on rice growth and disease resistance</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0617-0627</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Expression of HpaG<sub>Xoo</sub>, a bacterial type-III effector, in transgenic plants induces disease resistance. Resistance also can be elicited by biocontrol bacteria. In both cases, plant growth is often promoted. Here we address whether biocontrol bacteria and HpaG<sub>Xoo</sub> can act together to provide better results in crop improvement. We studied effects of <i>Pseudomonas cepacia</i> on the rice variety R109 and the <i>hpaG</i><sub><i>Xoo</i></sub>-expressing rice line HER1. Compared to R109, HER1 showed increased growth, grain yield, and defense responses toward diseases and salinity stress. Colonization of roots by <i>P. cepacia</i> caused 20% and 13% increase, in contrast to controls, in root growth of R109 and HER1. Growth of leaves and stems also increased in R109 but that of HER1 was inhibited. When <i>P. cepacia</i>  colonization was subsequent to plant inoculation with <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, a pathogen that causes sheath blight, the disease was less severe than controls in both R109 and HER1; HER1, nevertheless, was more resistant, suggesting that <i>P. cepacia</i> and HpaG<sub>Xoo</sub> cooperate in inducing disease resistance. Several genes that critically regulate growth and defense behaved differentially in HER1 and R109 while responding to <i>P. cepacia</i>. In R109 leaves, the <i>OsARF1</i> gene, which regulates plant growth, was expressed in consistence with growth promotion by <i>P. cepacia</i>. Inversely, <i>OsARF1</i> expression was coincident with inhibition in growth of HER1 leaves. In both plants, the expression of <i>OsEXP1</i>, which encodes an expansin protein involved in plant growth, was concomitant with growth promotion in leaves instead of roots, in response to <i>P. cepacia</i>. We also studied <i>OsMAPK</i>, a gene that encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase and controls defense responses toward salinity and infection by pathogens in rice. In response to <i>P. cepacia</i>, an early expression of <i>OsMAPK</i> was coincident with R109 resistance to the disease, while HER1 expressed the gene similarly whether <i>P. cepacia</i> was present or not. Evidently, <i>P. cepacia</i> and G<sub>Xoo</sub>-gene mediated resistance may act differently in rice growth and resistance. Whereas combinative effects of <i>P. cepacia</i> and HpaG<sub>Xoo</sub> in disease resistance have a great potential in agricultural use, it is interesting to study mechanisms that underlie interactions involving biocontrol bacteria, type-III effectors and pathogens.</p>

				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0629-0637</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spontaneous intercellular chromatin migration/cytomixis was observed to occur in the pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the <i>Chlorophytum comosum</i> for the first time. The migration through cytomictic channels was more pronounced in meiosis-I and very rare in meiosis-II. The process was associated with erratic meiosis, which was characterized by defects in chromosome organization and segregation. Cytomixis was more intense in the month of April than in July and consequently the frequency of meiotic irregularities was much more pronounced during the month of April. As a consequence of abnormal meiosis, fertility was drastically reduced resulting in meager seed efficiency of 17% only. Recombination system also does not guarantee the release of sufficient variability. We view the phenomenon of cytomixis as genetically controlled mechanism involving meiotic genes and operating through signal transduction pathway triggered by the environmental stimuli. The evolutionary significance and tenable hypothesis in the backdrop of existing literature is also proposed.</p>

				<title>Nitrogen fixation in lichens is important for improved rock weathering</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0639-0643</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is known that cyanobacteria in cyanolichens fix nitrogen for their nutrition. However, specific uses of the fixed nitrogen have not been examined. The present study shows experimentally that a mutualistic interaction between a heterotrophic N<sub>2</sub> fixer and lichen fungi in the presence of a carbon source can contribute to enhanced release of organic acids, leading to improved solubilization of the mineral substrate. Three lichen fungi were isolated from <i>Xanthoparmelia mexicana</i>, a foliose lichen, and they were cultured separately or with a heterotrophic N<sub>2</sub> fixer in nutrient broth media in the presence of a mineral substrate. Cells of the N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria attached to the mycelial mats of all fungi, forming biofilms. All biofilms showed higher solubilizations of the substrate than cultures of their fungi alone. This finding has bearing on the significance of the origin and existence of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing activity in the evolution of lichen symbiosis. Further, our results may explain why there are N<sub>2</sub>-fixing photobionts even in the presence of non-fixing photobionts (green algae) in some remarkable lichens such as <i>Placopsis gelida</i>. Our study sheds doubt on the idea that the establishment of terrestrial eukaryotes was possible only through the association between a fungus and a phototroph.</p>

				<title>Interactions among endophytic bacteria and fungi: effects and potentials</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0645-0650</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plants benefit extensively by harbouring endophytic microbes. They promote plant growth and confer enhanced resistance to various pathogens. However, the way the interactions among endophytes influence the plant productivity has not been explained. Present study experimentally showed that endophytes isolated from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) used as the test plant produced two types of interactions; biofilms (bacteria attached to mycelia) and mixed cultures with no such attachments. Acidity, as measured by pH in cultures with biofilms was higher than that of fungi alone, bacteria alone or the mixed cultures. Production of indoleacetic acid like substances (IAAS) of biofilms was higher than that of mixed cultures, fungi or bacteria. Bacteria and fungi produced higher quantities of IAAS than mixed cultures. In mixed cultures, the potential of IAAS production of resident microbes was reduced considerably. There was a negative relationship between IAAS and pH of the biofilms, indicating that IAAS was the main contributor to the acidity. However, such a relationship was not observed in mixed cultures. Microbial acid production is important for suppressing plant pathogens. Thus the biofilm formation in endophytic environment seems to be very important for healthy and improved plant growth. However, it is unlikely that an interaction among endophytes takes place naturally in the endophytic environment, due to physical barriers of plant tissues. Further, critical cell density dependant quorum sensing that leads to biofilm formation may not occur in the endophytic environment as there is a limited space. As such <i>in vitro</i> production and application of beneficial biofilmed inocula of endophytes are important for improved plant production in any agro-ecosystem. The conventional practice of plant inoculation with monocultures or mixed cultures of effective microbes may not give the highest microbial effect, which may only be achieved by biofilm formation.</p>

				<title>Patterns of tree growth in relation to environmental variability in the tropical dry deciduous forest at Mudumalai, southern India</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0651-0669</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tree diameter growth is sensitive to environmental fluctuations and tropical dry forests experience high seasonal and inter-annual environmental variation. Tree growth rates in a large permanent plot at Mudumalai, southern India, were examined for the influences of rainfall and three intrinsic factors (size, species and growth form) during three 4-year intervals over the period 1988–2000.</p>
					<p>Most trees had lowest growth during the second interval when rainfall was lowest, and skewness and kurtosis of growth distributions were reduced during this interval. Tree diameter generally explained &#60; 10% of growth variation and had less influence on growth than species identity or time interval. Intraspecific variation was high, yet species identity accounted for up to 16% of growth variation in the community. There were no consistent differences between canopy and understory tree growth rates; however, a few subgroups of species may potentially represent canopy and understory growth guilds. Environmentally-induced temporal variations in growth generally did not reduce the odds of subsequent survival.</p>
					<p>Growth rates appear to be strongly influenced by species identity and environmental variability in the Mudumalai dry forest. Understanding and predicting vegetation dynamics in the dry tropics thus also requires information on temporal variability in local climate.</p>

				<title>On the conspecificity of <i>Anopheles fluviatilis</i> species S with <i>Anopheles minimus</i> species C</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0671-0677</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Anopheles fluviatilis</i> and <i>An. minimus</i> complexes, each comprising of at least three sibling species, are closely related and important malaria vectors in Oriental Region. Recently <i>An. fluviatilis</i> species S, which is a highly efficient malaria vector in India, has been made conspecific with <i>An. minimus</i> species C (senior synonym) on the basis of homology in 335 base pair nucleotide sequence of D3 domain of 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). We examined the conspecificity of these two nominal species by obtaining and analysing the DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal loci internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and D2-D3 domain of 28S rDNA (28S-D2/D3) from those of <i>An. fluviatilis</i> S and <i>An. minimus</i> C. We found that the sequences of <i>An. fluviatilis</i> S are appreciably different from those of <i>An. minimus</i> C with pair-wise distance (Kimura-2-parametre model) of 3.6 and 0.7% for loci ITS2 and 28S-D2/D3, respectively. Pair-wise distance and phylogenetic analyses using ITS2 sequences of members of Minimus and Fluviatilis Complexes revealed that <i>An. fluviatilis</i> S is distantly related to <i>An. minimus</i> C as compared to any other members of the Fluviatilis Complex. These findings suggest that the two nominal species, <i>An. fluviatilis</i> S and <i>An. minimus</i> C, do not merit synonymy. The study also confirms that the reported species <i>An. fluviatilis</i> X is synonym with species S.</p>

				<title>Simple sequence repeats in mycobacterial genomes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0003-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites are the repetitive nucleotide sequences of motifs of length 1–6 bp. They are scattered throughout the genomes of all the known organisms ranging from viruses to eukaryotes. Microsatellites undergo mutations in the form of insertions and deletions (INDELS) of their repeat units with some bias towards insertions that lead to microsatellite tract expansion. Although prokaryotic genomes derive some plasticity due to microsatellite mutations they have in-built mechanisms to arrest undue expansions of microsatellites and one such mechanism is constituted by post-replicative DNA repair enzymes MutL, MutH and MutS. The mycobacterial genomes lack these enzymes and as a null hypothesis one could expect these genomes to harbour many long tracts. It is therefore interesting to analyse the mycobacterial genomes for distribution and abundance of microsatellites tracts and to look for potentially polymorphic microsatellites. Available mycobacterial genomes, <i>Mycobacterium avium, M. leprae, M. bovis</i> and the two strains of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (CDC1551 and H37Rv) were analysed for frequencies and abundance of SSRs. Our analysis revealed that the SSRs are distributed throughout the mycobacterial genomes at an average of 220–230 SSR tracts per kb. All the mycobacterial genomes contain few regions that are conspicuously denser or poorer in microsatellites compared to their expected genome averages. The genomes distinctly show scarcity of long microsatellites despite the absence of a post-replicative DNA repair system. Such severe scarcity of long microsatellites could arise as a result of strong selection pressures operating against long and unstable sequences although influence of GC-content and role of point mutations in arresting microsatellite expansions can not be ruled out. Nonetheless, the long tracts occasionally found in coding as well as non-coding regions may account for limited genome plasticity in these genomes.</p>

					<p>The sequence motifs present in the replication initiator protein (Rep) of geminiviruses have been compared with those present in all known rolling circle replication initiators. The predicted secondary structures of Rep representing each group of organisms have been compared and found to be conserved. Regions of recombination in the Rep gene and the adjoining 5&#8242; intergenic region (IR) of representative species of <i>Geminiviridae</i> have been identified using Recombination Detection Programs.

				<title>A hybrid approach for predicting promiscuous MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0031-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, a systematic attempt has been made to develop an accurate method for predicting MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes for a large number of MHC class I alleles. Initially, a quantitative matrix (QM)-based method was developed for 47 MHC class I alleles having at least 15 binders. A secondary artificial neural network (ANN)-based method was developed for 30 out of 47 MHC alleles having a minimum of 40 binders. Combination of these ANN- and QM-based prediction methods for 30 alleles improved the accuracy of prediction by 6% compared to each individual method. Average accuracy of hybrid method for 30 MHC alleles is 92.8%. This method also allows prediction of binders for 20 additional alleles using QM that has been reported in the literature, thus allowing prediction for 67 MHC class I alleles. The performance of the method was evaluated using jack-knife validation test. The performance of the methods was also evaluated on blind or independent data. Comparison of our method with existing MHC binder prediction methods for alleles studied by both methods shows that our method is superior to other existing methods. This method also identifies proteasomal cleavage sites in antigen sequences by implementing the matrices described earlier. Thus, the method that we discover allows the identification of MHC class I binders (peptides binding with many MHC alleles) having proteasomal cleavage site at C-terminus. The user-friendly result display format (HTML-II) can assist in locating the promiscuous MHC binding regions from antigen sequence. The method is available on the web at <i>www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nhlapred</i> and its mirror site is available at <i>http://bioinformatics.uams.edu/mirror/nhlapred/</i>.</p>

				<title>Genome inventory and analysis of nuclear hormone receptors in <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0043-0050</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) form a large superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, which regulate genes underlying a wide range of (patho) physiological phenomena. Availability of the full genome sequence of <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> facilitated a genome wide analysis of the NRs in fish genome. Seventy one NRs were found in <i>Tetraodon</i> and were compared with mammalian and fish NR family members. In general, there is a higher representation of NRs in fish genomes compared to mammalian ones. They showed high diversity across classes as observed by phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide substitution rates show strong negative selection among fish NRs except for pregnane X receptor (PXR), estrogen receptor (ER) and liver X receptor (LXR). This may be attributed to crucial role played by them in metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds and might have resulted in slight positive selection. Chromosomal mapping and pairwise comparisons of NR distribution in <i>Tetraodon</i> and humans led to the identification of nine syntenic NR regions, of which three are common among fully sequenced vertebrate genomes. Gene structure analysis shows strong conservation of exon structures among orthologoues. Whereas paralogous members show different splicing patterns with intron gain or loss and addition or substitution of exons played a major role in evolution of NR superfamily.</p>

				<title>``Pinning strategy": a novel approach for predicting the backbone structure in terms of protein blocks from sequence</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0051-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The description of protein 3D structures can be performed through a library of 3D fragments, named a structural alphabet. Our structural alphabet is composed of 16 small protein fragments of 5 C<sub>𝛼</sub> in length, called protein blocks (PBs). It allows an efficient approximation of the 3D protein structures and a correct prediction of the local structure. The 72 most frequent series of 5 consecutive PBs, called structural words (SWs) are able to cover more than 90% of the 3D structures. PBs are highly conditioned by the presence of a limited number of transitions between them. In this study, we propose a new method called “pinning strategy” that used this specific feature to predict long protein fragments. Its goal is to define highly probable successions of PBs. It starts from the most probable SW and is then extended with overlapping SWs. Starting from an initial prediction rate of 34.4%, the use of the SWs instead of the PBs allows a gain of 4.5%. The pinning strategy simply applied to the SWs increases the prediction accuracy to 39.9%. In a second step, the sequence-structure relationship is optimized, the prediction accuracy reaches 43.6%.</p>

				<title><i>ProRegIn</i>: A regularity index for the selection of native-like tertiary structures of proteins</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0071-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Automated protein tertiary structure prediction from sequence information alone remains an elusive goal to computational prescriptions. Dividing the problem into three stages viz. secondary structure prediction, generation of plausible main chain loop dihedrals and side chain dihedral optimization, considerable progress has been achieved in our laboratory (<i>http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/bhageerath/index.jsp</i>) and elsewhere for proteins with less than 100 amino acids. As a part of our on-going efforts in this direction and to facilitate tertiary structure selection/rejection in containing the combinatorial explosion of trial structures for a specified amino acid sequence, we describe here a web-enabled tool <i>ProRegIn</i> (Protein Regularity Index) developed based on the regularity in the 𝛷, Ψ dihedral angles of the amino acids that constitute loop regions. We have analysed the dihedrals in loop regions in a non-redundant dataset of 7351 proteins drawn from the Protein Data Bank and categorized them as helix-like or sheet-like (regular) or irregular. We noticed that the regularity thus defined exceeds 86% for 𝛷 barring glycine and 70% for Ψ for all the amino acid side chains including glycine, compelling us to reexamine the conventional view that loops are irregular regions structurally. The regularity index is presented here as a simple tool that finds its application in protein structure analysis as a discriminatory scoring function for rapid screening before the more compute intensive atomic level energy calculations could be undertaken. The tool is made freely accessible over the internet at <i>www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/proregin.jsp</i>.</p>

				<title>Comparison of sequence-based and structure-based phylogenetic trees of homologous proteins: Inferences on protein evolution</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0083-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several studies based on the known three-dimensional (3-D) structures of proteins show that two homologous proteins with insignificant sequence similarity could adopt a common fold and may perform same or similar biochemical functions. Hence, it is appropriate to use similarities in 3-D structure of proteins rather than the amino acid sequence similarities in modelling evolution of distantly related proteins. Here we present an assessment of using 3-D structures in modelling evolution of homologous proteins. Using a dataset of 108 protein domain families of known structures with at least 10 members per family we present a comparison of extent of structural and sequence dissimilarities among pairs of proteins which are inputs into the construction of phylogenetic trees. We find that correlation between the structure-based dissimilarity measures and the sequence-based dissimilarity measures is usually good if the sequence similarity among the homologues is about 30% or more. For protein families with low sequence similarity among the members, the correlation coefficient between the sequence-based and the structure-based dissimilarities are poor. In these cases the structure-based dendrogram clusters proteins with most similar biochemical functional properties better than the sequence-similarity based dendrogram. In multi-domain protein families and disulphide-rich protein families the correlation coefficient for the match of sequence-based and structure-based dissimilarity (SDM) measures can be poor though the sequence identity could be higher than 30%. Hence it is suggested that protein evolution is best modelled using 3-D structures if the sequence similarities (SSM) of the homologues are very low.</p>

				<title>SURF'S UP! – Protein classification by surface comparisons</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0097-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Large-scale genome sequencing and structural genomics projects generate numerous sequences and structures for ‘hypothetical’ proteins without functional characterizations. Detection of homology to experimentally characterized proteins can provide functional clues, but the accuracy of homology-based predictions is limited by the paucity of tools for quantitative comparison of diverging residues responsible for the functional divergence. SURF’S UP! is a web server for analysis of functional relationships in protein families, as inferred from protein surface maps comparison according to the algorithm. It assigns a numerical score to the similarity between patterns of physicochemical features (charge, hydrophobicity) on compared protein surfaces. It allows recognizing clusters of proteins that have similar surfaces, hence presumably similar functions. The server takes as an input a set of protein coordinates and returns files with ``spherical coordinates” of proteins in a PDB format and their graphical presentation, a matrix with values of mutual similarities between the surfaces, and the unrooted tree that represents the clustering of similar surfaces, calculated by the neighbor-joining method. SURF’S UP! facilitates the comparative analysis of physicochemical features of the surface, which are the key determinants of the protein function. By concentrating on coarse surface features, SURF’S UP! can work with models obtained from comparative modelling. Although it is designed to analyse the conservation among homologs, it can also be used to compare surfaces of non-homologous proteins with different three-dimensional folds, as long as a functionally meaningful structural superposition is supplied by the user. Another valuable characteristic of our method is the lack of initial assumptions about the functional features to be compared. SURF’S UP! is freely available for academic researchers at <i>http://asia.genesilico.pl/surfs_up/</i>.</p>

				<title>Peptide segments in protein-protein interfaces</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0101-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An important component of functional genomics involves the understanding of protein association. The interfaces resulting from protein-protein interactions –</p>
					<ol> 
						<li>specific, as represented by the homodimeric quaternary structures and the complexes formed by two independently occurring protein components, and</li>
						<li>non-specific, as observed in the crystal lattice of monomeric proteins – have been analysed on the basis of the length and the number of peptide segments.</li>
					 </ol>
					 <p>In 1000 Å<sup>2</sup> of the interface area, contributed by a polypeptide chain, there would be 3.4 segments in homodimers, 5.6 in complexes and 6.3 in crystal contacts. Concomitantly, the segments are the longest (with 8.7 interface residues) in homodimers. Core segments (likely to contribute more towards binding) are more in number in homodimers (1.7) than in crystal contacts (0.5), and this number can be used as one of the parameters to distinguish between the two types of interfaces. Dominant segments involved in specific interactions, along with their secondary structural features, are enumerated.</p>

				<title>Modelling and simulation of signal transductions in an apoptosis pathway by using timed Petri nets</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0113-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper first presents basic Petri net components representing molecular interactions and mechanisms of signalling pathways, and introduces a method to construct a Petri net model of a signalling pathway with these components. Then a simulation method of determining the delay time of transitions, by using timed Petri nets – i.e. the time taken in firing of each transition – is proposed based on some simple principles that the number of tokens flowed into a place is equivalent to the number of tokens flowed out. Finally, the availability of proposed method is confirmed by observing signalling transductions in biological pathways through simulation experiments of the apoptosis signalling pathways as an example.</p>

				<title>Dynamic causal models of neural system dynamics: current state and future extensions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0129-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Complex processes resulting from interaction of multiple elements can rarely be understood by analytical scientific approaches alone; additional, mathematical models of system dynamics are required. This insight, which disciplines like physics have embraced for a long time already, is gradually gaining importance in the study of cognitive processes by functional neuroimaging. In this field, causal mechanisms in neural systems are described in terms of effective connectivity. Recently, dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was introduced as a generic method to estimate effective connectivity from neuroimaging data in a Bayesian fashion. One of the key advantages of DCM over previous methods is that it distinguishes between neural state equations and modality-specific forward models that translate neural activity into a measured signal. Another strength is its natural relation to Bayesian model selection (BMS) procedures. In this article, we review the conceptual and mathematical basis of DCM and its implementation for functional magnetic resonance imaging data and event-related potentials. After introducing the application of BMS in the context of DCM, we conclude with an outlook to future extensions of DCM. These extensions are guided by the long-term goal of using dynamic system models for pharmacological and clinical applications, particularly with regard to synaptic plasticity.</p>

				<title>Formal TCA cycle description based on elementary actions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0145-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many databases propose their own structure and format to provide data describing biological processes. This heterogeneity contributes to the difficulty of large systematic and automatic functional comparisons. To overcome these problems, we have used the BioΨ formal description scheme which allows multi-level representations of biological process information. Applied to the description of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), we show that BioΨ allows the formal integration of functional information existing in current databases and make them available for further automated analysis. In addition such a formal TCA cycle process description leads to a more accurate biological process annotation which takes in account the biological context. This enables us to perform an automated comparison of the TCA cycles for seven different species based on processes rather than protein sequences. From current databases, BioΨ is able to unravel information that are already known by the biologists but are not available for automated analysis tools and simulation software, because of the lack of formal process descriptions. This use of the BioΨ description scheme to describe the TCA cycle was a key step of the MitoScop project that aims to describe and simulate mitochondrial metabolism <i>in silico</i>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Biological phenomena at the cellular level can be represented by various types of mathematical formulations. Such representations allow us to carry out numerical simulations that provide mechanistic insights into complex behaviours of biological systems and also generate hypotheses that can be experimentally tested. Currently, we are particularly interested in spatio-temporal representations of dynamic cellular phenomena and how such models can be used to understand biological specificity in functional responses. This review describes the capability and limitations of the approaches used to study spatio-temporal dynamics of cell signalling components.</p>

				<page>0169-0180</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bioinformatics has delivered great contributions to genome and genomics research, without which the world-wide success of this and other global (‘omics’) approaches would not have been possible. More recently, it has developed further towards the analysis of different kinds of networks thus laying the foundation for comprehensive description, analysis and manipulation of whole living systems in modern ``systems biology”. The next step which is necessary for developing a systems biology that deals with systemic phenomena is to expand the existing and develop new methodologies that are appropriate to characterize intercellular processes and interactions without omitting the causal underlying molecular mechanisms. Modelling the processes on the different levels of complexity involved requires a comprehensive integration of information on gene regulatory events, signal transduction pathways, protein interaction and metabolic networks as well as cellular functions in the respective tissues/organs.</p>

					<p>The unsymmetrical cyanine dyes BOXTO (4-[6-(benzoxazole-2-yl-(3-methyl-)-2,3-dihydro-(benzo-1,3-thiazole)-2-methylidene)]-1-methyl-quinolinium chloride) and its positive divalent derivative BOXTO-PRO (4-[(3-methyl-6-(benzoxazole-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-(benzo-1,3-thiazole)-2-methylidene)]-1-(3-trimethylammonium-propyl)-quinolinium dibromide) were studied as real-time PCR reporting fluorescent dyes and compared to SYBR GREEN I (SG) (2-[N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-propylamino]-4-[2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-(benzo-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-methylidene]-1-phenyl-quinolinium). Unmodified BOXTO showed no inhibitory effects on real-time PCR, while BOXTO-PRO showed complete inhibition. Sufficient fluorescent signal was acquired when 0.5–1.0 𝜇M BOXTO was used with RotorGene and iCycler platforms. Statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference between the efficiency and dynamic range of BOXTO and SG. BOXTO stock solution (1.5 mM) was stable at –20&#176;C for more than one year and 40 𝜇M BOXTO solution was more stable than 5x SG when both were stored at 4&#176;C for 45 days.</p>

				<title>cDNA cloning and expression analysis of a mannose-binding lectin from <i>Pinellia pedatisecta</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0241-0249</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Pinellia pedatisecta</i> agglutinin (PPA) is a very basic protein that accumulates in the tuber of <i>P. pedatisecta</i>. PPA is a hetero-tetramer protein of 40 kDa, composed of two polypeptide chains A (about 12 kDa) and two polypeptides chains B (about 12 kDa). The full-length cDNA of PPA was cloned from <i>P. pedatisecta</i> using SMART RACE-PCR technology; it was 1146 bp and contained a 771 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a lectin precursor of 256 amino acid residues with a 24 amino acid signal peptide. The PPA precursor contained 3 mannose-binding sites (QXDXNXVXY) and two conserved domains of 43% identity, PPA-DOM1 (polypeptides A) and PPA-DOM<sub>2</sub> (polypeptides B). PPA shared varying identities, ranging from 40% to 85%, with mannose-binding lectins from other species of plant families such as Araceae, Alliaceae, Iridaceae, Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae and Bromeliaceae. Southern blot analysis indicated that <i>ppa</i> belonged to a multi-copy gene family. Expression pattern analysis revealed that <i>ppa</i> expressed in most tested tissues, with high expression being found in spadix, spathe and tuber. Cloning of the <i>ppa</i> gene not only provides a basis for further investigation of its structure, expression and regulatory mechanism, but also enables us to test its potential role in controlling pests and fungal diseases by transferring the gene into plants in the future.</p>

				<title>Antisense expression of a gene encoding a calcium-binding protein in transgenic tobacco leads to altered morphology and enhanced chlorophyll</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0251-0260</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> contains a novel calcium-binding protein like calmodulin, which was discovered earlier, and we have reported the presence of its homologue(s) and a dependent protein kinase in plants. To understand the functions of these in plants, a cDNA encoding a calcium-binding protein isolated from <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> (EhCaBP) was cloned into vector pBI121 in antisense orientation and transgenic tobacco plants were raised. These plants showed variation in several phenotypic characters, of which two distinct features, more greenness and leaf thickness, were inherited in subsequent generations. The increase in the level of total chlorophyll in different plants ranged from 60% to 70%. There was no major change in chloroplast structure and in the protein level of D1, D2, LHCP and RuBP carboxylase. These morphological changes were not seen in antisense calmodulin transgenic tobacco plants, nor was the calmodulin level altered in EhCaBP antisense plants.</p>

				<title>A homologue of the defender against the apoptotic death gene (<i>dad1</i>) in UV-exposed <i>Chlamydomonas</i> cells is downregulated with the onset of programmed cell death</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0261-0270</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here the isolation of a homologue of the potential anti-apoptotic gene, defender against apoptotic death (<i>dad1</i>) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we investigated its expression in the execution process of programmed cell death (PCD) in UV-C exposed dying <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells. Reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR showed that <i>C. reinhardtii dad1</i> amplification was drastically reduced in UV-C exposed dying <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells. We connect the downregulation of <i>dad1</i> with the upregulation of apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1) and the physiological changes that occur in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells upon exposure to 12 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV-C in order to show a reciprocal relationship between proapoptotic and inhibitor of apoptosis factors. The temporal changes indicate a correlation between the onset of cell death and <i>dad1</i> downregulation. The sequence of the PCR product of the cDNA encoding the <i>dad1</i> homologue was aligned with the annotated <i>dad1</i> (C_20215) from the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> database (http://genome.jgi-psf.org:8080/annotator/servlet/jgi.annotation.Annotation?pDb=chlre2); <i>Annotation?pDb=chlre2</i>); this sequence was found to show 100% identity, both at the nucleotide and amino acid level. The 327 bp transcript showed an open reading frame of 87 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative <i>C. reinhardtii</i> DAD1 homologue showed 54% identity with <i>Oryza sativa</i>, 56% identity with <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, 66% identity with <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, and 64% identity with <i>Homo sapiens, Sus scrofa, Gallus gallus, Rattus norvegicus</i> and <i>Mus musculus</i>.</p>

				<title>Electrochemical investigation of the effect of some organic phosphates on haemoglobin</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0271-0278</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of DPG, IHP, GTP, GDP and GMP on the structure and stability of haemoglobin were electrochemically investigated with an iodide-modified silver electrode in 0.01 M KNO3 at pH 7.0. Anodic and cathodic peaks of haemoglobin were observed at 250 mV and 12 mV with a formal potential value of 133 mV <i>vs</i>. Ag/AgCl. The effects of different concentrations of DPG, IHP, GTP, GDP and GMP on the anaerobic redox reaction were determined. The results showed that DPG and IHP can lead to a positive shift in the reduction peak of haemoglobin, indicating that the oxidation peak shift of haemoglobin was small as a result of stabilization of the reduced state and destabilization of the R-like state of haemoglobin. GTP elicited a more positive shift in the cathodic and anodic peaks of haemoglobin at a higher concentration, signifying that it has a low-affinity binding site on haemoglobin. The positive shift of the cathodic and anodic peaks revealed a slight variation in the structure and indicated the unfolding of haemoglobin in the presence of high concentrations of GTP. Our study also showed that GDP and GMP did not cause significant shift the cathodic and anodic peaks of haemoglobin even at high concentrations, refuting the existence of specific GDP- and GMP-binding sites on the protein. Moreover, the iodide-modified silver electrode method proved to be easy and useful in investigating the effects of ligands or other effectors on haemoglobin in solution.</p>

				<title>Dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoate esters inhibit the neutrophil respiratory burst</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0279-0291</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The leukotoxins [9(10)- and 12(13)-EpOME] are produced by activated inflammatory leukocytes such as neutrophils. High EpOME levels are observed in disorders such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and in patients with extensive burns. Although the physiological significance of the EpOMEs remains poorly understood, in some systems, the EpOMEs act as a protoxin, with their corresponding epoxide hydrolase metabolites, 9,10- and 12,13-DiHOME, specifically exerting toxicity. Both the EpOMEs and the DiHOMEs were also recently shown to have neutrophil chemotactic activity. We evaluated whether the neutrophil respiratory burst, a surge of oxidant production thought to play an important role in limiting certain bacterial and fungal infections, is modulated by members of the EpOME metabolic pathway. We present evidence that the DiHOMEs suppress the neutrophil respiratory burst by a mechanism distinct from that of respiratory burst inhibitors such as cyclosporin H or lipoxin A4, which inhibit multiple aspects of neutrophil activation.</p>

				<title>Age-related decrease in rod bipolar cell density of the human retina: an immunohistochemical study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0293-0298</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During normal ageing, the rods (and other neurones) undergo a significant decrease in density in the human retina from the fourth decade of life onward. Since the rods synapse with the rod bipolar cells in the outer plexiform layer, a decline in rod density (mainly due to death) may ultimately cause an associated decline of the neurones which, like the rod bipolar cells, are connected to them. The rod bipolar cells are selectively stained with antibodies to protein kinase C-𝛼. This study examined if rod bipolar cell density changes with ageing of the retina, utilizing donor human eyes (age: 6–91 years). The retinas were fixed and their temporal parts from the macula to the mid-periphery sectioned and processed for protein kinase C-𝛼 immunohistochemistry. The density of the immunopositive rod bipolar cells was estimated in the mid-peripheral retina (eccentricity: 3–5 mm) along the horizontal temporal axis. The results show that while there is little change in the density of the rod bipolar cells from 6 to 35 years (2.2%), the decline during the period from 35 to 62 years is about 21% and between seventh and tenth decades, it is approximately 27%.</p>

				<title>Programmed cell death in the larval salivary glands of <i>Apis mellifera</i> (Hymenoptera, Apidae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0309-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The morphological and histochemical features of degeneration in honeybee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) salivary glands were investigated in 5th instar larvae and in the pre-pupal period. The distribution and activity patterns of acid phosphatase enzyme were also analysed. As a routine, the larval salivary glands were fixed and processed for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Tissue sections were subsequently stained with haematoxylin–eosin, bromophenol blue, silver, or a variant of the critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) method. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Glands were processed for the histochemical and cytochemical localization of acid phosphatase, as well as biochemical assay to detect its activity pattern. Acid phosphatase activity was histochemically detected in all the salivary glands analysed. The cytochemical results showed acid phosphatase in vesicles, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes during the secretory phase and, additionally, in autophagic structures and luminal secretion during the degenerative phase. These findings were in agreement with the biochemical assay. At the end of the 5th instar, the glandular cells had a vacuolated cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei, and epithelial cells were shed into the glandular lumen. The transition phase from the 5th instar to the pre-pupal period was characterized by intense vacuolation of the basal cytoplasm and release of parts of the cytoplasm into the lumen by apical blebbing; these blebs contained cytoplasmic RNA, rough endoplasmic reticule and, occasionally, nuclear material. In the pre-pupal phase, the glandular epithelium showed progressive degeneration so that at the end of this phase only nuclei and remnants of the cytoplasm were observed. The nuclei were pyknotic, with peripheral chromatin and blebs. The gland remained in the haemolymph and was recycled during metamorphosis. The programmed cell death in this gland represented a morphological form intermediate between apoptosis and autophagy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The three basic cell types in the migrating slug of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> show differential chemotactic response to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and differential sensitivity to suppression of the chemotaxis by ammonia. The values of these parameters indicate a progressive maturation of chemotactic properties during the transdifferentiation of slug cell types. We present a model that explains the localization of the three cell types within the slug based on these chemotactic differences and on the maturation of their chemotactic properties.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0339-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electroantennograms (EAGs) were recorded from males and females of the potato tuber moth, <i>Phthorimaea operculella</i> in response to a broad range of plant volatile compounds belonging to diverse chemical classes. The responses to 27 compounds were evaluated, which indicated significant differences in EAGs between chemicals as well as between sexes. The fatty acid derivatives comprising essentially green leaf volatile components elicited significantly greater responses in females. The response profile of males was, in general, lower than that of females. EAG responses to the oxygenated and hydrocarbon monoterpenes were lower in both males and females. Dose–response studies indicate differences in response between the sexes and concentrations, suggesting the existence of sexual dimorphism. Compounds belonging to the fatty acid derivatives class appear to be important for an oligophagous pest such as the potato tuber moth and the findings are discussed in relation to host plant selection in this species.</p>

				<title>A mechanical model of wing and theoretical estimate of taper factor for three gliding birds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0351-0361</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We tested a mechanical model of wing, which was constructed using the measurements of wingspan and wing area taken from three species of gliding birds. In this model, we estimated the taper factors of the wings for jackdaw (<i>Corrus monedula</i>), Harris’ hawk (<i>Parabuteo unicinctas</i>) and Lagger falcon (<i>Falco jugger</i>) as 1.8, 1.5 and 1.8, respectively. Likewise, by using the data linear regression and curve estimation method, as well as estimating the taper factors and the angle between the humerus and the body, we calculated the relationship between wingspan, wing area and the speed necessary to meet the aerodynamic requirements of sustained flight. In addition, we calculated the relationship between the speed, wing area and wingspan for a specific angle between the humerus and the body over the range of stall speed to maximum speed of gliding flight. We then compared the results for these three species of gliding birds. These comparisons suggest that the aerodynamic characteristics of Harris’ hawk wings are similar to those of the falcon but different from those of the jackdaw. This paper also presents two simple equations to estimate the minimum angle between the humerus and the body as well as the minimum span ratio of a bird in gliding flight.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0363-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This is the first comprehensive study on planktonic heterotrophic bacterial cell size in the river Cauvery and its important tributaries in Karnataka State, India. The initial hypothesis that the mean cell size of planktonic heterotrophic bacteria in the four tributaries are markedly different from each other and also from that in the main river Cauvery was rejected, because all five watercourses showed similar planktonic heterotrophic bacterial cell size. Examination of the correlation between mean heterotrophic bacterial cell size and environmental variables showed four correlations in the river Arkavathy and two in the river Shimsha. Regression analysis revealed that 18% of the variation in mean heterotrophic free-living bacterial cell size was due to biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the river Arkavathy, 11% due to surface water velocity (SWV) in the river Cauvery and 11% due to temperature in the river Kapila. Heterotrophic particle-bound bacterial cell size variation was 28% due to chloride and BOD in the river Arkavathy, 11% due to conductivity in the river Kapila and 8% due to calcium in the river Cauvery. This type of relationship between heterotrophic bacterial cell size and environmental variables suggests that, though the mean heterotrophic bacterial cell size was similar in all the five water courses, different sets of environmental variables apparently control the heterotrophic bacterial cell size in the various water bodies studied in this investigation. The possible cause for this environmental (bottom–up) control is discussed.</p>

				<page>0375-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Changes in the composition of plant species induced by grassland degradation may alter soil respiration rates and decrease carbon sequestration; however, few studies in this area have been conducted. We used net primary productivity (NPP), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and soil organic carbon (SOC) to examine the changes in soil respiration and carbon balance in two Chinese temperate grassland communities dominated by <i>Leymus chinensis</i> (undisturbed community; Community 1) and <i>Puccinellia tenuiflora</i> (degraded community; Community 2), respectively. Soil respiration varied from 2.5 to 11.9 g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> and from 1.5 to 9.3 g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, and the contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration from 38% to 76% and from 25% to 72% in Communities 1 and 2, respectively. During the growing season (May–September), soil respiration, shoot biomass, live root biomass, MBC and SOC in Community 2 decreased by 28%, 39%, 45%, 55% and 29%, respectively, compared to those in Community 1. The considerably lower net ecosystem productivity in Community 2 than in Community 1 (104.56 <i>vs</i>. 224.73 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) suggests that the degradation has significantly decreased carbon sequestration of the ecosystems.</p>

				<title>Detection without deflection? A hypothesis for direct sensing of sound pressure by hair cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0385-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is widely thought that organisms detect sound by sensing the deflection of hair-like projections, the stereocilia, at the apex of hair cells. In the case of mammals, the standard interpretation is that hair cells in the cochlea respond to deflection of stereocilia induced by motion generated by a hydrodynamic travelling wave. But in the light of persistent anomalies, an alternative hypothesis seems to have some merit: that sensing cells (in particular the outer hair cells) may, at least at low intensities, be reacting to a different stimulus – the rapid pressure wave that sweeps through the cochlear fluids at the speed of sound in water. This would explain why fast responses are sometimes seen before the peak of the travelling wave. Yet how could cells directly sense fluid pressure? Here, a model is constructed of the outer hair cell as a pressure vessel able to sense pressure variations across its cuticular pore, and this ‘fontanelle’ model, based on the sensing action of the basal body at this compliant spot, could explain the observed anomalies. Moreover, the fontanelle model can be applied to a wide range of other organisms, suggesting that direct pressure detection is a general mode of sensing complementary to stereociliar displacement.</p>

				<title>Molecular mechanism of insulin resistance</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0405-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Free fatty acids are known to play a key role in promoting loss of insulin sensitivity, thereby causing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanism involved is still unclear. In searching for the cause of the mechanism, it has been found that palmitate inhibits insulin receptor (IR) gene expression, leading to a reduced amount of IR protein in insulin target cells. PDK1-independent phosphorylation of PKCε causes this reduction in insulin receptor gene expression. One of the pathways through which fatty acid can induce insulin resistance in insulin target cells is suggested by these studies. We provide an overview of this important area, emphasizing the current status.</p>

				<title>The stability of ecosystems: A brief overview of the paradox of enrichment</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0421-0428</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In theory, enrichment of resource in a predator–prey model leads to desta bilization of the system, thereby collapsing the trophic interaction, a phe nomenon referred to as ``the paradox of enrichment”. After it was first pro posed by Rosenzweig (1971), a number of subsequent studies were carried out on this dilemma over many decades. In this article, we review these the oretical and experimental works and give a brief overview of the proposed solutions to the paradox. The mechanisms that have been discussed are modifications of simple predator–prey models in the presence of prey that is inedible, invulnerable, unpalatable and toxic. Another class of mechanisms includes an incorporation of a ratio-dependent functional form, inducible defence of prey and density-dependent mortality of the predator. Moreover, we find a third set of explanations based on complex population dynamics including chaos in space and time. We conclude that, although any one of the various mechanisms proposed so far might potentially prevent destabilization of the predator–prey dynamics following enrichment, in nature different mechanisms may combine to cause stability, even when a system is enriched. The exact mechanisms, which may differ among systems, need to be disentangled through extensive field studies and labo ratory experiments coupled with realistic theoretical models.</p>

				<title>Key issues in achieving an integrative perspective on stress</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0433-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An integrative perspective on molecular mechanisms of stress resistance requires understanding of these mechanisms not just in vitro or in the model organism in the research laboratory – but in the healthy or diseased human in society, in the cultivated plant or animal in agricultural production, and in populations and species in natural communities and ecosystems. Such understanding involves careful attention to the context in which the organism normally undergoes stress, and appreciation that biological phenomena occur at diverse levels of organization (from molecule to ecosystem). Surprisingly, three issues fundamental to achieving an integrative perspective are presently unresolved:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Is variation in lower-level traits (nucleotide sequences, genes, gene products) seldom, commonly, or always consequential for stress resistance?</li>
						<li>Does environmental stress reduce or enhance genetic variation, which is the raw material of evolution?</li>
						<li>Is the present distribution of organisms along natural gradients of stress largely the result of organisms living where they can, or is adaptive evolution generally sufficient to overcome stress?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Effective collaboration among disciplinary specialists and meta-analysis may be helpful in resolving these issues.</p>

				<title>Molecular chaperones: The modular evolution of cellular networks</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0441-0446</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular chaperones play a prominent role in signaling and transcriptional regulatory networks of the cell. Recent advances uncovered that chaperones act as genetic buffers stabilizing the phenotype of various cells and organisms and may serve as potential regulators of evolvability. Chaperones have weak links, connect hubs, are in the overlaps of network modules and may uncouple these modules during stress, which gives an additional protection for the cell at the network-level. Moreover, after stress chaperones are essential to re-build inter-modular contacts by their low affinity sampling of the potential interaction partners in different modules. This opens the way to the chaperone-regulated modular evolution of cellular networks, and helps us to design novel therapeutic and anti-aging strategies.</p>

				<title>Studying stress responses in the post-genomic era: its ecological and evolutionary role</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0447-0456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most investigations on the effects of and responses to stress exposures have been performed on a limited number of model organisms in the laboratory. Here much progress has been made in terms of identifying and describing beneficial and detrimental effects of stress, responses to stress and the mechanisms behind stress tolerance. However, to gain further understanding of which genes are involved in stress resistance and how the responses are regulated from an ecological and evolutionary perspective there is a need to combine studies on multiple levels of biological organization from DNA to phenotypes. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of studying ecologically relevant traits and natural or semi-natural conditions to verify whether the results obtained are representative of the ecological and evolutionary processes in the field. Here, we will review what we currently know about thermal adaptation and the role of different stress responses to thermal challenges in insects, particularly <i>Drosophila</i>. Furthermore, we address some key questions that require future attention.</p>

				<title>Molecular mechanisms of canalization: Hsp90 and beyond</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0457-0463</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Hsp90 chaperone machine facilitates the maturation of a diverse set of ‘client’ proteins. Many of these Hsp90 clients are essential nodes in signal transduction pathways and regulatory circuits, accounting for the important role Hsp90 plays in organismal development and responses to the environment. Recent findings suggest a broader impact of the chaperone on phenotype: fully functional Hsp90 canalizes wild-type phenotypes by suppressing underlying genetic and epigenetic variation. This variation can be expressed upon challenging the Hsp90 machinery by environmental stress, genetic or pharmaceutical targeting of Hsp90. The existence of Hsp90-buffered genetic and epigenetic variation together with plausible release mechanisms has wide-ranging implication for phenotype and possibly evolutionary processes. Here, we discuss the role of Hsp90 in canalization and organismal plasticity, and highlight important questions for future experimental inquiry.</p>

				<title>Developmental plasticity and acclimation both contribute to adaptive responses to alternating seasons of plenty and of stress in <i>Bicyclus butterflies</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0465-0475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plasticity is a crucial component of the life cycle of invertebrates that live as active adults throughout wet and dry seasons in the tropics. Such plasticity is seen in the numerous species of <i>Bicyclus</i> butterflies in Africa which exhibit seasonal polyphenism with sequential generations of adults with one or other of two alternative phenotypes. These differ not only in wing pattern but in many other traits. This divergence across a broad complex of traits is associated with survival and reproduction either in a wet season that is favourable in terms of resources, or mainly in a dry season that is more stressful. This phenomenon has led us to examine the bases of the developmental plasticity in a model species, <i>B. anynana</i>, and also the evolution of key adult life history traits, including starvation resistance and longevity. We now understand something about the processes that generate variation in the phenotype, and also about the ecological context of responses to environmental stress. The responses clearly involve a mix of developmental plasticity as cued by different environments in pre-adult development, and the acclimation of life history traits in adults to their prevailing environment.</p>

				<title>The role of stress proteins in responses of a montane willow leaf beetle to environmental temperature variation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0477-0488</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The heat shock response is a critical mechanism by which organisms buffer effects of variable and unpredictable environmental temperatures. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) increases survival after exposure to stressful conditions in nature, although benefits of Hsp expression are often balanced by costs to growth and reproductive success. Hsp-assisted folding of variant polypeptides may prevent development of unfit phenotypes; thus, some differences in Hsp expression among natural populations of ectotherms may be due to interactions between enzyme variants (allozymes) and Hsps. In the Sierra willow leaf beetle <i>Chrysomela aeneicollis</i>, which lives in highly variable thermal habitats at the southern edge of their range in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, California, allele frequencies at the enzyme locus <i>phosphoglucose isomerase</i> (PGI) vary across a climatic latitudinal gradient. PGI allozymes differ in kinetic properties, and expression of a 70 kDa Hsp differs between populations, along elevation gradients, and among PGI genotypes. Differences in Hsp70 expression among PGI genotypes correspond to differences in thermal tolerance and traits important for reproductive success, such as running speed, survival and fecundity. Thus, differential Hsp expression among genotypes may allow functionally important genetic variation to persist, allowing populations to respond effectively to environmental change.</p>

				<title>Molecular mechanisms underlying thermal adaptation of xeric animals</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0489-0499</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For many years, we and our collaborators have investigated the adaptive role of heat shock proteins in different animals, including the representatives of homothermic and poikilothermic species that inhabit regions with contrasting thermal conditions. Adaptive evolution of the response to hyperthermia has led to different results depending upon the species. The thermal threshold of induction of heat shock proteins in desert thermophylic species is, as a rule, higher than in the species from less extreme climates. In addition, thermoresistant poikilothermic species often exhibit a certain level of heat shock proteins in cells even at a physiologically normal temperature. Furthermore, there is often a positive correlation between the characteristic temperature of the ecological niche of a given species and the amount of Hsp70-like proteins in the cells at normal temperature. Although in most cases adaptation to hyperthermia occurs without changes in the number of heat shock genes, these genes can be amplified in some xeric species. It was shown that mobile genetic elements may play an important role in the evolution and fine-tuning of the heat shock response system, and can be used for direct introduction of mutations in the promoter regions of these genes.</p>

				<title>specific and unspecific responses of plants to cold and drought stress</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0501-0510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Different environmental stresses to a plant may result in similar responses at the cellular and molecular level. This is due to the fact that the impacts of the stressors trigger similar strains and downstream signal transduction chains. A good example for an unspecific response is the reaction to stressors which induce water deficiency e.g. drought, salinity and cold, especially frost. The stabilizing effect of liquid water on the membrane bilayer can be supported by compatible solutes and special proteins. At the metabolic level, osmotic adjustment by synthesis of low-molecular osmolytes (carbohydrates, betains, proline) can counteract cellular dehydration and turgor loss. Taking the example of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, changes at the level of membrane composition, and concomitantly of photosynthetic capacity during frost hardening is shown. Additionally the effect of photoperiod as measured via the phytochrome system and the effect of subfreezing temperatures on the incidence of frost hardening is discussed. Extremely hydrophilic proteins such as dehydrins are common products protecting not only the biomembranes in ripening seeds (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) but accumulate also in the shoots and roots during cold adaptation, especially in drought tolerant plants. Dehydrins are characterized by conserved amino acid motifs, called the K-, Y- or S-segments. Accumulation of dehydrins can be induced not only by drought, but also by cold, salinity, treatment with abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate. Positive effects of the overexpression of a wild chickpea (<i>Cicer pinnatifidum</i>) dehydrin in tobacco plants on the dehydration tolerance is shown. The presentation discusses the perception of cold and drought, the subsequent signal transduction and expression of genes and their products. Differences and similarities between the plant responses to both stressors are also discussed.</p>

				<title>Protein stress and stress proteins: implications in aging and disease</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0511-0515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Environmantal stress induces damage that activates an adaptive response in any organism. The cellular stress response is based on the induction of cytoprotective proteins, the so called stress or heat shock proteins. The stress response as well as stress proteins are ubiquitous, highly conserved mechanism, and genes, respectively, already present in prokaryotes. Chaperones protect the proteome against conformational damage, promoting the function of protein networks. Protein damage takes place during aging and in several degenerative diseases, and presents a threat to overload the cellular defense mechanisms. The preservation of a robust stress response and protein disposal is indispensable for health and longevity. This review summarizes the present knowledge of protein damage, turnover, and the stress response in aging and degenerative diseases.</p>

				<title>Heat shock protein 90: the cancer chaperone</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0517-0530</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability and function of a number of conditionally activated and/or expressed signalling proteins, as well as multiple mutated, chimeric, and/or over-expressed signalling proteins, that promote cancer cell growth and/or survival. Hsp90 inhibitors are unique in that, although they are directed towards a specific molecular target, they simultaneously inhibit multiple cellular signalling pathways. By inhibiting nodal points in multiple overlapping survival pathways utilized by cancer cells, combination of an Hsp90 inhibitor with standard chemotherapeutic agents may dramatically increase the in vivo efficacy of the standard agent. Hsp90 inhibitors may circumvent the characteristic genetic plasticity that has allowed cancer cells to eventually evade the toxic effects of most molecularly targeted agents. The mechanism-based use of Hsp90 inhibitors, both alone and in combination with other drugs, should be effective toward multiple forms of cancer. Further, because Hsp90 inhibitors also induce Hsf-1-dependent expression of Hsp70, and because certain mutated Hsp90 client proteins are neurotoxic, these drugs display ameliorative properties in several neurodegenerative disease models, suggesting a novel role for Hsp90 inhibitors in treating multiple pathologies involving neurodegeneration.</p>

				<title>Three-dimensional structure of heat shock protein 90 from <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>: molecular modelling approach to rational drug design against malaria</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0531-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have recently implicated heat shock protein 90 from <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (PfHsp90) as a potential drug target against malaria. Using inhibitors specific to the nucleotide binding domain of Hsp90, we have shown potent growth inhibitory effects on development of malarial parasite in human erythrocytes. To gain better understanding of the vital role played by PfHsp90 in parasite growth, we have modeled its three dimensional structure using recently described full length structure of yeast Hsp90. Sequence similarity found between PfHsp90 and yeast Hsp90 allowed us to model the core structure with high confidence. The superimposition of the predicted structure with that of the template yeast Hsp90 structure reveals an RMSD of 3.31 Å. The N-terminal and middle domains showed the least RMSD (1.76 Å) while the more divergent C–terminus showed a greater RMSD (2.84 Å) with respect to the template. The structure shows overall conservation of domains involved in nucleotide binding, ATPase activity, co-chaperone binding as well as inter-subunit interactions. Important co-chaperones known to modulate Hsp90 function in other eukaryotes are conserved in malarial parasite as well. An acidic stretch of amino acids found in the linker region, which is uniquely extended in PfHsp90 could not be modeled in this structure suggesting a flexible conformation. Our results provide a basis to compare the overall structure and functional pathways dependent on PfHsp90 in malarial parasite. Further analysis of differences found between human and parasite Hsp90 may make it possible to design inhibitors targeted specifically against malaria.</p>

				<title>Polyglutamine expansion in <i>Drosophila</i>: thermal stress and Hsp70 as selective agents</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0537-0547</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Repetitive DNA sequences that encode polyglutamine tracts are prone to expansion and cause highly deleterious phenotypes of neurodegeneration. Despite this tendency, polyglutamine tracts (``polyQs”) are conserved features of eukaryotic genomes. PolyQs are the most frequent protein-coding homotypic repeat in insect genomes, and are found predominantly in genes encoding transcription factors conserved from <i>Drosophila</i> through human. Although highly conserved across species, polyQ lengths vary widely within species. In <i>D. melanogaster</i>, polyQs in 25 genes have more alleles and higher heterozygosity than all other poly-amino acid tracts. The heat shock protein Hsp70 is a principal suppressor of polyQ expansions and may play a key role in modulating the phenotypes of the alleles that encode them. Hsp70 also promotes tolerance of natural thermal stress in <i>Drosophila</i> and diverse organisms, a role which may deplete the chaperone from buffering against polyQ toxicity. Thus in stressful environments, natural selection against long polyQ alleles more prone to expansion and deleterious phenotypes may be more effective. This hypothesis can be tested by measuring the phenotypic interactions between <i>Hsp70</i> and polyQ transgenes in <i>D. melanogaster</i> undergoing natural thermal stress, an approach which integrates comparative genomics with experimental and ecological genetics.</p>

				<title>Thermosensors in eubacteria: role and evolution</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0549-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature is an important physical stress factor sensed by bacteria and used to regulate gene expression. Three different macromolecules have been identified being able to sense temperature: DNA, mRNA and proteins. Depending on the induction mechanism, two different pathways have to be distinguished, namely the heat shock response and the high temperature response. While the heat shock response is induced by temperature increments and is transient, the high temperature response needs a specific temperature to become induced and proceeds as long as cells are exposed to that temperature. The heat shock response is induced by denatured proteins and aimed to prevent formation of protein aggregates by refolding or degradation, and the high temperature response is mainly used by pathogenic bacteria to detect entry into a mammalian host followed by induction of their virulence genes. All known high temperature sensors are present in two alternative conformations depending on the temperature. Heat shock sensors are either molecular chaperones or proteases which keep either a positive transcriptional regulator inactive or a negative regulator active or do not attack the regulator, respectively, under physiological conditions. Denatured proteins either titrate the molecular chaperones or activate the protease. The evolution of the different temperature sensors is discussed.</p>

				<title>The Kdp-ATPase system and its regulation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0559-0568</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>K<sup>+</sup>, the dominant intracellular cation, is required for various physiological processes like turgor homeostasis, pH regulation etc. Bacterial cells have evolved many diverse K<sup>+</sup> transporters to maintain the desired concentration of internal K<sup>+</sup>. In <i>E. coli</i>, the KdpATPase (comprising of the KdpFABC complex), encoded by the <i>kdpFABC</i> operon, is an inducible high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter that is synthesised under conditions of severe K<sup>+</sup> limitation or osmotic upshift. The <i>E. coli kdp</i> expression is transcriptionally regulated by the KdpD and KdpE proteins, which together constitute a typical bacterial two-component signal transduction system. The Kdp system is widely dispersed among the different classes of bacteria including the cyanobacteria. The ordering of the <i>kdpA, kdpB</i> and <i>kdpC</i> is relatively fixed but the <i>kdpD/E</i> genes show different arrangements in distantly related bacteria. Our studies have shown that the cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. strain L-31 possesses two <i>kdp</i> operons, <i>kdp1</i> and <i>kdp2</i>, of which, the later is expressed under K<sup>+</sup> deficiency and desiccation. Among the regulatory genes, the <i>kdpD</i> ORF of <i>Anabaena</i> L-31 is truncated when compared to the <i>kdpD</i> of other bacteria, while a <i>kdpE</i>-like gene is absent. The extremely radio-resistant bacterium, <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> strain <i>R1</i>, also shows the presence of a naturally short <i>kdpD</i> ORF similar to <i>Anabaena</i> in its <i>kdp</i> operon. The review elaborates the expression of bacterial <i>kdp</i> operons in response to various environmental stress conditions, with special emphasis on <i>Anabaena</i>. The possible mechanism(s) of regulation of the unique <i>kdp</i> operons from <i>Anabaena</i> and <i>Deinococcus</i> are also discussed.</p>

				<title>Basal transcription machinery: role in regulation of stress response in eukaryotes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0569-0578</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The holoenzyme of prokaryotic RNA polymerase consists of the core enzyme, made of two 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛽’ and 𝜔 subunits, which lacks promoter selectivity and a sigma (𝜎) subunit which enables the core enzyme to initiate transcription in a promoter dependent fashion. A stress sigma factor 𝜎<sup><i>s</i></sup>, in prokaryotes seems to regulate several stress response genes in conjunction with other stress specific regulators. Since the basic principles of transcription are conserved from simple bacteria to multicellular complex organisms, an obvious question is: what is the identity of a counterpart of 𝜎<sup><i>s</i></sup>, that is closest to the core polymerase and that dictates transcription of stress regulated genes in general? In this review, we discuss the logic behind the suggestion that like in prokaryotes, eukaryotes also have a common functional unit in the transcription machinery through which the stress specific transcription factors regulate rapid and highly controlled induction of gene expression associated with generalized stress response and point to some candidates that would fit the bill of the eukaryotic 𝜎<sup><i>s</i></sup>.</p>

					<p>Currently two mechanisms are recognized by which heat shock proteins (HSP) are released from cells; a passive release mechanism, including necrotic cell death, severe blunt trauma, surgery and following infection with lytic viruses, and an active release mechanism which involves the non classical protein release pathway. HSPs are released both as free HSP and within exosomes. This review covers recent findings on the mechanism by which stress induces the release of HSP72 into the circulation and the biological significance of circulating HSP72 to host defense against disease.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Heat shock response is associated with the synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) which is strictly regulated by different members of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). We previously reported that a rat histiocytoma, BC-8 failed to synthesize Hsps when subjected to typical heat shock conditions (42&#176;C, 60 min). The lack of Hsp synthesis in these cells was due to a failure in HSF1 DNA binding activity. In the present study we report that BC-8 tumor cells when subjected to heat shock at higher temperature (43&#176;C, 60 min) or incubation for longer time at 42&#176;C, exhibited necrosis characteristics; however, under mild heat shock (42&#176;C, 30 min) conditions cells showed activation of autophagy. Mild heat shock treatment induced proteolysis of HSF1, and under similar conditions we observed an increase in HSF2 expression followed by its enhanced DNA binding activity. Inhibiting HSF1 proteolysis by reversible proteasome inhibition failed to inhibit heat shock induced autophagy. Compromising HSF2 expression but not HSF1 resulted in the inhibition of autophagy, suggesting HSF2 dependent activation of autophagy. We are reporting for the first time that HSF2 is heat inducible and functions in heat shock induced autophagic cell death in BC-8 tumor cells.</p>

				<title>Heat shock genes – integrating cell survival and death</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0595-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heat shock induced gene expression and other cellular responses help limit the damage caused by stress and thus facilitate cellular recovery. Cellular damage also triggers apoptotic cell death through several pathways. This paper briefly reviews interactions of the major heat shock proteins with components of the apoptotic pathways. Hsp90, which acts as a chaperone for unstable signal transducers to keep them poised for activation, interacts with RIP and Akt and promotes NF-𝜅B mediated inhibition of apoptosis; in addition it also blocks some steps in the apoptotic pathways. Hsp70 is mostly anti-apoptotic and acts at several levels like inhibition of translocation of Bax into mitochondria, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, formation of apoptosome and inhibition of activation of initiator caspases. Hsp70 also modulates JNK, NF-𝜅B and Akt signaling pathways in the apoptotic cascade. In contrast, Hsp60 has both anti- and pro-apoptotic roles. Cytosolic Hsp60 prevents translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax into mitochondria and thus promotes cell survival but it also promotes maturation of procaspase-3, essential for caspase mediated cell death. Our recent <i>in vivo</i> studies show that RNAi for the Hsp60D in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> prevents induced apoptosis. Hsp27 exerts its anti-apoptotic influence by inhibiting cytochrome c and TNF-mediated cell death. 𝛼𝛽 crystallin suppresses caspase-8 and cytochrome c mediated activation of caspase-3. Studies in our laboratory also reveal that absence or reduced levels of the developmentally active as well as stress induced non-coding hsr𝜔 transcripts, which are known to sequester diverse hnRNPs and related nuclear RNA-binding proteins, block induced apoptosis in <i>Drosophila</i>. Modulation of the apoptotic pathways by Hsps reflects their roles as ``weak links” between various ``hubs” in cellular networks. On the other hand, non-coding RNAs, by virtue of their potential to bind with multiple proteins, can act as ``hubs” in these networks. In view of the integrative nature of living systems, it is not surprising that stress-induced genes, generally believed to primarily function in cell survival pathways, inhibit or even promote cell death pathways at multiple levels to ensure homeostasis at cell and/or organism level. The heat shock genes obviously do much more than merely help cells survive stress.</p>

				<title>Complexity of rice Hsp100 gene family: lessons from rice genome sequence data</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0611-0619</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Elucidation of genome sequence provides an excellent platform to understand detailed complexity of the various gene families. Hsp100 is an important family of chaperones in diverse living systems. There are eight putative gene loci encoding for Hsp100 proteins in <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome. In rice, two full-length Hsp100 cDNAs have been isolated and sequenced so far. Analysis of rice genomic sequence by <i>in silico</i> approach showed that two isolated rice Hsp100 cDNAs correspond to <i>Os05g44340</i> and <i>Os02g32520</i> genes in the rice genome database. There appears to be three additional proteins (encoded by <i>Os03g31300, Os04g32560</i> and <i>Os04g33210</i> gene loci) that are variably homologous to Os05g44340 and Os02g32520 throughout the entire amino acid sequence. The above five rice <i>Hsp100</i> genes show significant similarities in the signature sequences known to be conserved among Hsp100 proteins. While <i>Os05g44340</i> encodes cytoplasmic Hsp100 protein, those encoded by the other four genes are predicted to have chloroplast transit peptides.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0621-0628</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Salt stress is an environmental factor that severely impairs plant growth and productivity. We have cloned a novel isoform of a vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter from <i>Pennisetum glaucum</i> (<i>PgNHX1</i>) that contains 5 transmembrane domains in contrast to <i>AtNHX1</i> and <i>OsNHX1</i> which have 9 transmembrane domains. Recently we have shown that <i>PgNHX1</i> could confer high level of salinity tolerance when overexpressed in <i>Brassica juncea</i>. Here, we report the functional validation of this antiporter in crop plant rice. Overexpression of <i>PgNHX1</i> conferred high level of salinity tolerance in rice. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing <i>PgNHX1</i> developed more extensive root system and completed their life cycle by setting flowers and seeds in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. Our data demonstrate the potential of <i>PgNHX1</i> for imparting enhanced salt tolerance capabilities to salt-sensitive crop plants for growing in high saline areas.</p>

				<title>Sources for Imanishi Kinji’s views of sociality and evolutionary outcomes</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0635-0641</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Prior to the contribution of genetics or the modern evolutionary synthesis (MES) to natural selection theory, social ecologists searched for factors in addition to natural selection that could influence species change. The idea that sociality, not just biology, was important in determining evolutionary outcomes was prevalent in research in social ecology in the 1920s and 1930s. The influence of ‘tradition’ (or the transmission of learned behaviours between generations) and the view that animals are active in selecting their own environments, rather than passive organisms acted upon by chance, were given as much attention as natural selection theory in European ecology, while animal aggregation and cooperation studies were pursued in America. Imanishi Kinji’s personal library and his scientific notes and papers reveal that he was well aware of this literature and had been profoundly influenced by these earlier viewpoints prior to writing his view of nature in his first book, <i>Seibutsu no Sekai</i> (The World of Living Things, 1941). Evidence is presented to show that he developed his theories based partly on early western debates in social ecology while finding inspiration and a way to express his views in the writings of philosopher Nishida Kitarō and, perhaps, General J C Smuts. One of Imanishi’s lasting contributions is in the demonstrated results of over 40 years of subsequent ecological and ethological research by Imanishi and those trained by him that maintained the broader viewpoints on evolution that had been dropped from the western corpus of research by the 1950s. The current attempt to again get beyond natural selection theory is reflected in debates surrounding genetic and cultural evolution of cooperation, the biology of ‘traditions’ and the idea of ‘culture’ in animal societies.</p>

				<title>Complete nucleotide sequence analysis of <i>Cymbidium mosaic virus</i> Indian isolate: further evidence for natural recombination among potexviruses</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0663-0669</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The complete nucleotide sequence of an Indian strain of <i>Cymbidium mosaic virus</i> (CymMV) was determined and compared with other potexviruses. Phylogenetic analyses on the basis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), triple gene block protein and coat protein (CP) amino acid sequences revealed that CymMV is closely related to the <i>Narcissus mosaic virus</i> (NMV), <i>Scallion virus X</i> (SVX), <i>Pepino mosaic virus</i> (PepMV) and <i>Potato aucuba mosaic virus</i> (PAMV). Different sets of primers were used for the amplification of different regions of the genome through RT-PCR and the amplified genes were cloned in a suitable vector. The full genome of the Indian isolate of CymMV from <i>Phaius tankervilliae</i> shares 96–97% similarity with isolates reported from other countries. It was found that the CP gene of CymMV shares a high similarity with each other and other potexviruses. One of the Indian isolates seems to be a recombinant formed by the intermolecular recombination of two other CymMV isolates. The phylogenetic analyses, Recombination Detection Program (RDP2) analyses and sequence alignment survey provided evidence for the occurrence of a recombination between an Indian isolate (AM055720) as the major parent, and a Korean type-2 isolate (AF016914) as the minor parent. Recombination was also observed between a Singapore isolate (U62963) as the major parent, and a Taiwan CymMV (AY571289) as the minor parent.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Wolbachia</i> is a ubiquitous, Gram-negative, vertically transmitted, alpha-proteobacterium that causes an array of reproductive abnormalities including cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization of genetic males, parthenogenesis in a number of insect species, among others. <i>Wolbachia</i> is now being exploited as an agent for pest and vector control. Previous surveys indicated that it is commonly seen in 16–76% of arthropods. In this paper, using polymerase chain reaction assay based on specific amplification of the <i>ftsZ</i>-A and -B supergroup <i>Wolbachia</i> gene fragments, we found that 30% of insects and pests screened were positive for <i>Wolbachia</i>. Among them 66.7% harbour double <i>Wolbachia</i> infection, while 33.3% harbour single <i>Wolbachia</i> infection. These results indicate widespread infection with both double and single <i>Wolbachia</i>, and provide a wealth of information to exploit this endobacterium for the management of pests and vectors.</p>

				<title>Strong and weak hydrogen bonds in drug–DNA complexes: A statistical analysis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0677-0691</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A statistical analysis of strong and weak hydrogen bonds in the minor groove of DNA was carried out for a set of 70 drug–DNA complexes. The terms `strong’ and `weak’ pertain to the inherent strengths and weakness of the donor and acceptor fragments rather than to any energy considerations. The dataset was extracted from the protein data bank (PDB). The analysis was performed with an in-house software, hydrogen bond analysis tool (HBAT). In addition to strong hydrogen bonds such as O−H···O and N−H···O, the ubiquitous presence of weak hydrogen bonds such as C−H···O is implicated in molecular recognition. On an average, there are 1.4 weak hydrogen bonds for every strong hydrogen bond. For both categories of interaction, the N(3) of purine and the O(2) of pyrimidine are favoured acceptors. Donor multifurcation is common with the donors generally present in the drug molecules, and shared by hydrogen bond acceptors in the minor groove. Bifurcation and trifurcation are most commonly observed. The metrics for strong hydrogen bonds are consistent with established trends. The geometries are variable for weak hydrogen bonds. A database of recognition geometries for 26 literature amidinium-based inhibitors of Human African Trypanosomes (HAT) was generated with a docking study using seven inhibitors which occur in published crystal structures included in the list of 70 complexes mentioned above, and 19 inhibitors for which the drug–DNA complex crystal structures are unknown. The virtual geometries so generated correlate well with published activities for these 26 inhibitors, justifying our assumption that strong and weak hydrogen bonds are optimized in the active site.</p>

				<title>Ion pairs in non-redundant protein structures</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0693-0704</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ion pairs contribute to several functions including the activity of catalytic triads, fusion of viral membranes, stability in thermophilic proteins and solvent–protein interactions. Furthermore, they have the ability to affect the stability of protein structures and are also a part of the forces that act to hold monomers together. This paper deals with the possible ion pair combinations and networks in 25% and 90% non-redundant protein chains. Different types of ion pairs present in various secondary structural elements are analysed. The ion pairs existing between different subunits of multisubunit protein structures are also computed and the results of various analyses are presented in detail. The protein structures used in the analysis are solved using X-ray crystallography, whose resolution is better than or equal to 1.5 Å and R-factor better than or equal to 20%. This study can, therefore, be useful for analyses of many protein functions. It also provides insights into the better understanding of the architecture of protein structure.</p>

				<title>Molecular cloning and expression of the C-terminus of spider flagelliform silk protein from <i>Araneus ventricosus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0705-0712</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A cDNA coding for the C-terminus of spider flagelliform silk protein (AvFlag) was cloned from <i>Araneus ventricosus</i>. Analysis of the cDNA sequence shows that the C-terminus of AvFlag consists of 167 amino acids of a repetitive region and 87 amino acids of a C-terminal non-repetitive region. The peptide motifs found in spider flagelliform silk proteins, GPGGX and GGX, were conserved in the repetitive region of AvFlag. Phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that AvFlag belongs to the spider flagelliform silk proteins. The AvFlag cDNA was expressed as a 28 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect cells. As a new expression approach for spider silk protein, the combination of polyhedrin and AvFlag creates a polyhedrin AvFlag fusion protein (61 kDa) that is produced as recombinant polyhedra; this provides a basis for the source of spider silk proteins for various applications.</p>

				<title>Diversity and evolutionary relationship of nucleotide binding site-encoding disease-resistance gene analogues in sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i> Lam.)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0713-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most plant disease-resistance genes (𝑅-genes) isolated so far encode proteins with a nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain and belong to a superfamily. NBS domains related to 𝑅-genes show a highly conserved backbone of an amino acid motif, which makes it possible to isolate resistance gene analogues (RGAs) by degenerate primers. Degenerate primers based on the conserved motif (P-loop and GLPL) of the NBS domain from 𝑅-genes were used to isolate RGAs from the genomic DNA of sweet potato cultivar Qingnong no. 2. Five distinct clusters of RGAs (22 sequences) with the characteristic NBS representing a highly diverse sample were identified in sweet potato genomic DNA. Sequence identity among the 22 RGA nucleotide sequences ranged from 41.2% to 99.4%, while the deduced amino acid sequence identity from the 22 RGAs ranged from 20.6% to 100%. The analysis of sweet potato RGA sequences suggested mutation as the primary source of diversity. The phylogenetic analyses for RGA nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acids showed that RGAs from sweet potato were classified into two distinct groups—toll and interleukin receptor-1 (TIR)-NBS-LRR and non-TIR-NBS-LRR. The high degree of similarity between sweet potato RGAs and NBS sequences derived from 𝑅-genes cloned from tomato, tobacco, flax and potato suggest an ancestral relationship. Further studies showed that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution within families was low. These data obtained from sweet potato suggest that the evolution of NBS-encoding sequences in sweet potato occur by the gradual accumulation of mutations leading to purifying selection and slow rates of divergence within distinct 𝑅-gene families.</p>

				<title>Selenium acts as an insulin-like molecule for the down-regulation of diabetic symptoms via endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin signalling proteins in diabetes-induced non-obese diabetic mice</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0723-0735</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To investigate whether selenium (Sel) treatment would impact on the onset of diabetes, we examined serum biochemical components including glucose and insulin, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and insulin signalling proteins, hepatic C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) expression and DNA fragmentation in diabetic and non-diabetic conditions of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We conclude that</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Sel treatment induced insulin-like effects in lowering serum glucose level in Sel-treated NOD mice,</li>
						<li>Sel-treated mice had significantly decreased serum biochemical components associated with liver damage and lipid metabolism,</li>
						<li>Sel treatment led to the activation of the ER stress signal through the phosphorylation of JNK and eIF2 protein and insulin signal mechanisms through the phosphorylation of Akt and PI3 kinase, and</li>
						<li>Sel-treated mice were significantly relieved apoptosis of liver tissues indicated by DNA fragmentation assay in the diabetic NOD group.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>These results suggest that Sel compounds not only serve as insulin-like molecules for the downregulation of glucose level and the incidence of liver damage, but may also have the potential for the development of new drugs for the relief of diabetes by activating the ER stress and insulin signalling pathways.</p>

				<title>Synergy between verapamil and other multidrug -resistance modulators in model membranes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0737-0746</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Various cationic lipophilic compounds can reverse the multidrug resistance of cancer cells. Possible interaction between these compounds, which are known as modulators, has been assessed by measuring leakage of Sulphan blue from anionic liposomes, induced both by verapamil alone and by verapamil in combination with diltiazem, quinine, thioridazine or clomipramine. An equation was derived to quantify the permeation doses and Hill coefficients of the drugs and mixtures between them by simultaneous fitting of the experimental data. The interaction was tested by two methods, the competition plot and the isobole method; both showed synergy between verapamil and each of diltiazem, quinine and thioridazine. The dose factor of potentiation for verapamil determined within membranes was 4.0 &#177; 0.4 with diltiazem, 3.2 &#177; 0.4 with quinine and 2.4 &#177; 0.3 with thioridazine. The results suggest that the effectiveness of reversing multidrug resistance may be increased with modulators such as verapamil and diltiazem that have a much greater effect in combination than what would be expected from their effects when considered separately.</p>

				<title>Diet-dependent depletion of queuosine in tRNAs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> does not lead to a developmental block</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0747-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Queuosine (Q), a hypermodified nucleoside, occurs at the wobble position of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with GUN anticodons. In eubacteria, absence of Q affects messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and reduces the virulence of certain pathogenic strains. In animal cells, changes in the abundance of Q have been shown to correlate with diverse phenomena including stress tolerance, cell proliferation and tumour growth but the function of Q in animals is poorly understood. Animals are thought to obtain Q (or its analogues) as a micronutrient from dietary sources such as gut microflora. However, the difficulty of maintaining animals under bacteria-free conditions on Q-deficient diets has severely hampered the study of Q metabolism and function in animals. In this study, we show that as in higher animals, tRNAs in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> are modified by Q and its sugar derivatives. When the worms were fed on Q-deficient <i>Escherichia coli</i>, Q modification was absent from the worm tRNAs suggesting that <i>C. elegans</i> lacks a <i>de novo</i> pathway of Q biosynthesis. The inherent advantages of <i>C. elegans</i> as a model organism, and the simplicity of conferring a Q-deficient phenotype on it make it an ideal system to investigate the function of Q modification in tRNA.</p>

				<title>Hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibitory activities of the herbal formulation <i>Triphala guggulu</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0755-0761</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Myrrh (<i>guggulu</i>) oleoresin from the <i>Commiphora mukul</i> tree is an important component of antiarthritic drugs in Ayurvedic medicine. Clinical data suggest that elevated levels of hyaluronidase and collagenase type 2 enzymes contribute significantly to cartilage degradation. <i>Triphala guggulu</i> (TG) is a <i>guggulu</i>-based formulation used for the treatment of arthritis. We assessed the chondroprotective potential of TG by examining its effects on the activities of pure hyaluronidase and collagenase type 2 enzymes. <i>Triphala shodith guggulu</i> (TSG), an intermediate in the production of TG, was also examined. A spectrophotometric method was used to assay Hyaluronidase activity, and to detect potential Hyaluronidase inhibitors. Aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extracts of TSG showed weak but dose-dependent inhibition of hyaluronidase activity. In contrast, the TG formulation was 50 times more potent than the TSG extract with respect to hyaluronidase inhibitory activity. A validated X-ray film-based assay was used to measure the gelatinase activity of pure collagenase type 2. Hydro-alcoholic extracts of the TG formulation were 4 times more potent than TSG with respect to collagenase inhibitory activity. Components of <i>Triphala</i> were also evaluated for their inhibitory activities on hyaluronidase and collagenase. This is the first report to show that the T2 component of <i>Triphala</i> (<i>T. chebula</i>) is a highly potent hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibitor. Thus, the TG formulation inhibits two major enzymes that can degrade cartilage matrix. Our study provides the first <i>in vitro</i> preclinical evidence of the chondroprotective properties of TG.</p>

				<title>Cytological evidence for population-specific sex chromosome heteromorphism in Palaearctic green toads (Amphibia, Anura)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0763-0768</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A chromosome study was carried out on a number of European and Central Asiatic diploid green toad populations by means of standard and various other chromosome banding and staining methods (Ag-NOR-, Q-, CMA<sub>3</sub>-, late replicating [LR] banding pattern, C- and sequential C-banding + CMA<sub>3</sub> + DAPI). This study revealed the remarkable karyological uniformity of specimens from all populations, with the only exception being specimens from a Moldavian population, where one chromosome pair was heteromorphic. Though similar in shape, size and with an identical heterochromatin distribution, the difference in the heteromorphic pair was due to a large inverted segment on its long arms. This heteromorphism was restricted to females, suggesting a female heterogametic sex chromosome system of ZZ/ZW type at a very early step of differentiation.</p>

				<title>Presence of two types of flowers with respect to nectar sugar in two gregariously flowering species</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0769-0774</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many species of animal-pollinated flowers are known to vary widely in the nectar content of flowers. Some proportion of flowers in many species is apparently nectarless, and such flowers are believed to be ‘cheaters’. Cheating may explain a part of the variability in nectar content. If cheating exists as a qualitatively different strategy then we expect bimodality in the distribution of nectar content of flowers. It has been shown in a multispecies study that gregarious species have a higher proportion of cheater flowers. We studied the frequency distribution of total nectar sugar in two gregariously flowering species <i>Lantana camara</i> and <i>Utricularia purpurascens</i>, which differed in other floral and ecological characters. At the population level, both the species showed significant bimodality in the total sugar content of flowers. The obvious sources of heterogeneity in the data did not explain bimodality. In <i>Lantana camara</i>, bimodality was observed within flowers of some of the individual plants sampled. In <i>Utricularia purpurascens</i> the proportion of nectarless flowers was more in high-density patches, suggesting that the gregariousness hypothesis may work within a species as well. The results support the hypothesis of cheating as a distinct strategy since two distinct types of flowers were observed in both the species. The effect of density in <i>Utricularia purpurascens</i> also supports the gregariousness hypothesis.</p>

				<title>Sociobiology of biodegradation and the role of predatory protozoa in biodegrading communities</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0775-0780</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Predatory protozoa are known to enhance biodegradation by bacteria in a variety of systems including rumen. This is apparently counterintuitive since many protozoa do not themselves produce extracellular degradative enzymes and prey upon bacterial degraders. We propose a mechanism of protozoal enhancement of bacterial biodegradation based on the sociobiology of biodegradation. Since extracellular enzyme production by degraders involves a cost to the bacterial cell, cheaters that do not make the enzyme will have a selective advantage. In the presence of cheaters, degraders that physically attach to water-insoluble substrate will have a selective advantage over free-floating degraders. On the other hand, cheaters will benefit by being free floaters since they consume the solubilized products of extracellular enzymes. Predatory ciliated protozoa are more likely to consume free-floating cheaters. Thus, due to protozoan predation a control is exerted on the cheater population. We illustrate the dynamics of such a system with the help of a computer simulation model. Available data on rumen and other biodegradation systems involving protozoa are compatible with the assumptions and predictions of the model.</p>

				<title>Patterns of species discovery in the Western Ghats, a megadiversity hot spot in India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0781-0790</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Even since Linnaeus, naturalists and taxonomists have been systematically describing species new to science. Besides indicating gaps in taxonomic effort, understanding the temporal patterns of species discovery could help in identifying drivers that determine discovery. In this study we report the patterns of discovery of eight taxa – birds, butterflies, frogs, tiger beetles, grasses, asters, ferns and orchids – in the Western Ghats, a megadiversity centre in India. Our results indicate that the discovery curves for birds and butterflies have been saturated while those for frogs and grasses continue to increase. Within each taxon, the major drivers of discovery were commonness of the species and their size. The average years taken for discovery across taxa were directly related to the per cent endemicity and species richness of the taxa. We discuss the trajectories of discovery with respect to rarity or endemicity of the species and life history features, and the implications these might have for strategizing the discovery process in India.</p>

				<title>Do we live in a largely top-down regulated world ?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0791-0796</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on a review of mostly recent literature for a public lecture, the question is discussed whether we live in a largely ``top-down” regulated world rather than one formed ``bottom-up” by the resources for plant and animal growth. Of course, the top-down mechanism is predicated by bottom-up production, especially by the plants. Examples for the effects of grazing and predation for the land and the open sea, but including coral reefs, are discussed. The answer to the question posed by the title is affirmative. Ecosystems altered by man and urgent needs for marine conservation are briefly treated.</p>

					<p>We use nonlinear time series analysis methods to analyse the dynamics of the sound-producing apparatus of the katydid <i>Neoconocephalus robustus</i>. We capture the dynamics by analysing a recording of the singing activity. First, we reconstruct the phase space from the sound recording and test it against determinism and stationarity. After confirming determinism and stationarity, we show that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the series is positive, which is a strong indicator for the chaotic behaviour of the system. We discuss that methods of nonlinear time series analysis can yield instructive insights and foster the understanding of acoustic communication among insects.</p>

				<page>0809-0825</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Noncanonical base pairs in RNA have strong structural and functional implications but are currently not considered for secondary structure predictions. We present results of comparative <i>ab initio</i> studies of stabilities and interaction energies for the three standard and 24 selected unusual RNA base pairs reported in the literature. Hydrogen added models of isolated base pairs, with heavy atoms frozen in their ‘away from equilibrium’ geometries, built from coordinates extracted from NDB, were geometry optimized using HF/6-31G** basis set, both before and after unfreezing the heavy atoms. Interaction energies, including BSSE and deformation energy corrections, were calculated, compared with respective single point MP2 energies, and correlated with occurrence frequencies and with types and geometries of hydrogen bonding interactions. Systems having two or more N-H…O/N hydrogen bonds had reasonable interaction energies which correlated well with respective occurrence frequencies and highlighted the possibility of some of them playing important roles in improved secondary structure prediction methods. Several of the remaining base pairs with one N-H…O/N and/or one C-H…O/N interactions respectively, had poor interaction energies and negligible occurrences. High geometry variations on optimization of some of these were suggestive of their conformational switch like characteristics.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of DNA–binding loss upon single-point mutation in p53</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0827-0839</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Over 50% of all human cancers involve p53 mutations, which occur mostly in the sequence−specific DNA−binding central domain (p53c), yielding little/non–detectable affinity to the DNA consensus site. Despite our current understanding of protein−DNA recognition, the mechanism(s) underlying the loss in protein−DNA binding affinity/specificity upon single−point mutation are not well understood. Our goal is to identify the common factors governing the DNA−binding loss of p53c upon substitution of Arg 273 to His or Cys, which are abundant in human tumours. By computing the free energies of wild–type and mutant p53c binding to DNA and decomposing them into contributions from individual residues, the DNA−binding loss upon charge/noncharge–conserving mutation of Arg 273 was attributed not only to the loss of DNA phosphate contacts, but also to longer–range structural changes caused by the loss of the Asp 281 salt–bridge. The results herein and in previous works suggest that Asp 281 plays a critical role in the sequence−specific DNA−binding function of p53c by</p> 
					<ol>
						<li>orienting Arg 273 and Arg 280 in an optimal position to interact with the phosphate and base groups of the consensus DNA, respectively, and</li>

				<title>Incorporating evolution of transcription factor binding sites into annotated alignments</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0841-0850</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is essential to elucidate putative regulatory mechanisms. A common strategy is to combine cross-species conservation with single sequence TFBS annotation to yield ``conserved TFBSs”. Most current methods in this field adopt a multi-step approach that segregates the two aspects. Again, it is widely accepted that the evolutionary dynamics of binding sites differ from those of the surrounding sequence. Hence, it is desirable to have an approach that explicitly takes this factor into account. Although a plethora of approaches have been proposed for the prediction of conserved TFBSs, very few explicitly model TFBS evolutionary properties, while additionally being multi-step. Recently, we introduced a novel approach to simultaneously align and annotate conserved TFBSs in a pair of sequences. Building upon the standard Smith-Waterman algorithm for local alignments, SimAnn introduces additional states for profiles to output extended alignments or annotated alignments. That is, alignments with parts annotated as gaplessly aligned TFBSs (pair-profile hits) are generated. Moreover, the pair-profile related parameters are derived in a sound statistical framework.</p>
					<p>In this article, we extend this approach to explicitly incorporate evolution of binding sites in the SimAnn framework. We demonstrate the extension in the theoretical derivations through two position-specific evolutionary models, previously used for modelling TFBS evolution. In a simulated setting, we provide a proof of concept that the approach works given the underlying assumptions, as compared to the original work. Finally, using a real dataset of experimentally verified binding sites in human-mouse sequence pairs, we compare the new approach (eSimAnn) to an existing multi-step tool that also considers TFBS evolution.</p>
					<p>Although it is widely accepted that binding sites evolve differently from the surrounding sequences, most comparative TFBS identification methods do not explicitly consider this. Additionally, predic tion of conserved binding sites is carried out in a multi-step approach that segregates alignment from TFBS annotation. In this paper, we demonstrate how the simultaneous alignment and annotation approach of SimAnn can be further extended to incorporate TFBS evolutionary relationships. We study how alignments and binding site predictions interplay at varying evolutionary distances and for various profile qualities.</p>

				<title>Identification and annotation of promoter regions in microbial genome sequences on the basis of DNA stability</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0851-0862</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analysis of various predicted structural properties of promoter regions in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic genomes had earlier indicated that they have several common features, such as lower stability, higher curvature and less bendability, when compared with their neighboring regions. Based on the difference in stability between neighboring upstream and downstream regions in the vicinity of experimentally determined transcription start sites, a promoter prediction algorithm has been developed to identify prokaryotic promoter sequences in whole genomes. The average free energy (E) over known promoter sequences and the difference (D) between E and the average free energy over the entire genome (G) are used to search for promoters in the genomic sequences. Using these cutoff values to predict promoter regions across entire <i>Escherichia coli</i> genome, we achieved a reliability of 70% when the predicted promoters were cross verified against the 960 transcription start sites (TSSs) listed in the Ecocyc database. Annotation of the whole <i>E. coli</i> genome for promoter region could be carried out with 49% accuracy. The method is quite general and it can be used to annotate the promoter regions of other prokaryotic genomes.</p>

				<title>Evolutionary insights from suffix array-based genome sequence analysis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0871-0881</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gene and protein sequence analyses, central components of studies in modern biology are easily amenable to string matching and pattern recognition algorithms. The growing need of analysing whole genome sequences more efficiently and thoroughly, has led to the emergence of new computational methods. Suffix trees and suffix arrays are data structures, well known in many other areas and are highly suited for sequence analysis too. Here we report an improvement to the design of construction of suffix arrays. Enhancement in versatility and scalability, enabled by this approach, is demonstrated through the use of real-life examples.</p>
					<p>The scalability of the algorithm to whole genomes renders it suitable to address many biologically interesting problems. One example is the evolutionary insight gained by analysing unigrams, bi-grams and higher n-grams, indicating that the genetic code has a direct influence on the overall composition of the genome. Further, different proteomes have been analysed for the coverage of the possible peptide space, which indicate that as much as a quarter of the total space at the tetra-peptide level is left un-sampled in prokaryotic organisms, although almost all tri-peptides can be seen in one protein or another in a proteome. Besides, distinct patterns begin to emerge for the counts of particular tetra and higher peptides, indicative of a ‘meaning’ for tetra and higher n-grams.</p>
					<p>The toolkit has also been used to demonstrate the usefulness of identifying repeats in whole proteomes efficiently. As an example, 16 members of one COG, coded by the genome of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> H37Rv have been found to contain a repeating sequence of 300 amino acids.</p>

				<title>A method for computing the inter-residue interaction potentials for reduced amino acid alphabet</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0883-0889</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inter-residue potentials are extensively used in the design and evaluation of protein structures. However, dealing with all (20&#215;20) interactions becomes computationally difficult in extensive investigations. Hence, it is desirable to reduce the alphabet of 20 amino acids to a smaller number. Currently, several methods of reducing the residue types exist; however a critical assessment of these methods is not available. Towards this goal, here we review and evaluate different methods by comparing with the complete (20&#215;20) matrix of Miyazawa-Jernigan potential, including a method of grouping adopted by us, based on multi dimensional scaling (MDS). The second goal of this paper is the computation of inter-residue interaction energies for the reduced amino acid alphabet, which has not been explicitly addressed in the literature until now. By using a least squares technique, we present a systematic method of obtaining the interaction energy values for any type of grouping scheme that reduces the amino acid alphabet. This can be valuable in designing the protein structures.</p>

				<title>Protein mechanics: a route from structure to function</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0891-0898</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to better understand the mechanical properties of proteins, we have developed simulation tools which enable these properties to be analysed on a residue-by-residue basis. Although these calculations are relatively expensive with all-atom protein models, good results can be obtained much faster using coarse-grained approaches. The results show that proteins are surprisingly heterogeneous from a mechanical point of view and that functionally important residues often exhibit unusual mechanical behaviour. This finding offers a novel means for detecting functional sites and also potentially provides a route for understanding the links between structure and function in more general terms.</p>

				<title>Protein local conformations arise from a mixture of Gaussian distributions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0899-0908</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The classical approaches for protein structure prediction rely either on homology of the protein sequence with a template structure or on <i>ab initio</i> calculations for energy minimization. These methods suffer from disadvantages such as the lack of availability of homologous template structures or intractably large conformational search space, respectively. The recently proposed fragment library based approaches first predict the local structures, which can be used in conjunction with the classical approaches of protein structure prediction. The accuracy of the predictions is dependent on the quality of the fragment library. In this work, we have constructed a library of local conformation classes purely based on geometric similarity. The local conformations are represented using Geometric Invariants, properties that remain unchanged under transformations such as translation and rotation, followed by dimension reduction via principal component analysis. The local conformations are then modeled as a mixture of Gaussian probability distribution functions (PDF). Each one of the Gaussian PDF’s corresponds to a conformational class with the centroid representing the average structure of that class. We find 46 classes when we use an octapeptide as a unit of local conformation. The protein 3-D structure can now be described as a sequence of local conformational classes. Further, it was of interest to see whether the local conformations can be predicted from the amino acid sequences. To that end, we have analyzed the correlation between sequence features and the conformational classes.</p>

				<title>Exploring conformational space using a mean field technique with MOLS sampling</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0909-0920</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The computational identification of all the low energy structures of a peptide given only its sequence is not an easy task even for small peptides, due to the multiple-minima problem and combinatorial explosion. We have developed an algorithm, called the MOLS technique, that addresses this problem, and have applied it to a number of different aspects of the study of peptide and protein structure. Conformational studies of oligopeptides, including loop sequences in proteins have been carried out using this technique. In general the calculations identified all the folds determined by previous studies, and in addition picked up other energetically favorable structures. The method was also used to map the energy surface of the peptides. In another application, we have combined the MOLS technique, using it to generate a library of low energy structures of an oligopeptide, with a genetic algorithm to predict protein structures. The method has also been applied to explore the conformational space of loops in protein structures. Further, it has been applied to the problem of docking a ligand in its receptor site, with encouraging results.</p>

				<title>Analysis on sliding helices and strands in protein structural comparisons: A case study with protein kinases</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0921-0928</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein structural alignments are generally considered as ‘golden standard’ for the alignment at the level of amino acid residues. In this study we have compared the quality of pairwise and multiple structural alignments of about 5900 homologous proteins from 718 families of known 3-D structures. We observe shifts in the alignment of regular secondary structural elements (helices and strands) between pairwise and multiple structural alignments. The differences between pairwise and multiple structural alignments within helical and 𝛽-strand regions often correspond to 4 and 2 residue positions respectively. Such shifts correspond approximately to “one turn” of these regular secondary structures. We have performed manual analysis explicitly on the family of protein kinases. We note shifts of one or two turns in helix-helix alignments obtained using pairwise and multiple structural alignments. Investigations on the quality of the equivalent helix-helix, strand-strand pairs in terms of their residue side-chain accessibilities have been made. Our results indicate that the quality of the pairwise alignments is comparable to that of the multiple structural alignments and, in fact, is often better. We propose that pairwise alignment of protein structures should also be used in formulation of methods for structure prediction and evolutionary analysis.</p>

				<title>Use of secondary structural information and C𝛼-C𝛼 distance restraints to model protein structures with MODELLER</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0929-0936</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein secondary structure predictions and amino acid long range contact map predictions from primary sequence of proteins have been explored to aid in modelling protein tertiary structures. In order to evaluate the usefulness of secondary structure and 3D-residue contact prediction methods to model protein structures we have used the known Q3 (alpha-helix, beta-strands and irregular turns/loops) secondary structure information, along with residue-residue contact information as restraints for MODELLER. We present here results of our modelling studies on 30 best resolved single domain protein structures of varied lengths. The results shows that it is very difficult to obtain useful models even with 100% accurate secondary structure predictions and accurate residue contact predictions for up to 30% of residues in a sequence. The best models that we obtained for proteins of lengths 37, 70, 118, 136 and 193 amino acid residues are of RMSDs 4.17, 5.27, 9.12, 7.89 and 9.69, respectively. The results show that one can obtain better models for the proteins which have high percent of alpha-helix content. This analysis further shows that MODELLER restrain optimization program can be useful only if we have truly homologous structure(s) as a template where it derives numerous restraints, almost identical to the templates used. This analysis also clearly indicates that even if we satisfy several true residue-residue contact distances, up to 30% of their sequence length with fully known secondary structural information, we end up predicting model structures much distant from their corresponding native structures.</p>

				<title>ARC: Automated Resource Classifier for agglomerative functional classification of prokaryotic proteins using annotation texts</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0937-0945</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Functional classification of proteins is central to comparative genomics. The need for algorithms tuned to enable integrative interpretation of analytical data is felt globally. The availability of a general, automated software with built-in flexibility will significantly aid this activity. We have prepared ARC (Automated Resource Classifier), which is an open source software meeting the user requirements of flexibility. The default classification scheme based on keyword match is agglomerative and directs entries into any of the 7 basic non-overlapping functional classes: Cell wall, Cell membrane and Transporters ($\mathcal{C}$), Cell division ($\mathcal{D}$), Information ($\mathcal{I}$), Translocation ($\mathcal{L}$), Metabolism ($\mathcal{M}$), Stress($\mathcal{R}$), Signal and communication($\mathcal{S}$) and 2 ancillary classes: Others ($\mathcal{O}$) and Hypothetical ($\mathcal{H}$). The keyword library of ARC was built serially by first drawing keywords from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12. In subsequent steps, this library was further enriched by collecting terms from archaeal representative <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i>, Gene Ontology, and Gene Symbols. ARC is 94.04% successful on 6,75,663 annotated proteins from 348 prokaryotes. Three examples are provided to illuminate the current perspectives on mycobacterial physiology and costs of proteins in 333 prokaryotes. ARC is available at <i>http://arc.igib.res.in</i>.</p>

				<title>Synonymous codon usage in different protein secondary structural classes of human genes: Implication for increased non-randomness of GC<sub>3</sub> rich genes towards protein stability</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0947-0963</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relationship between the synonymous codon usage and different protein secondary structural classes were investigated using 401 <i>Homo sapiens</i> proteins extracted from Protein Data Bank (PDB). A simple Chi-square test was used to assess the significance of deviation of the observed and expected frequencies of 59 codons at the level of individual synonymous families in the four different protein secondary structural classes. It was observed that synonymous codon families show non-randomness in codon usage in four different secondary structural classes. However, when the genes were classified according to their GC<sub>3</sub> levels there was an increase in non-randomness in high GC<sub>3</sub> group of genes. The non-randomness in codon usage was further tested among the same protein secondary structures belonging to four different protein folding classes of high GC<sub>3</sub> group of genes. The results show that in each of the protein secondary structural unit there exist some synonymous family that shows class specific codonusage pattern. Moreover, there is an increased non-random behaviour of synonymous codons in sheet structure of all secondary structural classes in high GC<sub>3</sub> group of genes. Biological implications of these results have been discussed.</p>

				<page>0965-0977</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The biological cell, a natural self-contained unit of prime biological importance, is an enormously complex machine that can be understood at many levels. A higher-level perspective of the entire cell requires integration of various features into coherent, biologically meaningful descriptions. There are some efforts to model cells based on their genome, proteome or metabolome descriptions. However, there are no established methods as yet to describe cell morphologies, capture similarities and differences between different cells or between healthy and disease states. Here we report a framework to model various aspects of a cell and integrate knowledge encoded at different levels of abstraction, with cell morphologies at one end to atomic structures at the other. The different issues that have been addressed are ontologies, feature description and model building. The framework describes dotted representations and tree data structures to integrate diverse pieces of data and parametric models enabling size, shape and location descriptions. The framework serves as a first step in integrating different levels of data available for a biological cell and has the potential to lead to development of computational models in our pursuit to model cell structure and function, from which several applications can flow out.</p>

				<title>Sub classification and targeted characterization of prophage-encoded two-component cell lysis cassette</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0979-0990</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bacteriophage induced lysis of host bacterial cell is mediated by a two component cell lysis cassette comprised of holin and lysozyme. Prophages are integrated forms of bacteriophages in bacterial genomes providing a repertoire for bacterial evolution. Analysis using the prophage database (<i>http://bicmku.in:8082</i>) constructed by us showed 47 prophages were associated with putative two component cell lysis genes. These proteins cluster into four different subgroups. In this process, a putative holin (<i>essd</i>) and endolysin (<i>ybcS</i>), encoded by the defective lambdoid prophage DLP12 was found to be similar to two component cell lysis genes in functional bacteriophages like p21 and P1. The holin <i>essd</i> was found to have a characteristic dual start motif with two transmembrane regions and C-terminal charged residues as in class II holins. Expression of a fusion construct of <i>essd</i> in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed slow growth. However, under appropriate conditions, this protein could be over expressed and purified for structure function studies. The second component of the cell lysis cassette, <i>ybcS</i>, was found to have an N-terminal SAR (Signal Arrest Release) transmembrane domain. The construct of <i>ybcS</i> has been over expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and the purified protein was functional, exhibiting lytic activity against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhi</i> cell wall substrate. Such targeted sequence-structure-function characterization of proteins encoded by cryptic prophages will help understand the contribution of prophage proteins to bacterial evolution.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0991-0997</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The p53 protein is well-known for its tumour suppressor function. The p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop constitutes the core module of a network of regulatory interactions activated under cellular stress. In normal cells, the level of p53 proteins is kept low by MDM2, i.e. MDM2 negatively regulates the activity of p53. In the case of DNA damage, the p53-mediated pathways are activated leading to cell cycle arrest and repair of the DNA. If repair is not possible due to excessive damage, the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway is activated bringing about cell death. In this paper, we give an overview of our studies on the p53-MDM2 module and the associated pathways from a systems biology perspective. We discuss a number of key predictions, related to some specific aspects of cell cycle arrest and cell death, which could be tested in experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a medical condition associated with abnormally high levels of glucose (or sugar) in the blood. Keeping this view, we demonstrate the phylogenetic motifs (PMs) identification in type 2 diabetes mellitus very likely corresponding to protein functional sites. In this article, we have identified PMs for all the candidate genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glycine 310 remains conserved for glucokinase and potassium channel KCNJ11. Isoleucine 137 was conserved for insulin receptor and regulatory subunit of a phosphorylating enzyme. Whereas residues valine, leucine, methionine were highly conserved for insulin receptor. Occurrence of proline was very high for calpain 10 gene and glucose transporter</p>

				<title>The next step in biology: A periodic table?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1005-1008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Systems biology is an approach to explain the behaviour of a system in relation to its individual components. Synthetic biology uses key hierarchical and modular concepts of systems biology to engineer novel biological systems. In my opinion the next step in biology is to use molecule-to-phenotype data using these approaches and integrate them in the form a periodic table. A periodic table in biology would provide chassis to classify, systematize and compare diversity of component properties vis-a-vis system behaviour. Using periodic table it could be possible to compute higher-level interactions from component properties. This paper examines the concept of building a bio-periodic table using protein fold as the fundamental unit.</p>

				<title>Modularized study of human calcium signalling pathway</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1009-1017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Signalling pathways are complex biochemical networks responsible for reg ulation of numerous cellular functions. These networks function by serial and successive interactions among a large number of vital biomolecules and chemical compounds. For deciphering and analysing the underlying mechanism of such networks, a modularized study is quite helpful. Here we propose an algorithm for modularization of calcium signalling pathway of <i>H. sapiens</i>. The idea that ``a node whose function is dependant on maximum number of other nodes tends to be the center of a sub network” is used to divide a large signalling network into smaller sub networks. Inclusion of node(s) into sub networks(s) is dependant on the outdegree of the node(s). Here outdegree of a node refers to the number of re lations of the considered node lying outside the constructed sub network. Node(s) having more than c relations lying outside the expanding subnetwork have to be excluded from it. Here 𝑐 is a specified variable based on user preference, which is finally fixed during adjustments of created subnetworks, so that certain biological significance can be conferred on them.</p>

				<title>Gene ordering in partitive clustering using microarray expressions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1019-1025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A central step in the analysis of gene expression data is the identification of groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns. Clustering and ordering the genes using gene expression data into homogeneous groups was shown to be useful in functional annotation, tissue classification, regulatory motif identification, and other applications. Although there is a rich literature on gene ordering in hierarchical clustering framework for gene expression analysis, there is no work addressing and evaluating the importance of gene ordering in partitive clustering framework, to the best knowledge of the authors. Outside the framework of hierarchical clustering, different gene ordering algorithms are applied on the whole data set, and the domain of partitive clustering is still unexplored with gene ordering approaches. A new hybrid method is proposed for ordering genes in each of the clusters obtained from partitive clustering solution, using microarray gene expressions. Two existing algorithms for optimally ordering cities in travelling salesman problem (TSP), namely, FRAG_GALK and Concorde, are hybridized individually with self organizing MAP to show the importance of gene ordering in partitive clustering framework. We validated our hybrid approach using yeast and fibroblast data and showed that our approach improves the result quality of partitive clustering solution, by identifying subclusters within big clusters, grouping functionally correlated genes within clusters, minimization of summation of gene expression distances, and the maximization of biological gene ordering using MIPS categorization. Moreover, the new hybrid approach, finds comparable or sometimes superior biological gene order in less computation time than those obtained by optimal leaf ordering in hierarchical clustering solution.</p>

				<title>Analysis of breast cancer progression using principal component analysis and clustering</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1027-1039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We develop a new technique to analyse microarray data which uses a combination of principal components analysis and consensus ensemble 𝑘-clustering to find robust clusters and gene markers in the data. We apply our method to a public microarray breast cancer dataset which has expression levels of genes in normal samples as well as in three pathological stages of disease; namely, atypical ductal hyperplasia or ADH, ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> or DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma or IDC. Our method averages over clustering techniques and data perturbation to find stable, robust clusters and gene markers. We identify the clusters and their pathways with distinct subtypes of breast cancer (Luminal, Basal and Her2+). We confirm that the cancer phenotype develops early (in early hyperplasia or ADH stage) and find from our analysis that each subtype progresses from ADH to DCIS to IDC along its own specific pathway, as if each was a distinct disease.</p>

				<title>Multiplicity of carbohydrate-binding sites in 𝛽-prism fold lectins: occurrence and possible evolutionary implications</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1089-1110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 𝛽-prism II fold lectins of known structure, all from monocots, invariably have three carbohydrate-binding sites in each subunit/domain. Until recently, 𝛽-prism I fold lectins of known structure were all from dicots and they exhibited one carbohydrate-binding site per subunit/domain. However, the recently determined structure of the 𝛽-prism fold I lectin from banana, a monocot, has two very similar carbohydrate-binding sites. This prompted a detailed analysis of all the sequences appropriate for two-lectin folds and which carry one or more relevant carbohydrate-binding motifs. The very recent observation of a 𝛽-prism I fold lectin, griffithsin, with three binding sites in each domain further confirmed the need for such an analysis. The analysis demonstrates substantial diversity in the number of binding sites unrelated to the taxonomical position of the plant source. However, the number of binding sites and the symmetry within the sequence exhibit reasonable correlation. The distribution of the two families of 𝛽-prism fold lectins among plants and the number of binding sites in them, appear to suggest that both of them arose through successive gene duplication, fusion and divergent evolution of the same primitive carbohydrate-binding motif involving a Greek key. Analysis with sequences in individual Greek keys as independent units lends further support to this conclusion. It would seem that the preponderance of three carbohydrate-binding sites per domain in monocot lectins, particularly those with the 𝛽-prism II fold, is related to the role of plant lectins in defence.</p>

				<title>Human cytomegalovirus <i>UL145</i> gene is highly conserved among clinical strains</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1111-1118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a ubiquitous human pathogen, is the leading cause of birth defects in newborns. A region (referred to as UL/b&#8242;) present in the Toledo strain of HCMV and low-passage clinical isolates) contains 22 additional genes, which are absent in the highly passaged laboratory strain AD169. One of these genes, <i>UL145</i> open reading frame (ORF), is located between the highly variable genes <i>UL144</i> and <i>UL146</i>. To assess the structure of the <i>UL145</i> gene, the <i>UL145</i> ORF was amplified by PCR and sequenced from 16 low-passage clinical isolates and 15 non-passage strains from suspected congenitally infected infants. Nine <i>UL145</i> sequences previously published in the GenBank were used for sequence comparison. The identities of the gene and the similarities of its putative protein among all strains were 95.9–100% and 96.6–100%, respectively. The post-translational modification motifs of the <i>UL145</i> putative protein in clinical strains were conserved, comprising the protein kinase C phosphorylation motif (PKC) and casein kinase II phosphorylation site (CK-II). We conclude that the structure of the <i>UL145</i> gene and its putative protein are relatively conserved among clinical strains, irrespective of whether the strains come from patients with different manifestations, from different areas of the world, or were passaged or not in human embryonic lung fibroblast (HELF) cells.</p>

				<title>Productivity and biochemical properties of green tea in response to full-length and functional fragments of HpaG<i>Xooc</i>, a harpin protein from the bacterial rice leaf streak pathogen <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i></title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Harpin proteins from plant pathogenic bacteria can stimulate hypersensitive cell death (HCD), drought tolerance, defence responses against pathogens and insects in plants, as well as enhance plant growth. Recently, we identified nine functional fragments of HpaG<sub>Xooc</sub>, a harpin protein from <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i>, the pathogen that causes bacterial leaf streak in rice. Fragments HpaG<sub>1–94</sub>, HpaG<sub>10–42</sub>, and HpaG<sub>62–138</sub>, which contain the HpaG<sub>Xooc</sub> regions of the amino acid sequence as indicated by the number spans, exceed the parent protein in promoting growth, pathogen defence and HCD in plants. Here we report improved productivity and biochemical properties of green tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) in response to the fragments tested in comparison with HpaG<sub>Xooc</sub> and an inactive protein control. Field tests suggested that the four proteins markedly increased the growth and yield of green tea, and increased the leaf content of tea catechols, a group of compounds that have relevance in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. In particular, HpaG<sub>1–94</sub> was more active than HpaG<sub>Xooc</sub> in expediting the growth of juvenile buds and leaves used as green tea material and increased the catechol content of processed teas. When tea shrubs were treated with HpaH<sub>Xooc</sub> and HpaG<sub>1–94</sub> compared with a control, green tea yields were over 55% and 39% greater, and leaf catechols were increased by more than 64% and 72%, respectively. The expression of three homologues of the expansin genes, which regulate plant cell growth, and the <i>CsCHS</i> gene encoding a tea chalcone synthase, which critically regulates the biosynthesis of catechols, were induced in germinal leaves of tea plants following treatment with HpaG<sub>1–94</sub> or HpaG<sub>Xooc</sub>. Higher levels of gene expression were induced by the application of HpaG<sub>1–94</sub> than HpaG<sub>Xooc</sub>. Our results suggest that the harpin protein, especially the functional fragment HpaG<sub>1–94</sub>, can be used to effectively increase the yield and improve the biochemical properties of green tea, a drink with medicinal properties.</p>

				<title>Cullin4B/E3-ubiquitin ligase negatively regulates 𝛽-catenin</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1133-1138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>𝛽-catenin is the key transducer of Wingless-type MMTV integration site family member (Wnt) signalling, upregulation of which is the cause of cancer of the colon and other tissues. In the absence of Wnt signals, 𝛽-catenin is targeted to ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated degradation. Here we present the functional characterization of E3-ubiquitin ligase encoded by <i>cul4B</i>. RNAi-mediated knock-down of Cul4B in a mouse cell line C3H T10 (1/2) results in an increase in 𝛽-catenin levels. Loss-of-function mutation in <i>Drosophila cul4</i> also shows increased 𝛽-catenin/Armadillo levels in developing embryos and displays a characteristic naked-cuticle phenotype. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that Cul4B and 𝛽-catenin are part of a signal complex in <i>Drosophila</i>, mouse and human. These preliminary results suggest a conserved role for Cul4B in the regulation of 𝛽-catenin levels.</p>

				<title>Age-dependent increase in green autofluorescence of blood erythrocytes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1139-1145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Green auto-fluorescence (GAF) of different age groups of mouse blood erythrocytes was determined by using a double <i>in vivo</i> biotinylation (DIB) technique that enables delineation of circulating erythrocytes of different age groups. A significant increase in GAF was seen for erythrocytes of old age group (age in circulation &#62; 40 days) as compared to young erythrocytes (age &#60; 15 days). Erythrocytes are removed from blood circulation by macrophages in the reticulo-endothelial system and depletion of macrophages results in an increased proportion of aged erythrocytes in the blood. When mice were depleted of macrophages for 7 days by administration of clodronate loaded liposomes, the overall GAF of erythrocytes increased significantly and this increase could be ascribed to an increase in GAF of the oldest population of erythrocytes. Using the DIB technique, the GAF of a cohort of blood erythrocyte generated during a 5 day window was tracked <i>in vivo</i>. GAF of the defined cohort of erythrocytes remained low till 40 days of age in circulation and then increased steeply till the end of the life span of erythrocytes. Taken together our results provide evidence for an age dependent increase in the GAF of blood erythrocytes that is accentuated by depletion of macrophages. Kinetics of changes in GAF of circulating erythrocytes with age has also been defined.</p>

				<title>Spectrin interactions with globin chains in the presence of phosphate metabolites and hydrogen peroxide: implications for thalassaemia</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1147-1151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have shown the differential interactions of the erythroid skeletal protein spectrin with the globin subunits of adult haemoglobin (HbA); these indicate a preference for 𝛼-globin over that for 𝛽-globin and intact HbA in an adenosine 5&#8242;-triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner. The presence of Mg/ATP led to an appreciable decrease in the binding affinity of the 𝛼-globin chain to spectrin and the overall yield of globin–spectrin cross-linked complexes formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Similar effects were also seen in the presence of 2-,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG), the other important phosphate metabolite of erythrocytes. The binding affinity and yield of cross-linked high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) formed under oxidative conditions were significantly higher in 𝛼-globin compared with intact haemoglobin, HbA and the 𝛽-globin chain. The results of this study indicate a possible correlation of the preferential spectrin binding of the 𝛼-globin chain over that of the 𝛽-globin in the haemoglobin disorder 𝛽-thalassaemia.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A vacuole Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter gene <i>TaNHX2</i> was obtained by screening the wheat cDNA library and by the 5&#8242;-RACE method. The expression of <i>TaNHX2</i> was induced in roots and leaves by treatment with NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), cold and abscisic acid (ABA). When expressed in a yeast mutant (𝛥<i>nhx1</i>), TaNHX2 suppressed the salt sensitivity of the mutant, which was deficient in vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, and caused partial recovery of growth of 𝛥<i>nhx1</i> in NaCl and LiCl media. The survival rate of yeast cells was improved by overexpressing the <i>TaNHX2</i> gene under NaCl, KCl, sorbitol and freezing stresses when compared with the control. The results imply that TaNHX2 might play an important role in salt and osmotic stress tolerance in plant cells.</p>

				<title>Link between the early calcium deposition in placenta and nanobaсterial-like infection</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1163-1168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The placenta is a vitally important organ in the regulation of embryonic development. That is why extensive calcium deposition [also named as pathological placental calcification (PPC)] could have serious negative consequences for the adequate growth of embryos. The nature and mechanism of PPC development has not been defined as yet. In the present investigation, we have tested the hypothesis that the molecular basis of PPC development consists of nanobacteria-induced calcification in infected female placenta. Electron microscopy findings support this hypothesis. The initial stage of micro-calcification may originate from the external surface of individual nanobacteria-like particles found mainly in placental extracellular matrix, where initial calcium deposition occurs as a needle surface deposition or as an amorphous-like surface precipitate. Further calcific propagation in placenta takes place in the newly formed macro-cavities, which are characterized by low electron density, possibly reflecting its liquid content around calcium deposition. The micro-cavities contain free nanobacterial-like particles, which may relate to atypical Gram-negative bacteria but not to apoptotic bodies by morphological characters and DNA/RNA distribution. We hypothesize that the increased placental calcification might be caused, at least in part, by nanobacterial infection.</p>

				<title><i>In silico</i> comparison of bacterial strains using mutual information</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1169-1184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fast-sequencing throughput methods have increased the number of completely sequenced bacterial genomes to about 400 by December 2006, with the number increasing rapidly. These include several strains. <i>In silico</i> methods of comparative genomics are of use in categorizing and phylogenetically sorting these bacteria. Various word-based tools have been used for quantifying the similarities and differences between entire genomes. The simple di-nucleotide frequency comparison, codon specificity and k-mer repeat detection are among some of the well-known methods.</p>
					<p>In this paper, we show that the Mutual Information function, which is a measure of correlations and a concept from Information Theory, is very effective in determining the similarities and differences among genome sequences of various strains of bacteria such as the plant pathogen <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, marine Cyanobacteria <i>Prochlorococcus marinus</i> or animal and human pathogens such as species of <i>Ehrlichia</i> and <i>Legionella</i>. The short-range three-base periodicity, small sequence repeats and long-range correlations taken together constitute a genome signature that can be used as a technique for identifying new bacterial strains with the help of strains already catalogued in the database.</p>
					<p>There have been several applications of using the Mutual Information function as a measure of correlations in genomics but this is the first whole genome analysis done to detect strain similarities and differences.</p>

				<title>Effect of the human follicle-stimulating hormone-binding inhibitor and its N-terminal fragment on follicle-stimulating hormone-induced progesterone secretion by granulosa cells <i>in vitro</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1185-1194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intrafollicular factors play an important role in folliculogenesis. The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-binding inhibitor (FSHBI), purified by our laboratory from human ovarian follicular fluid, has been shown to suppress ovulation and induce follicular atresia/apoptosis in mice as well as impair fertility in marmosets, the new world monkeys. The octapeptide, a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of human FSHBI (hFSHBI), has been synthesized and also shows FSHBI activity <i>in vitro</i>. In the present study, we have attempted to identify the mechanism of action of the peptide in granulosa cell cultures. Rat granulosa cell cultures were treated with varying concentrations of the octapeptide or partially purified hFSHBI (gel chromatography fraction hGF<sub>2</sub>) in the presence or absence of human FSH (hFSH) and the amount of progesterone (P<sub>4</sub>) secreted in the culture supernatants after 3 h/48 h was estimated. Both hGF<sub>2</sub> and the octapeptide failed to alter basal levels as well as 8-bromo cAMP-induced P<sub>4</sub> production, while FSH-induced P<sub>4</sub> secretion was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. These studies reveal that the octapeptide, a fragment of FSHBI, and the native protein have similar activity <i>in vitro</i> and both compounds alter FSH action at the receptor level upstream of cAMP formation.</p>

				<title>Structure and function of enzymes involved in the anaerobic degradation of L-threonine to propionate</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>1195-1206</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, L-threonine is cleaved non-oxidatively to propionate via 2-ketobutyrate by biodegradative threonine deaminase, 2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase (or pyruvate formate-lyase), phosphotransacetylase and propionate kinase. In the anaerobic condition, L-threonine is converted to the energy-rich keto acid and this is subsequently catabolised to produce ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation, providing a source of energy to the cells. Most of the enzymes involved in the degradation of L-threonine to propionate are encoded by the anaerobically regulated <i>tdc</i> operon. In the recent past, extensive structural and biochemical studies have been carried out on these enzymes by various groups. Besides detailed structural and functional insights, these studies have also shown the similarities and differences between the other related enzymes present in the metabolic network. In this paper, we review the structural and biochemical studies carried out on these enzymes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Although originally described as an intracellular second messenger, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) has recently been shown to be involved in several physiological and pathological functions as an extracellular mediator. S1P receptors are widely expressed and thought to regulate important functions in cell signalling. Recently, the role of S1P on the immune system has evoked great interest. In particular, several aspects of the effects on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as dendritic cells (DC) in mice and humans have been reported. In this review, we focus on the role played by S1P on the DC system and its effects in immune-related pathological states.</p>

				<title>Maternally derived egg yolk steroid hormones and sex determination: Review of a paradox in reptiles</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>1213-1220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the past decade, maternally derived steroid hormones in the egg yolk of oviparous vertebrates have been the focus of attention for their possible role in sex determination and hence, information on the consequences of maternal egg yolk steroids on sex determination has accumulated rapidly in reptiles and birds. Until recently, the observations were dominated by the idea that yolk steroids of maternal origin play an important role in sex determination of oviparous vertebrates. However, more recent studies have cast significant doubt on the above conclusion. These studies suggest instead that steroids may be present in the yolk simply as the byproduct of passive uptake during yolk formation or observed correlations might reflect embryonically produced rather than maternally derived steroids. Thus, the objective of the present review is</p>
					<ol>
						<li>to provide an overview of such paradoxical observations on the role of maternal yolk steroids in sex determination of reptiles,</li>
						<li>to identify and provide brief explanations for the observed paradoxical results, and</li>
						<li>to provide some future research directions.</li>

				<title>Historical evidence for a pre-Columbian presence of <i>Datura</i> in the Old World and implications for a first millennium transfer from the New World</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>1227-1244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Datura</i> (Solanaceae) is a small genus of plants that, for long, was thought to occur naturally in both the New and Old Worlds. However, recent studies indicate that all species in the genus originated in the Americas. This finding has prompted the conclusion that no species of <i>Datura</i> could have been present in the Old World prior to its introduction there by Europeans in the early 16th century CE. Further, the textual evidence traditionally cited in support of a pre-Columbian Old World presence of <i>Datura</i> species is suggested to be due to the misreading of classical Greek and Arabic sources. As a result, botanists generally accept the opinion that <i>Datura</i> species were transferred into the Old World in the post-Columbian period. While the taxonomic and geographic evidence for a New World origin for all the <i>Datura</i> species appears to be well supported, the assertion that <i>Datura</i> species were not known in the Old World prior to the 16th century is based on a limited examination of the pre-Columbian non-Anglo sources. We draw on old Arabic and Indic<sup>1</sup> texts and southern Indian iconographic representations to show that there is conclusive evidence for the pre-Columbian presence of at least one species of <i>Datura</i> in the Old World. Given the systematic evidence for a New World origin of the genus, the most plausible explanation for this presence is a relatively recent but pre-Columbian (probably first millennium CE) transfer of at least one <i>Datura</i> species, <i>D. metel</i>, into the Old World. Because <i>D. metel</i> is a domesticated species with a disjunct distribution, this might represent an instance of human-mediated transport from the New World to the Old World, as in the case of the sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>).</p>

				<title>Influence of mRNA decay rates on the computational prediction of transcription rate profiles from gene expression profiles</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1251-1262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The abundance of an mRNA species depends not only on the transcription rate at which it is produced, but also on its decay rate, which determines how quickly it is degraded. Both transcription rate and decay rate are important factors in regulating gene expression. With the advance of the age of genomics, there are a considerable number of gene expression datasets, in which the expression profiles of tens of thousands of genes are often non-uniformly sampled. Recently, numerous studies have proposed to infer the regulatory networks from expression profiles. Nevertheless, how mRNA decay rates affect the computational prediction of transcription rate profiles from expression profiles has not been well studied. To understand the influences, we present a systematic method based on a gene dynamic regulation model by taking mRNA decay rates, expression profiles and transcription profiles into account. Generally speaking, an expression profile can be regarded as a representation of a biological condition. The rationale behind the concept is that the biological condition is reflected in the changing of gene expression profile. Basically, the biological condition is either associated to the cell cycle or associated to the environmental stresses. The expression profiles of genes that belong to the former, so-called cell cycle data, are characterized by periodicity, whereas the expression profiles of genes that belong to the latter, so-called condition-specific data, are characterized by a steep change after a specific time without periodicity. In this paper, we examine the systematic method on the simulated expression data as well as the real expression data including yeast cell cycle data and condition-specific data (glucose-limitation data). The results indicate that mRNA decay rates do not significantly influence the computational prediction of transcription-rate profiles for cell cycle data. On the contrary, the magnitudes and shapes of transcription-rate profiles for condition specific data are significantly affected by mRNA decay rates. This analysis provides an opportunity for researchers to conduct future research on inferring regulatory networks computationally with available expression profiles under different biological conditions.</p>

				<title>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D/AUF1 interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1263-1272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) is one of the principal pre-mRNA-binding proteins found in human cells. The hnRNP L protein is fairly abundant. However, it is not restricted to the nucleus, and instead shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It is composed of 558 amino acid residues and harbours four loosely conserved RNP-consensus RNA-binding domains. In an attempt to characterize the interaction occurring between cellular proteins and hnRNP L, yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted using a HeLa cDNA library. Some of the cDNA clones were found to harbour a partial human hnRNP D/AUF1 cDNA (GeneBank accession number NM_031369). In this study, we determined that hnRNP L interacts specifically with the hnRNP D/AUF1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction was verified via an <i>in vitro</i> pull-down assay.</p>

				<title>GATA family of transcription factors of vertebrates: phylogenetics and chromosomal synteny</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1273-1280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>GATA</i> genes are an evolutionarily conserved family, which encode a group of important transcription factors involved in the regulation of diverse processes including the development of the heart, haematopoietic system and sex gonads. However, the evolutionary history of the <i>GATA</i> family has not been completely understood. We constructed a complete phylogenetic tree with functional domain information of the <i>GATA</i> genes of both vertebrates and several invertebrates, and mapped the <i>GATA</i> genes onto relevant chromosomes. Conserved synteny was observed around the <i>GATA</i> loci on the chromosomes. <i>GATAs</i> have a tendency to segregate onto different chromosomes during evolution. The phylogenetic tree is consistent with the relevant functions of <i>GATA</i> members. Analysis of the zinc finger domain showed that the domain tends to be duplicated during evolution from invertebrates to vertebrates. We propose that the balance between duplications of zinc finger domains and <i>GATA</i> members should be maintained to exert their physiological roles in each evolutionary stage. Therefore, evolutionary pressure on the <i>GATAs</i> must exist to maintain the balance during evolution from invertebrates to vertebrates. These results reveal the evolutionary characteristics of the <i>GATA</i> family and contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between evolution and biological functions of the gene family, which will help to uncover the <i>GATAs</i>’ biological roles, evolution and their relationship with associated diseases.</p>

				<title>Arachidonic acid is a chemoattractant for <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1281-1289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a natural chemoattractant of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. It is detected by cell surface cAMP receptors. Besides a signalling cascade involving phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling has been shown to have a major role in chemotaxis. Previously, we have shown that arachidonic acid (AA) induces an increase in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration by causing the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores and activating influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Here we report that AA is a chemoattractant for <i>D. discoideum</i> cells differentiated for 8–9 h. Motility towards a glass capillary filled with an AA solution was dose-dependent and qualitatively comparable to cAMP-induced chemotaxis. Ca<sup>2+</sup> played an important role in AA chemotaxis of wild-type Ax2 as ethyleneglycolbis(b-aminoethyl)-N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) added to the extracellular buffer strongly inhibited motility. In the HM1049 mutant whose <i>iplA</i> gene encoding a putative Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-receptor had been knocked out, chemotaxis was only slightly affected by EGTA. Chemotaxis in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was similar in both strains. Unlike cAMP, addition of AA to a cell suspension did not change cAMP or cGMP levels. A model for AA chemotaxis based on the findings in this and previous work is presented.</p>

				<title>Expression of conserved signalling pathway genes during spontaneous vascular differentiation of R1 embryonic stem cells and in Py-4-1 endothelial cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1291-1298</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are an invaluable model for identifying subtle phenotypes as well as severe outcomes of perturbing gene function that may otherwise result in lethality. However, though ES cells of different origins are regarded as equally pluripotent, their <i>in vitro</i> differentiation potential varies, suggesting that their response to developmental signals is different. The R1 cell line is widely used for gene manipulation due to its good growth characteristics and highly efficient germline transmission. Hence, we analysed the expression of Notch, Wnt and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway genes during differentiation of R1 cells into early vascular lineages. Notch-, Wnt-and Shh-mediated signalling is important during embryonic development. Regulation of gene expression through these signalling molecules is a frequently used theme, resulting in context-dependent outcomes during development. Perturbing these pathways can result in severe and possibly lethal developmental phenotypes often due to primary cardiovascular defects. We report that during early spontaneous differentiation of R1 cells, Notch-1 and the Wnt target Brachyury are active whereas the Shh receptor is not detected. This expression pattern is similar to that seen in a mouse endothelial cell line. This temporal study of expression of genes representative of all three pathways in ES cell differentiation will aid in further analysis of cell signalling during vascular development.</p>

					<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are spontaneously cytotoxic against tumour target cells. Their number was found to be four times more in the spleen of tumour-bearing Swiss albino mice. After activation with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2), NK cells were tested and found to seek out the tumour site when injected intravenously in tumour-bearing mice. Their potential for fighting tumours <i>in vivo</i> was further seen following adoptive transfer of rIL-2 activated NK (A-NK) cells in tumour-bearing mice. After surgical removal of tumour load, adoptive transfer of A-NK cells inhibited tumour recurrence in 92.3% cases, thereby suggesting the use of this protocol for therapeutic purposes to obtain a better outcome.</p>

				<title>Docking mode of delvardine and its analogues into the p66 domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase: screening using molecular mechanics-generalized born/surface area and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1307-1316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Delvardine and its structural derivatives are important non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). In this work, 15 delvardine analogues were studied. A free energy-of-binding (FEB) expression was developed in the form of an optimized linear combination of van der Waal (vdW), electrostatic, solvation and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) energy terms. The solvation energy terms estimated by generalized born/surface area (GB/SA) play an important role in predicting the binding affinity of delvardine analogues. Out of 15 derivatives, substitution of CH<sub>3</sub> with H at the Y and R positions, as well as substitution of SO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> with only CH<sub>2</sub> at the Z position in S2, S8 and S12 analogues, were found to be the most potent (glide score = –7.60, –8.06 and –7.44; pIC50 = 7.28, 7.37 and 7.64) in comparison with the template delvardine (which is used currently as the drug candidate). All the three analogues also passed the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) screening and Lipinski’s rule of 5, and have the potential to be used for second-generation drug development. The work demonstrates that dock molecular mechanics-generalized born/surface area (MM–GB/SA–ADME) is a promising approach to predict the binding activity of ligands to the receptor and further screen for a successful candidate drug in a computer-aided rational drug design.</p>

				<title>A theoretical treatment of interval mapping of a disease gene using transmission disequilibrium tests</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1317-1324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The genetic basis of the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) for two-marker loci is explored from first principles. In this case, parents doubly heterozygous for a given haplotype at the pair of marker loci that are each in linkage disequilibrium with the disease gene with the further possibility of a second-order linkage disequilibrium are considered. The number of times such parents transmit the given haplotype to their affected offspring is counted and compared with the frequencies of haplotypes that are not transmitted. This is done separately for the coupling and repulsion phases of doubly heterozygous genotypes. Expectations of the counts for each of the sixteen cells possible with four-marker gametic types (transmitted vs not transmitted) are derived. Based on a test of symmetry in a square 4 &#215; 4 contingency table, chi-square tests are proposed for the null hypothesis of no linkage between the markers and the disease gene. The power of the tests is discussed in terms of the corresponding non-centrality parameters for the alternative hypothesis that both the markers are linked with the disease locus. The results indicate that the power increases with the decrease in recombination probability and that it is higher for a lower frequency of the disease gene. Taking a pair of markers in an interval for exploring the linkage with the disease gene seems to be more informative than the single-marker case since the values of the non-centrality parameters tend to be consistently higher than their counterparts in the single-marker case. Limitations of the proposed test are also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The formation of diverse cell types from an invariant set of genes is governed by biochemical and molecular processes that regulate gene activity. A complete understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression is the major function of genomics. Computational genomics is a rapidly emerging area for deciphering the regulation of metazoan genes as well as interpreting the results of high-throughput screening. The integration of computer science with biology has expedited molecular modelling and processing of large-scale data inputs such as microarrays, analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes. Many bioinformaticians have developed various algorithms for predicting transcriptional regulatory mechanisms from the sequence, gene expression and interaction data. This review contains compiled information of various computational methods adopted to dissect gene expression pathways.</p>

				<title>Age-dependent increase in green autofluorescence of blood erythrocytes</title>
				<feature>Erratum</feature>
				<page>1345-1345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Green auto-fluorescence (GAF) of different age groups of mouse blood erythrocytes was determined by using a double <i>in vivo</i> biotinylation (DIB) technique that enables delineation of circulating erythrocytes of different age groups. A significant increase in GAF was seen for erythrocytes of old age group (age in circulation &#62; 40 days) as compared to young erythrocytes (age &#60; 15 days). Erythrocytes are removed from blood circulation by macrophages in the reticulo-endothelial system and depletion of macrophages results in an increased proportion of aged erythrocytes in the blood. When mice were depleted of macrophages for 7 days by administration of clodronate loaded liposomes, the overall GAF of erythrocytes increased significantly and this increase could be ascribed to an increase in GAF of the oldest population of erythrocytes. Using the DIB technique, the GAF of a cohort of blood erythrocyte generated during a 5 day window was tracked <i>in vivo</i>. GAF of the defined cohort of erythrocytes remained low till 40 days of age in circulation and then increased steeply till the end of the life span of erythrocytes. Taken together our results provide evidence for an age dependent increase in the GAF of blood erythrocytes that is accentuated by depletion of macrophages. Kinetics of changes in GAF of circulating erythrocytes with age has also been defined.</p>

				<title>A gene-trap strategy identifies quiescence-induced genes in synchronized myoblasts</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0027-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cellular quiescence is characterized not only by reduced mitotic and metabolic activity but also by altered gene expression. Growing evidence suggests that quiescence is not merely a basal state but is regulated by active mechanisms. To understand the molecular programme that governs reversible cell cycle exit, we focused on quiescence-related gene expression in a culture model of myogenic cell arrest and activation. Here we report the identification of quiescence-induced genes using a gene-trap strategy. Using a retroviral vector, we generated a library of gene traps in C2C12 myoblasts that were screened for arrest-induced insertions by live cell sorting (FACS-gal). Several independent genetrap lines revealed arrest-dependent induction of 𝛽gal activity, confirming the efficacy of the FACS screen. The locus of integration was identified in 15 lines. In three lines, insertion occurred in genes previously implicated in the control of quiescence, i.e. EMSY – a BRCA2-interacting protein, p8/com1– a p300HAT-binding protein and MLL5 – a SET domain protein. Our results demonstrate that expression of chromatin modulatory genes is induced in G0, providing support to the notion that this reversibly arrested state is actively regulated.</p>

				<title>Changes in the level of cytosolic calcium, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase activity during platelet aggregation: an in vitro study in platelets from normal subjects and those with cirrhosis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0045-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variceal bleeding due to abnormal platelet function is a well-known complication of cirrhosis. Nitric oxide-related stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis. In the present investigation, we evaluated the level of platelet aggregation and concomitant changes in the level of platelet cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), nitric oxide (NO) and NO synthase (NOS) activity in liver cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the production of NO by NOS and level of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influence the aggregation of platelets in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Agonist-induced aggregation and the simultaneous changes in the level of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, NO and NOS were monitored in platelets of patients with cirrhosis. Platelet aggregation was also measured in the presence of the eNOS inhibitor, diphenylene iodinium chloride (DIC). The level of agonist-induced platelet aggregation was significantly low in the platelets of patients with cirrhosis compared with that in platelets from normal subjects. During the course of platelet aggregation, concomitant elevation in the level of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed in normal samples, whereas the elevation was not significant in platelets of patients with cirrhosis. A parallel increase was observed in the levels of NO and NOS activity. In the presence of the eNOS inhibitor, platelet aggregation was enhanced and accompanied by an elevated calcium level. The inhibition of platelet aggregation in liver cirrhosis might be partly due to greater NO formation by eNOS. Defective Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the internal stores to the cytosol may account for inhibition of aggregation of platelets in cirrhosis. The NO-related defective aggregation of platelets in patients with cirrhosis found in our study is of clinical importance, and the underlying mechanism of such changes suggests a possible therapeutic strategy with cell-specific NO blockers.</p>

				<title>Apoptosis induced by (di-isopropyloxyphoryl-Trp)<sub>2</sub>-Lys-OCH<sub>3</sub> in K562 and HeLa cells</title>

				<page>0055-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>According to the method used in our laboratory, our group synthesized (DIPP-Trp)<sub>2</sub>-Lys-OCH<sub>3</sub>. It inhibited the proliferation of K562 and HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 15.12 and 42.23 𝜇M, respectively. (DIPP-Trp)<sub>2</sub>-Lys-OCH<sub>3</sub> induced a dose-dependent increase of the G2/M cell population in K562 cells, and S cell population in HeLa cells; the sub-G0 population increased dramatically in both cell lines as seen by PI staining experiments using a FACS Calibur Flow cytometer (BeckmanCoulter, USA). Phosphatidylserine could significantly translocate to the surface of the membrane in (DIPP-Trp)<sub>2</sub>-Lys-OCH<sub>3</sub>-treated K562 and HeLa cells. The increase of an early apoptotic population was observed in a dose-dependent manner by both annexin-FITC and PI staining. It was concluded that (DIPP-Trp)<sub>2</sub>-Lys-OCH<sub>3</sub> not only induced cells to enter into apoptosis, but also affected the progress of the cell cycle. It may have arrested the K562 and HeLa cells in the G<sub>2</sub>/M, S phases, respectively. The apoptotic pathway was pulsed at this point, resulting in the treated cells entering into programmed cell death. (DIPP-Trp)<sub>2</sub>-Lys-OCH<sub>3</sub> is a potential anticancer drug that intervenes in the signalling pathway.</p>

				<title>Effect of tetrahydrocurcumin on insulin receptor status in type 2 diabetic rats: studies on insulin binding to erythrocytes </title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0063-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Curcumin is the most active component of turmeric. It is believed that curcumin is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) is one of the major metabolites of curcumin, and exhibits many of the same physiological and pharmacological activities as curcumin and, in some systems, may exert greater antioxidant activity than curcumin. Using circulating erythrocytes as the cellular mode, the insulin-binding effect of THC and curcumin was investigated. Streptozotocin (STZ)–nicotinamide-induced male Wistar rats were used as the experimental models. THC (80 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally for 45 days. The effect of THC on blood glucose, plasma insulin and insulin binding to its receptor on the cell membrane of erythrocytes were studied. Mean specific binding of insulin was significantly lowered in diabetic rats with a decrease in plasma insulin. This was due to a significant decrease in mean insulin receptors. Erythrocytes from diabetic rats showed a decreased ability for insulin–receptor binding when compared with THC-treated diabetic rats. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the decrease in insulin binding was accounted for by a decrease in insulin receptor sites per cell, with erythrocytes of diabetic rats having less insulin receptor sites per cell than THC-treated rats. High affinity (Kd1), low affinity (Kd2) and kinetic analyses revealed an increase in the average receptor affinity of erythrocytes from THC-treated rats compared with those of diabetic rats. These results suggest that acute alteration of the insulin receptor on the membranes of erythrocytes occurred in diabetic rats. Treatment with THC significantly improved specific insulin binding to the receptors, with receptor numbers and affinity binding reaching near-normal levels. Our study suggests the mechanism by which THC increases the number of total cellular insulin binding sites resulting in a significant increase in plasma insulin. The effect of THC is more prominent than that of curcumin.</p>

				<title>Human papillomavirus genotyping by multiplex pyrosequencing in cervical cancer patients from India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0073-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in India. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the causative agent of cervical cancer; and infection with the high-risk genotypes, predominantly HPV16 and 18, is the biggest risk factor. Vaccines targeting HPV16 and 18 have been found to confer protection in large-scale clinical trials. HPV genotyping has traditionally been carried out to screen the population “at risk” using indirect methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus primers combined with various DNA hybridization techniques, and often followed by the sequencing of candidate products. Recently, a high-throughput and direct method based on DNA sequencing has been described for HPV genotyping using multiplex pyrosequencing. We present a pilot study on HPV genotyping of cervical cancer and non-malignant cervical samples using multiplex pyrosequencing. Using genomic DNA from cell lines, cervical biopsies, surgical tissues or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, we could successfully resolve 6 different HPV types out of the 7 tested, with their prevalence found to be in agreement with earlier reports. We also resolved coinfections with two different HPV types in several samples. An HPV16 genotype with a specific and recurrent sequence variation was observed in 8 cancer samples and one non-malignant sample. We find this technique eminently suited for high-throughput applications, which can be easily extended to large sample cohorts to determine a robust benchmark for HPV genotypes prevalent in India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Soft rot is a serious disease in ginger (<i>Zingiber officinale</i> Roscoe), imposing a considerable economic loss annually in all ginger-producing countries. In this study, mRNA differential display was employed to identify genes whose expression was altered in a soft rot-resistant accession of <i>Zingiber zerumbet</i> (L.) Smith, a wild relative of ginger, in response to <i>Pythium aphanidermatum</i> (Edson) Fitzp., which is the principal causative agent of soft-rot disease in ginger. Analysis using 68 primer combinations identified 70 differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), of which 34 TDFs were selected for further analysis following reverse northern screening. Cloning and sequence characterization of the 34 TDFs yielded a total of 54 distinct clones. Functional categorization of these clones revealed seven categories, of which the defence/stress/signalling group was the largest, with clones homologous to genes known to be actively involved in various pathogenesis-related functions in other plant species. The significance of these genes in relation to the resistance response in <i>Z. zerumbet</i> is discussed. This study has provided a pool of candidate genes for detailed molecular dissection of the defence mechanisms in <i>Z. zerumbet</i> and for accessing wild genetic resources for the transgenic improvement of ginger.</p>

					<p>A full-length cDNA encoding ribosome-inactivating/antiviral protein (RIP/AVP) from the leaves of <i>Bougainvillea xbuttiana</i> was isolated. The cDNA consisted of 1364 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) of 960 nucleotides encoding a 35.49 kDa protein of 319 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence has a putative active domain conserved in RIPs/AVPs and shows a varying phylogenetic relationship to the RIPs from other plant species. The deduced protein has been designated BBAP1 (<i>Bougainvillea xbuttiana</i> antiviral protein1). The ORF was cloned into an expression vector and expressed in <i>E. coli</i> as a fusion protein of &#8764;78 kDa.

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0103-0112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A RING zinc finger ankyrin protein gene, designated <i>AdZFP1</i>, was isolated from drought-tolerant <i>Artemisia desertorum</i> Spreng by mRNA differential display and RACE. Its cDNA was 1723 bp and encoded a putative protein of 445 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 47.9 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 7.49. A typical C3HC4-type RING finger domain was found at the C-terminal region of the AdZFP1 protein, and several groups of ankyrin repeats were found at the N-terminal region. Alignments of amino acid sequence showed that AdZFP1 was 66% identical to the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> putative RING zinc finger ankyrin protein AAN31869. Transcriptional analysis showed that <i>AdZFP1</i> was inducible under drought stress in root, stem and leaf of the plant. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the transcript of <i>AdZFP1</i> was strongly induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and also by salinity, cold and heat to some extent. Overexpression of the <i>AdZFP1</i> gene in transgenic tobacco enhanced their tolerance to drought stress.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the effect of nutritional alteration on biomass content and azadirachtin production in cell suspensions of the elite neem variety crida-8. Variations in total nitrogen availability in the medium in terms of different ratios of nitrate:ammonium showed that the ratio 4:1 revealed a profound effect, leading to a 1.5-fold increase in the total extracellular azadirachtin production (5.59 mg/l) over the standard MS medium. Reduction in sucrose (15 mg/l) in the medium exhibited a reduction in biomass and absence of azadirachtin, whereas total phosphate reduction raised intracellular azadirachtin production (6.98 mg/l). An altered medium with a nitrate:ammonium ratio of 4:1 coupled with complete elimination of phosphate enhanced biomass by 36% (59.36 g/l).</p>

				<title>Contribution of pitcher fragrance and fluid viscosity to high prey diversity in a <i>Nepenthes</i> carnivorous plant from Borneo</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0121-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mechanisms that improve prey richness in carnivorous plants may involve three crucial phases of trapping: attraction, capture and retention. <i>Nepenthes rafflesiana</i> var. typica is an insectivorous pitcher plant that is widespread in northern Borneo. It exhibits ontogenetic pitcher dimorphism with the upper pitchers trapping more flying prey than the lower pitchers. While this difference in prey composition has been ascribed to differences in attraction, the contribution of capture and retention has been overlooked. This study focused on distinguishing between the prey trapping mechanisms, and assessing their relative contribution to prey diversity. Arthropod richness and diversity of both visitors and prey in the two types of pitchers were analysed to quantify the relative contribution of attraction to prey trapping. Rate of insect visits to the different pitcher parts and the presence or absence of a sweet fragrance was recorded to clarify the origin and mechanism of attraction. The mechanism of retention was studied by insect bioassays and measurements of fluid viscosity. <i>Nepenthes rafflesiana</i> was found to trap a broader prey spectrum than that previously described for any <i>Nepenthes</i> species, with the upper pitchers attracting and trapping a greater quantity and diversity of prey items than the lower pitchers. Capture efficiency was low compared with attraction or retention efficiency. Fragrance of the peristome, or nectar rim, accounted mainly for the observed non-specific, better prey attraction by the upper pitchers, while the retentive properties of the viscous fluid in these upper pitchers arguably explains the species richness of their flying prey. The pitchers of <i>N. rafflesiana</i> are therefore more than simple pitfall traps and the digestive fluid plays an important yet unsuspected role in the ecological success of the species.</p>

				<page>0137-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protective immunity against mycobacterial infections such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is mediated by interactions between specific T cells and activated macrophages. To date, many aspects of mycobacterial immunity have shown that innate cells are the key elements that substantially influence the subsequent adaptive host response. During the early phases of infection, phagocytic cells and innate lymphocyte subsets play a pivotal role. Here we summarize the findings of recent investigations on macrophages, dendritic cells and 𝛾𝛿 T lymphocytes in the response to mycobacteria.</p>

				<title>A songbird forebrain area potentially involved in auditory discrimination and memory formation</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0145-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Songbirds rely on auditory processing of natural communication signals for a number of social behaviors, including mate selection, individual recognition and the rare behavior of vocal learning – the ability to learn vocalizations through imitation of an adult model, rather than by instinct. Like mammals, songbirds possess a set of interconnected ascending and descending auditory brain pathways that process acoustic information and that are presumably involved in the perceptual processing of vocal communication signals. Most auditory areas studied to date are located in the caudomedial forebrain of the songbird and include the thalamo-recipient field L (subfields L1, L2 and L3), the caudomedial and caudolateral mesopallium (CMM and CLM, respectively) and the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). This review focuses on NCM, an auditory area previously proposed to be analogous to parts of the primary auditory cortex in mammals. Stimulation of songbirds with auditory stimuli drives vigorous electrophysiological responses and the expression of several activity-regulated genes in NCM. Interestingly, NCM neurons are tuned to species-specific songs and undergo some forms of experience-dependent plasticity <i>in-vivo</i>. These activity-dependent changes may underlie long-term modifications in the functional performance of NCM and constitute a potential neural substrate for auditory discrimination. We end this review by discussing evidence that suggests that NCM may be a site of auditory memory formation and/or storage.</p>

					<p>The nineteenth-century British botanist, Joseph Dalton Hooker, was one of the people whose career became a model for that of the modern, professional scientist.

				<title>Generation of tobacco lines with widely different reduction in nicotine levels via RNA silencing approaches</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0177-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Issues related to the nicotine content of tobacco have been public concerns. Several reports have described decreasing nicotine levels by silencing the <i>putrescine N-methyltransferase</i> (<i>PMT</i>) genes, but the reported variations of nicotine levels among transgenic lines are relatively low in general. Here we describe the generation in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) lines with widely different, reduced nicotine levels using three kinds of RNA-silencing approaches. The relative efficacies of suppression were compared among the three approaches regarding the aspect of nicotine level in tobacco leaves. By suppressing expression of the <i>PMT</i> genes, over 200 transgenic lines were obtained with nicotine levels reduced by 9.1–96.7%. RNA interference (RNAi) was the most efficient method of reducing the levels of nicotine, whereas cosuppression and antisense methods were less effective. This report gives clues to the efficient generation of plants with a variety of metabolite levels, and the results demonstrate the relative efficiencies of various RNA-silencing methods.</p>

				<title>Identification of a root-specific glycosyltransferase from <i>Arabidopsis</i> and characterization of its promoter</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0185-0193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A set of Ds-element enhancer trap lines of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was generated and screened for expression patterns leading to the identification of a line that showed root-specific expression of the bacterial <i>uidA</i> reporter gene encoding 𝛽-glucuronidase (GUS). The insertion of the Ds element was found to be immediately downstream to a glycosyltransferase gene At1g73160. Analysis of At1g73160 expression showed that it is highly root-specific. Isolation and characterization of the upstream region of the At1g73160 gene led to the definition of a 218 bp fragment that is sufficient to confer root-specific expression. Sequence analysis revealed that several regulatory elements were implicated in expression in root tissue. The promoter identified and characterized in this study has the potential to be applied in crop biotechnology for directing the root-specific expression of transgenes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Human seminal proteinase and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were each isolated from human seminal fluid and compared. Both are glycoproteins of 32–34 kDa with protease activities. Based on some physicochemical, enzymatic and immunological properties, it is concluded that these proteins are in fact identical. The protein exhibits properties similar to kallikrein-like serine protease, trypsin, chymotrypsin and thiol acid protease. Tests of the activity of the enzyme against some potential natural and synthetic substrates showed that bovine serum albumin was more readily hydrolysed than casein. The results of this study should be useful in purifying and assaying this protein. Based on published studies and the present results, the broad proteolytic specificity of human seminal proteinase suggests a role for this protein in several physiological functions.</p>

				<title>Changes in gene expression following androgen receptor blockade is not equivalent to androgen ablation by castration in the rat ventral prostate</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0209-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Involution of the rat ventral prostate and concomitant modulation of gene expression post-castration is a well-documented phenomenon. While the rat castration model has been extensively used to study androgen regulation of gene expression in the ventral prostate, it is not clear whether all the gene expression changes post-castration are due to androgen depletion alone. To obtain insights into this, we performed differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (DD-RT-PCR) which resulted in the identification of castration and/or flutamide-regulated genes in the rat ventral prostate. These include clusterin, methionine adenosyl transferase II𝛼, and prostate-specific transcripts such as PBPC1BS, S100RVP and A7. While clusterin, PBPC1BS and methionine adenosyl transferase II𝛼 are regulated by both castration and flutamide, S100 RVP and A7 are regulated by castration alone. Interestingly, we show that flutamide, unlike castration, does not induce apoptosis in the rat ventral prostate epithelium, which could be an underlying cause for the differential effects of castration and flutamide treatment. We propose that castration leads to enrichment and depletion of stromal and epithelial cell types, respectively, resulting in erroneous conclusions on some of the cell type-specific transcripts as being androgen regulated.</p>

				<title>Functional characterization of the phospholipase C activity of Rv3487c and its localization on the cell wall of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0221-0230</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> survives and persists for prolonged periods within its host in an asymptomatic, latent state and can reactivate years later if the host’s immune system weakens. The dormant bacilli synthesize and accumulate triacylglycerol, reputed to be an energy source during latency. Among the phospholipases, phospholipase C plays an important role in the pathogenesis. Mutations in a known phospholipase C, <i>plcC</i>, of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> attenuate its growth during the late phase of infection in mice. Hydrolysis of phospholipids by phospholipase C generates diacylglycerol, a well-known signalling molecule that participates in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) through protein kinase C leading to macrophage activation. In the present study, we show that <i>M. tuberculosis</i> possesses an additional cell wall-associated protein, Rv3487c, with phospholipase C activity. The recombinant Rv3487c hydrolyses the substrate phosphatidylcholine and generates diacylglycerol by removing the phosphocholine. Furthermore, Rv3487c is expressed during infection as it exhibits significant humoral immunoreactivity with sera from children with tuberculosis, but not with that from adult patients.</p>

				<title>Photodynamic effect of light-emitting diode light on cell growth inhibition induced by methylene blue</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0231-0237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this study was to propose the use of red light-emitting diode (LED) as an alternative light source for methylene blue (MB) photosensitizing effect in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Its effectiveness was tested against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (ATCC 26923), <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ATCC 26922), <i>Candida albicans</i> (ATCC 90028) and <i>Artemia salina</i>. The maximum absorption of the LED lamps was at a wavelength of 663 nm, at intensities of 2, 4, 6 and 12 J.cm<sup>–2</sup> for 10, 20, 30 and 60 min of exposure, respectively. Assays with and without LED exposure were carried out in plates containing MB at concentrations of 7 to 140.8 𝜇M for microorganisms and 13.35 to 668.5 𝜇M for microorganisms or microcrustaceans. The LED exposure induced more than 93.05%, 93.7% and 93.33% of growth inhibition for concentrations of 42.2 𝜇M for <i>S. aureus</i> (D-value=12.05 min) and 35.2 𝜇M for <i>E. coli</i> (D-value=11.51 min) and <i>C. albicans</i> (D-value=12.18 min), respectively after 20 min of exposure. LED exposure for 1 h increased the cytotoxic effect of MB against <i>A. salina</i> from 27% to 75%. Red LED is a promising light device for PDT that can effectively inhibit bacteria, yeast and microcrustacean growth.</p>

				<page>0239-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present investigation was carried out to know the seasonal variation in plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon cells during the reproductive cycle of untreated <i>Melanochelys trijuga</i>. Pancreatic endocrine cells were immunochemically localized. Insulin-immunoreactive (IR) cells occurred in groups of 3–20 and were in close apposition, while glucagon-IR cells were distributed individually between the exocrine pancreas or formed anastomosing cords where cells were not intimately attached. Whenever both IR cell types were present together forming an islet, insulin-IR cells formed clusters in the centre with glucagon-IR cells being scattered at the periphery. Glucagon-IR cells seemed to be secretory throughout the pancreas during the reproductive cycle, while insulin-IR cells were found to be pulsating in their secretion. Mean size of the islet was 1.306, 0.184 and 2.558 mm in the regenerative, reproductive and regressive periods, respectively. In general, insulin-IR cells measured 5.18 𝜇m and glucagon-IR cells 5.22 𝜇m in their longest axis. Invariably, glucagon-IR cells were more in number than insulin-IR cells. The fasting plasma glucose level was 69.97 mg% during the regenerative period, which increased to 97.96 mg% during the reproductive period, and reached a peak value of 113.52 mg% in the regressive period.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coat protein (CP)-mediated resistance against an Indian isolate of the <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) subgroup IB was demonstrated in transgenic lines of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> through <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated transformation. Out of the fourteen independently transformed lines developed, two lines were tested for resistance against CMV by challenge inoculations. The transgenic lines exhibiting complete resistance remained symptomless throughout life and showed reduced or no virus accumulation in their systemic leaves after virus challenge. These lines also showed virus resistance against two closely related strains of CMV. This is the first report of CP-mediated transgenic resistance against a CMV subgroup IB member isolated from India.</p>

				<title>Development and evaluation of an <i>in vivo</i> assay in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> for screening of compounds for their effect on cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> expression</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0269-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most drugs and xenobiotics induce the expression of cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> (CYP) enzymes, which reduce the bioavailability of the inducer and/or co-administered drugs. Therefore, evaluation of new drug candidates for their effect on CYP expression is an essential step in drug development. The available methods for this purpose are expensive and not amenable to high-throughput screening. We developed a fluorescence-based <i>in vivo</i> assay using transgenic <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> worms that express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of various CYP promoters. Using this assay, we found striking similarities between the worm CYPs and their human orthologs in their response to treatment with various drugs. For example, the antibiotic rifampicin, one of the strongest inducers of the human gene CYP3A4, was the strongest inducer of the worm ortholog CYP13A7. Since worms can be easily grown in liquid medium in microtitre plates, the assay described in this paper is suitable for the screening of a large number of potential lead compounds in the drug discovery process.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A novel nafion–riboflavin membrane was constructed and characterized by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetric techniques. The estimated average diameter of the designed nanoparticles was about 60 nm. The functional membrane showed a quasi-reversible electrochemical behaviour with a formal potential of –562 &#177; 5 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) on the gold electrode. Some electrochemical parameters were estimated, indicating that the system has good and stable electron transfer properties. Moreover, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was immobilized on the riboflavin–nafion functional membrane. The electrochemical behaviour of HRP was quasi-reversible with a formal potential of 80 &#177; 5 mV (vs Ag/AgCl). The HRP in the film exhibited good catalytic activity towards the reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It shows a linear dependence of its cathodic peak current on the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ranging from 10 to 300 𝜇M.</p>

				<title>Measuring collective behaviour of multicellular ensembles: role of space–time scales</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0289-0301</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Living systems are spectacular examples of spatiotemporally organized structures. During the development of complex organization there is dynamic equilibrium between the local and global processes acting at the intra- and intercellular levels in multiple space and time scales. Although in modelling studies such spatiotemporal systems can be described by different space–time scales and at many organizational levels, the experimental quantities measured and predictions useful for practical applications are at a macroscopic (coarser or averaged) level/scale; these are limited by the resolution of the measuring method and experimental protocol. In this work, we address whether the spatiotemporal collective dynamics exhibited by a multiscale system can discriminate between, or be borne out by, the coarse-grained and averaged measurements done at different spatial and temporal scales. Using a simple model of a ring of cells, we show that measurements of both spatial and spatiotemporal average behaviour in this multicellular ensemble can mask the variety of collective dynamics observed at other space–time scales, and exhibit completely different behaviours. Such outcomes of measurements can lead to incomplete and incorrect understanding of physiological functions and pathogenesis in multicell ensembles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sporozoites were detected in naturally infected sibling species of the primary rural vector <i>Anopheles culicifacies</i> complex in two primary health centres (PHCs) and a variant of the urban vector <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> in Mangalore city, Karnataka, south India while carrying out malaria outbreak investigations from 1998–2006. Sibling species of <i>An. culicifacies</i> were identified based on the banding patterns on ovarian polytene chromosomes, and variants of <i>An. stephensi</i> were identified based on the number of ridges on the egg floats. Sporozoites were detected in the salivary glands by the dissection method. Of the total 334 salivary glands of <i>An. culicifacies</i> dissected, 17 (5.08%) were found to be positive for sporozoites. Of the 17 positive samples, 11 were suitable for sibling species analysis; 10 were species A (an efficient vector) and 1 was species B (a poor vector). Out of 46 <i>An. stephensi</i> dissected, one was sporozoite positive and belonged to the type form (an efficient vector). In malaria epidemiology this observation is useful for planning an effective vector control programme, because each sibling species/variant differs in host specificity, susceptibility to malarial parasites, breeding habitats and response to insecticides.</p>

					<p>The assessment of activity of promoters has been greatly facilitated by the use of reporter genes. However, the activity as assessed by reporter gene is a reflection of not only promoter strength, but also that of the stability of the mRNA and the protein encoded by the reporter gene. While a stable reporter gene product is an advantage in analysing activities of weak promoters, it becomes a major limitation for understanding temporal expression patterns of a promoter, as the reporter product persists even after the activity of the promoter ceases. In the present study we undertook a comparative analysis of two reporter genes, 𝛽-<i>glucuronidase</i> (<i>gus</i>) and <i>green fluorescent protein</i> (<i>sgfp</i>), for studying the temporal expression pattern of tapetum-specific promoters A9 (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and TA29 (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). The activity of A9 and TA29 promoters as assessed by transcript profiles of the reporter genes (<i>gus</i> or <i>sgfp</i>) remained the same irrespective of the reporter gene used. However, while the deduced promoter activity using <i>gus</i> was extended temporally beyond the actual activity of the promoter, <i>sgfp</i> as recorded through its fluorescence correlated better with the transcription profile. Our results thus demonstrate that <i>sgfp</i> is a better reporter gene compared to <i>gus</i> for assessment of temporal activity of promoters. Although several earlier reports have commented on the possible errors in deducing temporal activities of promoters using GUS as a reporter protein, we experimentally demonstrate the advantage of using reporter genes such as <i>gfp</i> for analysis of temporal expression patterns.</p>

				<title>Differential dynamics of splicing factor SC35 during the cell cycle</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0345-0354</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pre-mRNA splicing factors are enriched in nuclear domains termed interchromatin granule clusters or nuclear speckles. During mitosis, nuclear speckles are disassembled by metaphase and reassembled in telophase in structures termed mitotic interchromatin granules (MIGs). We analysed the dynamics of the splicing factor SC35 in interphase and mitotic cells. In HeLa cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SC35, this was localized in speckles during interphase and dispersed in metaphase. In telophase, GFP-SC35 was highly enriched within telophase nuclei and also detected in MIGs. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that the mobility of GFP-SC35 was distinct in different mitotic compartments. Interestingly, the mobility of GFP-SC35 was 3-fold higher in the cytoplasm of metaphase cells compared with interphase speckles, the nucleoplasm or MIGs. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) caused changes in the organization of nuclear compartments such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli, with corresponding changes in the mobility of GFP-SC35 and GFP-fibrillarin. Our results suggest that the dynamics of SC35 are significantly influenced by the organization of the compartment in which it is localized during the cell cycle.</p>

				<title>Purification and molecular cloning of a new galactose-specific lectin from <i>Bauhinia variegata</i> seeds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0355-0363</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new galactose-specific lectin was purified from seeds of a Caesalpinoideae plant, <i>Bauhinia variegata</i>, by affinity chromatography on lactose–agarose. Protein extracts haemagglutinated rabbit and human erythrocytes (native and treated with proteolytic enzymes), showing preference for rabbit blood treated with papain and trypsin. Among various carbohydrates tested, the lectin was best inhibited by D-galactose and its derivatives, especially lactose. SDS-PAGE showed that the lectin, named BVL, has a pattern similar to other lectins isolated from the same genus, <i>Bauhinia purpurea</i> agglutinin (BPA). The molecular mass of BVL subunit is 32 871 Da, determined by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. DNA extracted from <i>B. variegata</i> young leaves and primers designed according to the <i>B. purpurea</i> lectin were used to generate specific fragments which were cloned and sequenced, revealing two distinct isoforms. The <i>bvl</i> gene sequence comprised an open reading frame of 876 base pairs which encodes a protein of 291 amino acids. The protein carried a putative signal peptide. The mature protein was predicted to have 263 amino acid residues and 28 963 Da in size.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated the polymorphisms of bovine cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcripts (<i>CART</i>). The coding and regulating regions of <i>CART</i> were screened in 7 cattle breeds by the single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. The four loci (C1, C2, C3 and C4) studied were all polymorphic. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products representing different SSCP variants were sequenced and a total of 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. The associations between polymorphic loci and the growth traits of Nanyang cattle were analysed. The results indicated that genotype A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub> of the C1 locus was associated with a higher body weight (𝑃  &#60; 0.05) than heterozygous A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>. Genotype A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub> of the C2 locus was associated with lower body weight and average daily weight gain (𝑃 &#8804; 0.001) than heterozygous A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>. C3 and C4 loci had no significant effect on Nanyang cattle growth traits (P &#62; 0.05).</p>

				<title>Impact of cytomixis on meiosis, pollen viability and pollen size in wild populations of Himalayan poppy (<i>Meconopsis aculeata</i> Royle)</title>

				<page>0371-0380</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the occurrence of cytomixis in wild populations of Himalayan poppy (<i>Meconopsis aculeata</i> Royle), which is considered to be an important and threatened medicinal plant growing in the high hills of the Himalayas. The impact of cytomixis on meiotic behaviour, reduced pollen viability and heterogeneous-sized pollen grains was also studied. Cytological studies in the seven wild populations from the high hills of Himachal Pradesh revealed that all the Himalayan populations exist uniformly at the tetraploid level (2n=56) on x=14. The phenomenon of chromatin transfer among the proximate pollen mother cells (PMCs) in six populations caused various meiotic abnormalities. Chromatin transfer also resulted in the formation of coenocytes, aneuploid, polyploid and anucleated PMCs. Among individuals that showed chromatin transfer, chromosome stickiness and interbivalent connections were frequently observed in some PMCs. The phenomenon of cytomixis in the species seems to be directly under genetic control; it affects the meiotic course considerably and results in reduced pollen viability.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed a one-dimensional tumour simulator to describe the biodistribution of chemotherapeutic drugs to a tumoral lesion and the tumour cell’s response to therapy. A three-compartment model is used for drug dynamics within the tumour. The first compartment represents the extracellular space in which cells move, the second corresponds to the intracellular fluid space (including cell membrane) which is in direct equilibrium with the extracellular space, and the third is a non-exchangeable compartment that represents sequestered drug which is trapped in the nucleus to damage the cellular DNA, directly triggering cell death. Analytical and numerical techniques (Finite Element Method) are used to describe the tumour’s response to therapy and the effect of parameter variation on the drug concentration profiles in the three compartments.</p>

				<title>Patchiness in a minimal nutrient – phytoplankton model</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0391-0403</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a minimal two-component model that can exhibit various types of spatial patterns including patchiness. The model, comprising nutrients and phytoplankton, includes the effect of nutrient uptake by phytoplankton as a Holling type II functional response, and also includes the effect of zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton as a Holling type II non-dynamical term. The mean-field model without the diffusion and advection terms shows both bistability and limit-cycle oscillations as a few parameters such as the input rate of nutrients and the maximum feeding rate of zooplankton are changed. If the parameter values are chosen from the limit-cycle oscillation region, the corresponding reaction–advection–diffusion equations show spatial pattern formations by the combined effects of advection and diffusion by turbulent stirring and mixing, and biological interactions. As the nutrient input is increased, the system behaviour changes from the extinction of the entire phytoplankton to the formation of filamentous patterns, patchiness patterns and homogeneous distributions. These observations suggest that the spatial pattern of phytoplankton can function as an indicator to evaluate the eutrophication level in aquatic ecosystems.</p>

				<title>Astrocyte, the star <i>avatar</i>: redefined</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0405-0421</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Until recently, the neuroscience community held the belief that glial cells such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes functioned solely as “support” cells of the brain. In this role, glial cells simply provide physical support and housekeeping functions for the more important cells of the brain, the neurons. However, this view has changed radically in recent years with the discovery of previously unrecognized and surprising functions for this underappreciated cell type. In the past decade or so, emerging evidence has provided new insights into novel glial cell activities such as control of synapse formation and function, communication, cerebrovascular tone regulation, immune regulation and adult neurogenesis. Such advances in knowledge have effectively elevated the role of the astrocyte to one that is more important than previously realized. This review summarizes the past and present knowledge of glial cell functions that has evolved over the years, and has resulted in a new appreciation of astrocytes and their value in studying the neurobiology of human brain cells and their functions. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the role of glial cells in physiology, pathophysiology and, most importantly, in adult neurogenesis and “stemness”, with special emphasis on astrocytes.</p>

				<title>Dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever: Indian perspective</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0429-0441</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relationship of this country with dengue has been long and intense. The first recorded epidemic of clinically dengue-like illness occurred at Madras in 1780 and the dengue virus was isolated for the first time almost simultaneously in Japan and Calcutta in 1943–1944. After the first virologically proved epidemic of dengue fever along the East Coast of India in 1963–1964, it spread to allover the country. The first full-blown epidemic of the severe form of the illness, the dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome occurred in North India in 1996. <i>Aedes aegypti</i> is the vector for transmission of the disease. Vaccines or antiviral drugs are not available for dengue viruses; the only effective way to prevent epidemic degure fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) is to control the mosquito vector, <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and prevent its bite. This country has few virus laboratories and some of them have done excellent work in the area of molecular epidemiology, immunopathology and vaccine development. Selected work done in this country on the problems of dengue is presented here.</p>

				<title>Chikungunya: an overview</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0443-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chikungunya (CHIK), a mosquito borne debilitating disease, is caused by CHIK virus, an alphavirus belonging to the family Togaviridae. The sudden onset of very high fever along with rash, and severe arthralgia especially in the small joints of hands and toes are the characteristics of the disease. It was first reported from Tanzania in 1952-53 and spread subsequently to sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Pacific causing large epidemics. The virus exists in three genotypes, the Asian, West African and East Central South African that are responsible for outbreaks in the respective areas. The first outbreak in Asia was in Bangkok in 1958 followed by other Asian countries. India experienced massive outbreaks of CHIK in the 1960s and early 70s mainly in cities. After a gap of 32 years an explosive outbreak of CHIK devastated the country affecting more than 1.4 million people in 13 states. The epidemic also witnessed many unusual clinico-pathological complications including CHIK associated deaths and mother to child transmission. High morbidity with severe arthralgia persisted for several months made the people mentally and physically weak. This review describes CHIK in general and highlights the various clinico-pathological aspects observed during the recent outbreak.</p>

				<title>Molecular biology and pathogenesis of hepatitis E virus</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0451-0464</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small RNA virus and the etiological agent for hepatitis E, a form of acute viral hepatitis. The virus has a feco-oral transmission cycle and is transmitted through environmental contamination, mainly through drinking water. Recent studies on the isolation of HEV-like viruses from animal species also suggest zoonotic transfer of the virus. The absence of small animal models of infection and efficient cell culture systems has precluded virological studies on the replication cycle and pathogenesis of HEV. A vaccine against HEV has undergone successful clinical testing and diagnostic tests are available. This review describes HEV epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, molecular virology and the host response to HEV infection. The focus is on published literature in the past decade.</p>

				<title>Hepatitis C in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0465-0473</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hepatitis C is an emerging infection in India and an important pathogen causing liver disease in India. The high risk of chronicity of this blood-borne infection and its association with hepatocellular carcinoma underscores its public health importance. Blood transfusion and unsafe therapeutic interventions by infected needles are two preventable modalities of spread of hepatitis C infection. In addition, risk factor modification by reducing the number of intravenous drug users will help curtail the prevalence of this infection. This review summarizes the extent, nature and implications of this relatively new pathogen in causing disease in India.</p>

				<title>Emerging influenza virus: A global threat</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0475-0482</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Since 1918, influenza virus has been one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality, especially among young children. Though the commonly circulating strain of the virus is not virulent enough to cause mortality, the ability of the virus genome to mutate at a very high rate may lead to the emergence of a highly virulent strain that may become the cause of the next pandemic. Apart from the influenza virus strain circulating in humans (H1N1 and H3N2), the avian influenza H5N1 H7 and H9 virus strains have also been reported to have caused human infections, H5N1 H7 and H9 have shown their ability to cross the species barrier from birds to humans and further replicate in humans. This review addresses the biological and epidemiological aspects of influenza virus and efforts to have a control on the virus globally.</p>

				<title>Human metapneumovirus: a new respiratory pathogen</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0483-0493</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human metapneumovirus is a recently recognized pathogen of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in children as well as elderly and immunocompromised adults. The virus belongs to the family <i>Paramyxoviridae</i>, sub family <i>Pneumovirinae</i> and genus <i>Metapneumovirus</i>. Through genetic analysis it has been characterized into two groups A and B which are further divided into four sub-lineages. The virus is difficult to grow in tissue culture and hence reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for N and L gene is the method of choice for diagnosis. The virus has been seen in all countries with seasonal distribution in winter months for temperate and spring/summer for tropical countries. F gene is the most conserved among different lineages and efforts are underway to design recombination vaccine using F gene.</p>

				<title>Hantaviruses: an emerging public health threat in India? A review</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0495-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The emerging viral diseases haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) are a cause of global concern as they are increasingly reported from newer regions of the world. The hantavirus species causing HFRS include Hantaan virus, Seoul virus, Puumala virus, and Dobrava-Belgrade virus while Sin Nombre virus was responsible for the 1993 outbreak of HCPS in the Four Corners Region of the US. Humans are accidental hosts and get infected by aerosols generated from contaminated urine, feces and saliva of infected rodents. Rodents are the natural hosts of these viruses and develop persistent infection. Human to human infections are rare and the evolution of the virus depends largely on that of the rodent host. The first hantavirus isolate to be cultured, Thottapalayam virus, is the only indigenous isolate from India, isolated from an insectivore in 1964 in Vellore, South India. Research on hantaviruses in India has been slow but steady since 2005. Serological investigation of patients with pyrexic illness revealed presence of anti-hantavirus IgM antibodies in 14.7% of them. The seropositivity of hantavirus infections in the general population is about 4% and people who live and work in close proximity with rodents have a greater risk of acquiring hantavirus infections. Molecular and serological evidence of hantavirus infections in rodents and man has also been documented in this country. The present review on hantaviruses is to increase awareness of these emerging pathogens and the threats they pose to the public health system.</p>

				<title>Preventive strategies for frequent outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis in Northern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0505-0514</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) remains the most important cause of acute viral encephalitis and continues to spread to hitherto unaffected regions like Indonesia, Pakistan and Australia. Approximately 60% of the world population inhabits JE endemic areas. Despite its restricted range mostly in the developing countries, a high annual incidence of 50,000 cases and about 10,000 deaths has been reported. Disease can be fatal in 25% cases. Magnitude of the problem is even more alarming since the survivors are left with serious long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae. Almost every two years, epidemics of JE occur in Indian subcontinent with a high mortality. JE virus infection results in different disease manifestations in host from mild subclinical febrile illness to clinical infections leading to encephalitis. No antiviral treatment is so far available for JE. The prevention of JE can be achieved by controlling the vector or by immunization regime. The vector control in the rural areas, which are the worst affected ones, is practically almost impossible. Three vaccines that have been implicated against JE include inactivated mouse brain derived, inactivated cell culture derived and cell culture derived live attenuated JE vaccine. But each has its own limitation. Currently, attempts to synthesize recombinant DNA vaccine are being made. New therapeutics are on the way of development like use of minocycline, short interfering RNA, arctigenin, rosmarinic acid, DNAzymes etc. However, the immune mechanisms that lead to JE are complex and need to be elucidated further for the development of therapeutics as well as safe and efficacious JE vaccines.</p>

				<title>HIV infection in India: Epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis.</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0515-0525</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The year 1986 saw first case of HIV infection as well as first report of AIDS case in India. Since then the epidemic has spread throughout the country. In the recent years there is evidence of epidemic being stabilized with decrease in new infections reported from some parts of the country. The absolute number of HIV infections in the country is expected to be close to 2.5 million and National AIDS Control Programme, phase III is geared to contain the epidemic. HIV viruses circulating in India predominantly belong to HIV-1 subtype C. However, there have been occasional reports of HIV-1 subtype A and B. Matter of concern is reports of A/C and B/C mosaic viruses that are being reported from different parts of the country. The data on HIV drug resistance from India is rather limited. Most of the studies have shown that the virus strains from drug naïve patients do not show significant level of drug resistance mutations. The few immunological studies in Indian patients show that the Indian HIV infected patients show both HIV-specific CTL responses as well as neutralizing antibody response. Mapping of CTL epitopes showed that while Indian patients identify same regions of Gag antigen as recognized by South African subtype C infected patients, some regions are uniquely recognized by Indian patients. There are very few studies on host genetic factors in India in context with HIV infection. However there are evidences reported of association of host genetic factors such as HLA types and haplotypes and HIV disease.</p>

				<title>HIV and tuberculosis in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0527-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The global impact of the converging dual epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the major public health challenges of our time. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports 9.2 million new cases of TB in 2006 of whom 7.7% were HIV-infected. Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients as well as the leading cause of death. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDRTB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. The diagnosis of TB is based on sputum smear microscopy, a 100-year old technique and chest radiography, which has problems of specificity. Extra-pulmonary, disseminated and sputum smear negative manifestations are more common in patients with advanced immunosuppression. Newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-poor settings. Treatment of HIV-TB co-infection is complex and associated with high pill burden, overlapping drug toxicities, risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and challenges related to adherence. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for tuberculosis and vice-versa will help identify co-infected patients who require treatment for both infections. This requires good coordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programs, in India.</p>

				<title>Brucellosis in India – a review</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0539-0547</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Brucellosis is an important re-emerging zoonosis with a worldwide distribution. It is still an uncontrolled serious public health problem in many developing countries including India. Brucellosis in India is yet a very common but often neglected disease. Currently, <i>Brucella melitensis</i> accounts for most recorded cases globally with cattle emerging as a important reservoir with the few cases of <i>B. suis</i>. Isolated cases of non-terrestrial brucellosis and continuing transmission from wild animals have raised important epidemiological issues. Routine serological surveillance along with high clinical suspicion and screening of family members of index cases would be essential in delineating the real magnitude of human brucellosis in endemic countries. Increased business and leisure travel to endemic countries have led to diagnostic challenge in non-endemic areas. Laboratory testing is indispensable for diagnosis. Advances in newer rapid, sensitive, and specific testing methodologies and alternate treatment strategies are urgently needed. A safe and effective vaccine in human is not yet available. Prevention is dependent upon increasing public awareness through health education programmes and safe livestock practices. Active co-operation between health and veterinary services should be promoted. This review collates world literature and its impact to the discovery, isolation and diagnosis and epidemiology along with the control measures adapted in the Indian scenario.</p>

				<title>Emerging and re-emerging bacterial diseases in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0549-0555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There has been a remarkable progress in the prevention, control and even eradication of infectious diseases with improved hygiene and development of antimicrobials and vaccines. However, infectious diseases still remain a leading cause of global disease burden with high morbidity and mortality especially in the developing world. Furthermore, there have been threats of new diseases during the past three decades due to the evolution and adaptation of microbes and the re-emergence of old diseases due to the development of antimicrobial resistance and the capacity to spread to new geographic areas. The impact of the emerging and re-emerging diseases in India has been tremendous at socioeconomic and public health levels. Their control requires continuing surveillance, research and training, better diagnostic facilities and improved public health system. Emerging and reemerging zoonotic diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases and diseases caused by multiresistant organisms constitute the major threats in India. This review of bacterial emerging and re-emerging diseases should be of critical importance to microbiologists, clinicians, public health personnel and policy makers in India.</p>

				<title>Leptospirosis: an emerging global public health problem</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0557-0569</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Leptospirosis has been recognized as an emerging global public health problem because of its increasing incidence in both developing and developed countries. A number of leptospirosis outbreaks have occurred in the past few years in various places such as Nicaragua, Brazil and India. Some of these resulted due to natural calamities such as cyclone and floods. It is a direct zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes belonging to different pathogenic species of the genus <i>Leptospira</i>. Large number of animals acts as carriers or vectors. Human infection results from accidental contact with carrier animals or environment contaminated with leptospires. The primary source of leptospires is the excretor animal, from whose renal tubules leptospires are excreted into the environment with the animal urine. Majority of leptospiral infections are either sub clinical or result in very mild illness and recover without any complications. However, a small proportion develops various complications due to involvement of multiple organ systems. In such patients, the clinical presentation depends upon the predominant organs involved and the case fatality ratio could be about 40% or more. Febrile illness with icterus, splenomegaly and nephritis (known as Weil’s disease), acute febrile illness with severe muscle pain, febrile illness with pulmonary haemorrhages in the form of haemoptysis, jaundice with pulmonary haemorrhages, jaundice with heamaturea, meningitis with haemorrhages including sub conjunctival haemorrhage or febrile illness with cardiac arrhythmias with or without haemorrhages are some of the syndromes. Because of the protean manifestations of leptospirosis it is often misdiagnosed and under-reported. Although the basic principles of prevention such as source reduction, environmental sanitation, more hygienic work-related and personal practices etc., are same everywhere, there is no universal control method applicable to all epidemiological settings. Comprehensive understanding of the eco- epidemiological and cultural characteristics of a community that faces the problem of leptospirosis is an essential prerequisite for evolving an effective and acceptable control measure.</p>

				<title>Human cysticercosis and Indian scenario: a review</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0571-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cysticercosis, caused by <i>Taenia solium</i> larva is a major public health problem, especially in the developing world and neurocysticercosis (NCC) is considered to be the most common parasitic infestation of the central nervous system. NCC is identified as the single most common cause of community acquired active epilepsy; 26.3% to 53.8% active epilepsy cases in the developing world including India and Latin America are due to NCC. It is also becoming more common in the developed world because of increased migration of people with the disease or <i>Taenia solium</i> carriers and frequent travel to the endemic countries. It is estimated that three quarters of the estimated 50 million people with active epilepsy live in the poor countries of the world. Recent Indian studies using neuroimaging techniques suggest that the disease burden in India surpasses many other developing countries. Hence it is important to know the epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostic criteria so as to assess the disease burden and adopt interventional strategies for its control. Literature search was done for this review with special emphasis on Indian studies to create awareness about the disease in India, since cysticercosis is preventable and potentially eradicable.</p>

				<title>Malaria in India: Challenges and opportunities</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0583-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India contributes about 70% of malaria in the South East Asian Region of WHO. Although annually India reports about two million cases and 1000 deaths attributable to malaria, there is an increasing trend in the proportion of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> as the agent. There exists heterogeneity and variability in the risk of malaria transmission between and within the states of the country as many ecotypes/paradigms of malaria have been recognized. The pattern of clinical presentation of severe malaria has also changed and while multi-organ failure is more frequently observed in falciparum malaria, there are reports of vivax malaria presenting with severe manifestations. The high burden populations are ethnic tribes living in the forested pockets of the states like Orissa, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and the North Eastern states which contribute bulk of morbidity and mortality due to malaria in the country. Drug resistance, insecticide resistance, lack of knowledge of actual disease burden along with new paradigms of malaria pose a challenge for malaria control in the country. Considering the existing gaps in reported and estimated morbidity and mortality, need for estimation of true burden of malaria has been stressed. Administrative, financial, technical and operational challenges faced by the national programme have been elucidated. Approaches and priorities that may be helpful in tackling serious issues confronting malaria programme have been outlined.</p>

				<title>Emerging antibiotic resistance in bacteria with special reference to India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0593-0603</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The antibiotic era started in the 1940s and changed the profile of infectious diseases and human demography. The burgeoning classes and numbers promised much and elimination of this major cause of human (and animal) morbidity appeared possible. Bacterial antibiotic resistance which was observed soon after antibiotic introduction has been studied extensively. Diverse mechanisms have been demonstrated and the genetic basis elucidated. The resilience of the prokaryote ecosystems to antibiotic stress has been realized. The paper presents these subjects briefly to afford an overview. The epidemiology of antibiotic resistance is dealt with and community practices in different countries are described. The role of high antibiotic usage environments is indicated. The implication of the wide use of antibiotics in animals has been pointed out. Steadily increasing antibiotic resistance and decreasing numbers of newer antibiotics appear to point to a <i>post-antibiotic period</i> during which treatment of infections would become increasingly difficult. This article attempts to review the global antimicrobial resistance scene and juxtaposes it to the Indian experience. The prevalence in India of antibiotic resistance among major groups of pathogens is described. The factors that determine the prevalent high antibiotic resistance rates have been highlighted. The future research activity to ensure continued utility of antibiotics in the control of infections has been indicated.</p>

				<title>Multidrug resistant to extensively drug resistant tuberculosis: What is next?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0605-0616</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Drug resistant tuberculosis is a man made problem. While tuberculosis is hundred percent curable, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is difficult to treat. Inadequate and incomplete treatment and poor treatment adherence has led to a newer form of drug resistance known as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). XDR-TB is defined as tuberculosis caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> strain, which is resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid among the first line anti tubercular drugs (MDR-TB) in addition to resistance to any fluroquinolones and at least one of three injectable second line anti tubercular drugs i.e. amikacin, kanamycin and/or capreomycin. Mismanagement of tuberculosis paves the way to drug resistant tuberculosis. Emergence of XDR-TB is reported world wide. Reported prevalence rates of XDR-TB of total MDR cases are; 6.6% overall worldwide, 6.5% in industrialized countries, 13.6% in Russia and Eastern Europe, 1.5% in Asia, 0.6% in Africa and Middle East and 15.4% in Republic of Korea. Better management and control of tuberculosis specially drug resistant TB by experienced and qualified doctors, access to standard microbiology laboratory, co-morbitidy of HIV and tuberculosis, new anti-TB drug regimens, better diagnostic tests, international standards for second line drugs (SLD)-susceptibility testing, invention of newer anti-tubercular molecules and vaccines and knowing the real magnitude of XDR-TB are some of the important issues to be addressed for effective prevention and management of XDR-TB.</p>

				<title>Rapid and real-time detection technologies for emerging viruses of biomedical importance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0617-0628</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development of technologies with rapid and sensitive detection capabilities and increased throughput have become crucial for responding to greater number threats posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses in the recent past. The conventional identification methods require time-consuming culturing, and/ or detection of antibodies, which are not very sensitive and specific. The recent advances in molecular biology techniques in the field of genomics and proteomics greatly facilitate the rapid identification with more accuracy. We have developed two real-time assays i.e., SYBR green I based real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection as well as typing of some of the emerging viruses of biomedical importance viz. dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, west Nile, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) etc. Both these techniques are capable of detection and differentiation as well as quantifying viral load with higher sensitivity, rapidity, specificity. One of the most important advantages of LAMP is its field applicability, without requirement of any sophisticated equipments. Both these assays have been extensively evaluated and validated with clinical samples of recent epidemics from different parts of India. The establishment of these real time molecular assays will certainly facilitate the rapid detection of viruses with high degree of precision and accuracy in future.</p>

				<title>Three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the bovine <i>LHX3</i> gene</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0673-0679</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The LHX3 gene encodes LIM homeodomain class transcription factors that have important roles to play in pituitary and nervous system development. On the one hand, mutations of <i>LHX3</i> are associated with deficiencies of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), luteotrophic hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); on the other hand, mutations of <i>LHX3</i> are also associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) diseases in human and animal models. To date, few polymorphisms of the bovine <i>LHX3</i> gene have been reported. In this study, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing methods were employed to screen the genetic variations within the bovine <i>LHX3</i> gene in 802 Chinese indigenous cattle. The results revealed three novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): AY923832: g.7553G &#62; A, 7631C &#62; T and 7668C &#62; G. Among them, a synonymous mutation of exon II was identified: GAG (Glu) &#62; GAA (Glu) at position 72 aa (AY923832:g.7553G &#62; A) of LHX3 (403aa) in the four Chinese bovine breeds. Significant statistical differences in genotypic frequencies for exon II and its flanking region of the <i>LHX3</i> gene implied that the polymorphic locus was significantly associated with cattle breeds by the 𝜒<sup>2</sup>-test (𝜒<sup>2</sup> = 68.975, df = 6, P &#60; 0.001). Hence, the three novel SNPs not only extend the spectrum of genetic variations of the bovine <i>LHX3</i> gene, but could also possibly contribute to conducting association analysis and evaluating these as genetic markers in bovine breeding and genetics, and CPHD detection.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0681-0690</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The full-length cDNA encoding a cysteine protease, designated <i>HbCP1</i>, was isolated for the first time from <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i> by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. <i>HbCP1</i> contained a 1371 bp open reading frame encoding 457 amino acids. The deduced HbCP1 protein, which showed high identity to cysteine proteases of other plant species, was predicted to possess a putative repeat in toxin (RTX) domain at the N-terminal and a granulin (GRAN) domain at the C-terminal. Southern blot analysis indicated that the <i>HbCP1</i> gene is present as a single copy in the rubber tree. Transcription pattern analysis revealed that <i>HbCP1</i> had high transcription in laticifer, and low transcription in bark and leaf. The transcription of <i>HbCP1</i> in latex was induced by ethylene and tapping. Cloning of the <i>HbCP1</i> gene will enable us to further understand the molecular characterization of cysteine protease and its possible function in the rubber tree.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0691-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We prepared single-chain immunoglobulin Fv fragments (scFv) SLH10 specific for the HepG2 cell line after biopanning from a large human-naïve phage display library (Griffin. 1 Library). The three-dimensional (3D) structure of SLH10 was modelled by the Insight II molecule simulation software. The structure was refined using the molecular dynamics method. The structures with the least steric clashes and lowest energy were determined finally. The optimized structures of heavy (VH) and light (VL) variable chains of SLH10 scFv were obtained. Then SLH10 bivalent single-chain Fv (BsFv) was constructed that would be suitable for high-affinity targeting. SLH10 BsFv was generated by linking scFvs together and identified by sequencing. Its expression products were confirmed by western blot analysis. The relative molecular masses of scFv and BsFv were approximately 30 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively. Flow cytometry revealed that SLH10 BsFv bound the selected cell lines with greater signal intensity than the parental scFv. The improved antigen binding of SLH10 BsFv may be useful for immunodiagnostics or targeted gene therapy for liver cancer.</p>

				<title>Comparative docking studies of CYP1b1 and its PCG-associated mutant forms</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0699-0713</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular docking has been used to compare and contrast the binding modes of oestradiol with the wild-type and some disease-associated mutant forms of the human CYP1b1 protein. The receptor structures used for docking were derived from molecular dynamics simulations of homology-modelled structures. Earlier studies involving molecular dynamics and principal component analysis indicated that mutations could have a disruptive effect on function, by destabilizing the native properties of the functionally important regions, especially those of the haem-binding and substrate-binding regions, which constitute the site of catalytic activity of the enzyme. In order to gain more insights into the possible differences in substrate-binding and catalysis between the wild-type and mutant proteins, molecular docking studies were carried out. Mutants showed altered protein–ligand interactions compared with the wild-type as a consequence of changes in the geometry of the substrate-binding region and in the position of haem relative to the active site. An important difference in ligand–protein interactions between the wild-type and mutants is the presence of stacking interaction with phenyl residues in the wild-type, which is either completely absent or considerably weaker in mutants. The present study revealed essential differences in the interactions between ligand and protein in wild-type and disease mutants, and helped in understanding the deleterious nature of disease mutations at the level of molecular function.</p>

				<title>Proteomic analysis of cervical cancer cells treated with suberonylanilide hydroxamic acid</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0715-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Suberonylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is an orally administered histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) that has shown significant antitumour activity in a variety of tumour cells. To identify proteins involved in its antitumour activity, we utilized a proteomic approach to reveal protein expression changes in the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa following SAHA treatment. Protein expression profiles were analysed by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and protein identification was performed on a MALDI-Q-TOF MS/MS instrument. As a result, a total of nine differentially expressed proteins were visualized by 2-DE and Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining. Further, all the changed proteins were positively identified via mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis. Of these, PGAM1 was significantly downregulated in HeLa cells after treatment with SAHA. Moreover, PGAM1 has been proven to be downregulated in another cervical cancer cell line (CaSki) by western blot analysis. Together, using proteomic tools, we identified several differentially expressed proteins that underwent SAHA-induced apoptosis. These changed proteins may provide some clues to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SAHA-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer.</p>

				<title>Redifferentiation of human hepatoma cells (SMMC-7721) induced by two new highly oxygenated bisabolane-type sesquiterpenes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0723-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bisabolane-type sesquiterpenes are a class of biologically active compounds that has antitumour, antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant and antivenom properties. We investigated the effect of two new highly oxygenated bisabolane-type sesquiterpenes (HOBS) isolated from <i>Cremanthodium discoideum</i> (<i>C. discoideum</i>) on tumour cells. Our results showed that HOBS induced morphological differentiation and reduced microvilli formation on the cell surface in SMMC-7721 cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that HOBS could induce cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Moreover, HOBS was able to increase tyrosine-𝛼-ketoglutarate transaminase activity, decrease 𝛼-foetoprotein level and 𝛾-glutamyl transferase activity. In addition, we found that HOBS inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, all the above observations indicate that HOBS might be able to normalize malignant SMMC-7721 cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing redifferentiation.</p>

				<title><i>Drosophila</i>-based <i>in vivo</i> assay for the validation of inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor/Ras pathway</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0731-0742</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a common phenomenon observed in most cancers. Clinical treatment of such cancer involves the use of chemotherapeutic agents such as gefitinib and erlotinib which are inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (TK). These small molecules bind to the ATP-binding sites of the TK domain of EGFR. Our <i>in silico</i> analysis suggests that the TK domains of <i>Drosophila</i> and human EGFR are highly conserved. We therefore employed the <i>Drosophila</i> system to validate the <i>in silico</i> observations made with two important anticancer drugs. Since a large number of mutant flies are available, it was possible to investigate the various components of the EGFR/Ras/Raf/ MAPK pathways and the phosphorylation status of diphosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (dp-ERK1/2). These studies confirm the binding of the anilinoquinazolines to the <i>Drosophila</i> EGFR protein and modulation of its activity. Thus, <i>Drosophila</i> appears to be a robust and simple model system for screening newer anticancer drugs that act as TK inhibitors (TKIs).</p>

				<title>Numerical exploration of the influence of neural noise on the psychometric function at low stimulation intensity levels</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0743-0753</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relationship between stimulus intensity and the probability of detecting the presence of the stimulus is described by the psychometrical function. The probabilistic nature of this relationship is based on the stochastic behaviour of sensory neural channels and sensory networks involved in perceptual processing (Kiang 1968). This study tries to establish a continuum of variability across different levels of integration in the central nervous system. Once the opening and closing times of ionic channels was simulated, a threshold to the collective behaviour of voltage-gated ionic channels was imposed in order to generate the spike train of a single neuron. Afterwards, the trains of spikes of different neurons were added up, simulating the activity of a sensory nerve. By adding the activity due to the stimulus to the spontaneous neural behaviour, the psychometric function was simulated using a thresholding approach. The results can replicate the stochastic resonance phenomenon, but also open up the possibility that attentional phenomena can be mediated not only by increasing neural activity (bursting or oscillatory), but also by increasing noise at the neural level.</p>

				<title>Inherent rhythmcity and interstitial cells of Cajal in a frog vein</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0755-0759</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interstitial cells of Cajal are responsible for rhythmic contractions of the musculature of the gastrointestinal tract and blood vessels. The existence of these cells and spontaneous rhythmicity were noticed in amphibian vein and the findings are reported in this paper. The postcaval vein was identified in the frog, <i>Rana tigrina</i> and was perfused with amphibian Ringer solution after isolation. Contractile activity was recorded through a tension transducer connected to a polygraph. The isolated postcaval vein showed spontaneous rhythmic activity. Addition of cold Ringer solution decreased, while warm Ringer increased, the rate of contraction. Adrenaline caused inhibition of rhythmic activity at a dosage that increased the rate of isolated sinus venosus. Sections of the postcaval vein, when stained supravitally with methylene blue, showed the presence of interstitial cells of Cajal. Photic stimulation of the vein in the presence of methylene blue led to a significant decrease in the rate of spontaneous beating of the vein. These findings indicate that the postcaval vein of frog is capable of inherent rhythmcity, which is dependent on the interstitial cells of Cajal but is independent of the sinus venosus.</p>

				<title>Primate numts and reticulate evolution of capped and golden leaf monkeys (Primates: Colobinae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0761-0770</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A recent phylogenetic study of langurs and leaf monkeys of South Asia suggested a reticulate evolution of capped and golden leaf monkeys through ancient hybridization between <i>Semnopithecus</i> and <i>Trachypithecus</i>. To test this hybridization scenario, I analysed nuclear copies of the mitochondrial cytochrome 𝑏 gene (numts) from capped, golden and Phayre’s leaf monkeys. These numts were aligned with mitochondrial cytochrome 𝑏 sequences of various species belonging to the genera <i>Semnopithecus</i> and <i>Trachypithecus</i>. In the phylogenetic tree derived from this alignment, the numts fell into three distinct clades (A, B and C) suggesting three independent integration events. Clade A was basal to <i>Semnopithecus</i>, and clades B and C were basal to <i>Trachypithecus</i>. Among the numts in clades A and C were sequences derived from species not represented in their respective sister mitochondrial groups. This unusual placement of certain numts is taken as additional support for the hybridization scenario. Based on the molecular dating of these integration events, hybridization is estimated to have occurred around 7.1 to 3.4 million years ago. Capped and golden leaf monkeys might have to be assigned to a new genus to reconcile their unique evolutionary history. Additionally, northeast India appears to be a ‘hot spot’ for lineages that might have evolved through reticulate evolution.</p>

				<title>Branch-point stoichiometry can generate weak links in metabolism: the case of glycine biosynthesis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0771-0780</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although the metabolic network permits conversion between almost any pair of metabolites, this versatility fails at certain sites because of chemical constraints (kinetic, thermodynamic and stoichiometric) that seriously restrict particular conversions. We call these sites weak links in metabolism, as they can interfere harmfully with management of matter and energy if the network as a whole does not include adequate safeguards. A critical weak link is created in glycine biosynthesis by the stoichiometry of the reaction catalyzed by glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1), which converts serine into glycine plus one C<sub>1</sub> unit: this produces an absolute dependence of the glycine production flux on the utilization of C<sub>1</sub> units for other metabolic pathways that do not work coordinately with glycine use. It may not be possible, therefore, to ensure that glycine is always synthesized in sufficient quantities to meet optimal metabolic requirements.</p>

				<title>The neural crest and neural crest cells: discovery and significance for theories of embryonic organization</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0781-0793</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The neural crest has long fascinated developmental biologists, and, increasingly over the past decades, evolutionary and evolutionary developmental biologists. The neural crest is the name given to the fold of ectoderm at the junction between neural and epidermal ectoderm in neurula-stage vertebrate embryos. In this sense, the neural crest is a morphological term akin to head fold or limb bud. This region of the dorsal neural tube consists of neural crest cells, a special population(s) of cell, that give rise to an astonishing number of cell types and to an equally astonishing number of tissues and organs. Neural crest cell contributions may be direct — providing cells — or indirect — providing a necessary, often inductive, environment in which other cells develop. The enormous range of cell types produced provides an important source of evidence of the neural crest as a germ layer, bringing the number of germ layers to four — ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm, and neural crest. In this paper I provide a brief overview of the major phases of investigation into the neural crest and the major players involved, discuss how the origin of the neural crest relates to the origin of the nervous system in vertebrate embryos, discuss the impact on the germ-layer theory of the discovery of the neural crest and of secondary neurulation, and present evidence of the neural crest as the fourth germ layer. A companion paper (Hall, <i>Evol. Biol</i>. 2008) deals with the evolutionary origins of the neural crest and neural crest cells.</p>

				<title>Bacterial persistence: some new insights into an old phenomenon</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0795-0805</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bigger discovered more than 60 years ago, at the very beginning of the antibiotic era, that populations of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria contained a very small fraction (approximately 10<sup>–6</sup>) of antibiotic-tolerant cells (persisters). Persisters are different from antibiotic-resistant mutants in that their antibiotic tolerance is non-heritable and reversible. In spite of its importance as an interesting biological phenomenon and in the treatment of infectious diseases, persistence did not attract the attention of the scientific community for more than four decades since its discovery. The main reason for this lack of interest was the difficulty in isolating sufficient numbers of persister cells for experimentation, since the proportion of persisters in a population of wild-type cells is extremely small. However, with the discovery of high-persister (<i>hip</i>) mutants of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by Moyed and his group in the early 1980s, the phenomenon attracted the attention of many groups and significant progress has occurred since then. It is now believed that persistence is the end result of a stochastic switch in the expression of some toxin–antitoxin (TA) modules (of which the <i>hipA</i> and <i>hipB</i> genes could be examples), creating an imbalance in their intracellular levels. There are also models invoking the involvement of the alarmone (p) ppGpp in the generation of persisters. However, the precise mechanisms are still unknown. Bacterial persistence is part of a wider gamut of phenomena variously called as bistability, multistability, phenotypic heterogeneity, stochastic switching processes, etc. It has attracted the attention of not only microbiologists but also a diverse band of researchers such as biofilm researchers, evolutionary biologists, sociobiologists, etc. In this article, I attempt to present a broad overview of bacterial persistence to illustrate its significance and the need for further exploration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The biotransformation of acrylonitrile was investigated using thermophilic nitrilase produced from a new isolate Streptomyces sp. MTCC 7546 in both the free and immobilized state. Under optimal conditions, the enzyme converts nitriles to acids without the formation of amides. The whole cells of the isolate were immobilized in agar-agar and the beads so formed were evaluated for 25 cycles at 50&#176;C. The enzyme showed a little loss of activity during reuse. Seventy-one per cent of 0.5 M acrylonitrile was converted to acid at 6 h of incubation at a very low density of immobilized cells, while 100% conversion was observed at 3 h by free cells.</p>

				<title>Conserved water-mediated H-bonding dynamics of catalytic Asn 175 in plant thiol protease</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0027-0034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of invariant water molecules in the activity of plant cysteine protease is ubiquitous in nature. On analysing the 11 different Protein DataBank (PDB) structures of plant thiol proteases, the two invariant water molecules W1 and W2 (W220 and W222 in the template 1PPN structure) were observed to form H-bonds with the O<sub>b</sub> atom of Asn 175. Extensive energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation studies up to 2 ns on all the PDB and solvated structures clearly revealed the involvement of the H-bonding association of the two water molecules in fixing the orientation of the asparagine residue of the catalytic triad. From this study, it is suggested that H-bonding of the water molecule at the W1 invariant site better stabilizes the Asn residue at the active site of the catalytic triad.</p>

				<title>Immunization with a synthetic robustoxin derivative lacking disulphide bridges protects against a potentially lethal challenge with funnel-web spider (<i>Atrax robustus</i>) venom</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0035-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The venom of male <i>Atrax robustus</i> spiders is potentially lethal to primates. These spiders have been responsible for a number of human deaths. Robustoxin is the lethal toxin in the venom. It is a highly cross-linked polypeptide that has 42 amino acid residues and four disulphide bridges. If these bridges are broken, the resulting polypeptide is nontoxic. Robustoxin was chemically synthesized with all of its eight cysteine residues protected with acetamidomethyl groups in order to avoid formation of disulphide bridges. The resulting derivative was co-polymerized with keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Two <i>Macaca fascicularis</i> monkeys were immunized with this conjugate. The monkeys were challenged, under anaesthesia, with a potentially lethal dose of male <i>A. robustus</i> crude venom. Both monkeys showed some minor symptoms of intoxication but recovered fully with no adverse after-effects. Immunization with the same immunogen, in the absence of keyhole limpet haemocyanin, did not protect a third monkey. The N-terminal 23 amino acid peptide derived from the sequence of robustoxin was synthesized and conjugated with ovalbumin. A fourth monkey was immunized with this conjugate. However, it was not protected against challenge. The implications of these results for the preparation of synthetic peptide vaccines are discussed.</p>

				<title>Construction of an infectious cDNA clone of foot-and-mouth disease virus type O<sub>1</sub>BFS 1860 and its use in the preparation of candidate vaccine</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0045-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O is the most predominant among the endemic serotypes in India. A stable, full-length cDNA clone of FMDV type O<sub>1</sub>BFS 1860 preceded by a bacteriophage T7 polymerase promoter was assembled in a plasmid vector pGEM<sup>R</sup>-7Zf(–). An &#8764;8.2 kb PCR product was amplified from the cDNA clone and a full-length RNA was generated from it by <i>in vitro</i> transcription. Transfection of BHK-21 cells with the <i>in vitro</i> transcripts resulted in the production of infectious recombinant FMDV particles as evidenced by cytopathic effects (CPE). Further, characterization of the recombinant virus by immunofluorescence, microneutralization test (MNT), antigen ELISA, RT-PCR, plaque assay and electron microscopy revealed similarity to the parental strain. The immunogenicity of an oil-adjuvant vaccine prepared using the inactivated recombinant virus was tested in guinea pigs and cattle. Neutralizing antibodies were produced in both vaccinated guinea pigs and cattle. Vaccinated animals were protected on challenge. The results demonstrated that the recombinant virus was as stable and effective as the parental strain for the preparation of inactivated vaccine, suggesting the potential application of this strategy to make genetically engineered FMDV vaccines.</p>

				<title>Replica-moulded polydimethylsiloxane culture vessel lids attenuate osmotic drift in long-term cell cultures</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0059-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An imbalance in medium osmolarity is a determinant that affects cell culture longevity. Even in humidified incubators, evaporation of water leads to a gradual increase in osmolarity overtime. We present a simple replica-moulding strategy for producing self-sealing lids adaptable to standard, small-size cell-culture vessels. They are made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a flexible, transparent and biocompatible material, which is gas-permeable but largely impermeable to water. Keeping cell cultures in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#176;C, medium osmolarity increased by +6.86 mosmol/kg/day in standard 35 mm Petri dishes, while PDMS lids attenuated its rise by a factor of four to changes of +1.72 mosmol/kg/ day. Depending on the lid membrane thickness, pH drifts at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels were attenuated by a factor of 4 to 9. Comparative evaporation studies at temperatures below 60&#176;C yielded a 10-fold reduced water vapour flux of 1.75 g/day/dm<sup>2</sup> through PDMS lids as compared with 18.69 g/day/dm<sup>2</sup> with conventional Petri dishes. Using such PDMS lids, about 2/3 of the cell cultures grew longer than 30 days <i>in vitro</i>. Among these, the average survival time was 69 days with the longest survival being 284 days under otherwise conventional cell culture conditions.</p>

				<title>Molecular evolution of the E8 promoter in tomato and some of its relative wild species</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0071-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>E8</i> gene is related to ethylene biosynthesis in plants. To explore the effect of the expression pattern of the <i>E8</i> gene on different <i>E8</i> promoters, the molecular evolution of <i>E8</i> promoters was investigated. A total of 16 <i>E8</i> promoters were cloned from 16 accessions of seven tomato species, and were further analysed. The results from 19 <i>E8</i> promoters including three previously cloned <i>E8</i> promoters (X13437, DQ317599 and AF515784) showed that the size of the <i>E8</i> promoters varied from 2101 bp (LA2150) to 2256 bp (LA2192); their sequences shared 69.9% homology and the average A/T content was 74.9%. Slide-window analysis divided <i>E8</i> promoters into three regions – A, B and C – and the sequence identity in these regions was 72.5%, 41.2% and 70.8%, respectively. By searching the <i>cis</i>-elements of <i>E8</i> promoters in the PLACE database, mutant nucleotides were found in some functional elements, and deletions or insertions were also found in regions responsible for ethylene biosysnthesis (–1702 to –1274) and the negative effect region (–1253 to –936). Our results indicate that the size of the functional region for ethylene biosynthesis in the <i>E8</i> promoter could be shortened from 429 bp to 113 bp (–1612 to –1500). The results of molecular evolution analysis showed that the 19 <i>E8</i> promoters could be classified into four clade groups, which is basically consistent with evolution of the tomato genome. Southern blot analysis results showed that the copy number of <i>E8</i> promoters in tomato and some other wild species changed from 1 to 4. Taken together, our study provides important information for further elucidating the <i>E8</i> gene expression pattern in tomato, analysing functional elements in the <i>E8</i> promoter and reconstructing the potent <i>E8</i> promoter.</p>

				<title>Genetic analysis of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype A of Indian origin and detection of positive selection and recombination in leader protease- and capsid-coding regions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0085-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The leader protease (L<sup>pro</sup>) and capsid-coding sequences (P1) constitute approximately 3 kb of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). We studied the phylogenetic relationship of 46 FMDV serotype A isolates of Indian origin collected during the period 1968–2005 and also eight vaccine strains using the neighbour-joining tree and Bayesian tree methods. The viruses were categorized under three major groups – Asian, Euro-South American and European. The Indian isolates formed a distinct genetic group among the Asian isolates. The Indian isolates were further classified into different genetic subgroups (&#60; 5% divergence). Post-1995 isolates were divided into two subgroups while a few isolates which originated in the year 2005 from Andhra Pradesh formed a separate group. These isolates were closely related to the isolates of the 1970s. The FMDV isolates seem to undergo reverse mutation or convergent evolution wherein sequences identical to the ancestors are present in the isolates in circulation. The eight vaccine strains included in the study were not related to each other and belonged to different genetic groups. Recombination was detected in the L<sup>pro</sup> region in one isolate (A IND 20/82) and in the VP1 coding 1D region in another isolate (A RAJ 21/96). Positive selection was identified at aa positions 23 in the L<sup>pro</sup> (𝑃 &#60; 0.05; 0.046*) and at aa 171 in the capsid protein VP1 (𝑃 &#60; 0.01; 0.003**).</p>

				<title>Large cryptic internal sequence repeats in protein structures from <i>Homo sapiens</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0103-0112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amino acid sequences are known to constantly mutate and diverge unless there is a limiting condition that makes such a change deleterious. However, closer examination of the sequence and structure reveals that a few large, cryptic repeats are nevertheless sequentially conserved. This leads to the question of why only certain repeats are conserved at the sequence level. It would be interesting to find out if these sequences maintain their conservation at the three-dimensional structure level. They can play an active role in protein and nucleotide stability, thus not only ensuring proper functioning but also potentiating malfunction and disease. Therefore, insights into any aspect of the repeats – be it structure, function or evolution – would prove to be of some importance. This study aims to address the relationship between protein sequence and its three-dimensional structure, by examining if large cryptic sequence repeats have the same structure.</p>

				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0113-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is small, double-stranded DNA virus that infects mucosal and cutaneous epithelial tissue. HPV is sexually transmitted and the viral DNA replicates extrachromosomally. The virus is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral capsid. There are approximately 118 types of HPV, which are characterized as high-risk or low-risk types. High-risk HPVs cause malignant transformation while the low-risk ones cause benign warts and lesions. The expression of E6 and E7 is normally controlled during the normal viral life cycle when viral DNA replicates extrachromosomally. HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins are overexpressed when the viral genome integrates into the host DNA. Deregulated overexpression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins can cause several changes in cellular pathways and functions leading to malignant transformation of cells and tumorigenesis. In this review, we focus on several cellular mechanisms and pathways that are altered in the presence of E6 and E7, the target proteins of E6 and E7 inside the host cell and how they contribute to the development of the transformed phenotype..</p>

				<title>Tropospheric ozone as a fungal elicitor</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0125-0138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tropospheric ozone has been proven to trigger biochemical plant responses that are similar to the ones induced by an attack of fungal pathogens, i.e. it resembles fungal elicitors. This suggests that ozone can represent a valid tool for the study of stress responses and induction of resistance to pathogens. This review provides an overview of the implications of such a phenomenon for basic and applied research. After an introduction about the environmental implications of tropospheric ozone and plant responses to biotic stresses, the biochemistry of ozone stress is analysed, pointing out its similarities with plant responses to pathogens and its possible applications.</p>

				<title>Neurospora as a model fungus for studies in cytogenetics and sexual biology at Stanford</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0139-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dodge’s early work (1927–1940) on <i>Neurospora</i> genetics and sexual biology inspired Beadle and Tatum at Stanford to use <i>N. crassa</i> for their landmark discovery that genes specify enzymes. <i>Neurospora</i> has since become a model organism for numerous genetic, cytogenetic, biochemical, molecular and population biology studies. <i>Neurospora</i> is haploid in the vegetative phase with a transient diploid sexual phase. Its meiotic cells (asci) are large, allowing easy examination of dividing nuclei and chromosomes under a light microscope. The haploid meiotic products are themselves the sexual progeny that grow into vegetative cultures, thus avoiding the cumbersome testcrosses and complex dominance–recessive relationships, as in diploid organisms. The Perkins’ laboratory at Stanford (1949–2007) played a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of <i>Neurospora genetics</i>, sexual biology, cytogenetics and population biology. Since 1974, I have taken advantage of various chromosome-staining methods to examine ascus and ascospore development in wild type and in numerous mutant strains. In addition, I have used GFP-tagged genes to visualize the expression or silencing of unpaired genes in a post-transcriptional gene silencing process (meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA) that operates specifically during meiosis. The genome of <i>N. crassa</i> contains over 10 000 protein-coding genes. Gene knockouts or mutations in specific sequences may now be readily correlated with the observed cytological defects in the sexual stage, thus advancing our molecular understanding of complex processes during ascus and ascospore development.</p>

				<title>Inactivation of a transgene due to transposition of insertion sequence (IS136) of <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i></title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0199-0202</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Agrobacterium</i> strains harbour insertion sequences, which are known to transpose into genomes as well as into Ti plasmids. In this study we report the inactivation of a transgene due to transposition of the <i>A. tumefaciens</i> insertion sequence IS136. The transposition was discovered following transformation of plant tissues, although the fidelity of the binary vector was confirmed following transformation into <i>Agrobacterium</i>. Such transpositions are rare but can occur and it is thus important to check the fidelity of the binary vector at different times of <i>Agrobacterium</i> growth in order to avoid failure in achieving transgene expression.</p>

				<title>Functional role of EF-hands 3 and 4 in membrane-binding of KChIP1</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0203-0211</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of the present study is to explore whether membrane targeting of K<sup>+</sup> channel-interacting protein 1 (KChIP1) is associated with its EF-hand motifs and varies with specific phospholipids. Truncated KChIP1, in which the EF-hands 3 and 4 were deleted, retained the 𝛼-helix structure, indicating that the N-terminal half of KChIP1 could fold appropriately. Compared with wild-type KChIP1, truncated KChIP1 exhibited lower lipid-binding capability. Compared with wild-type KChIP1, increasing membrane permeability by the use of digitonin caused a marked loss of truncated KChIP1, suggesting that intact EF-hands 3 and 4 were crucial for the anchorage of KChIP1 on membrane. KChIP1 showed a higher binding capability with phosphatidylserine (PS) than truncated KChIP1. Unlike that of truncated KChIP1, the binding of wild-type KChIP1 with membrane was enhanced by increasing the PS content. Moreover, the binding of KChIP1 with phospholipid vesicles induced a change in the structure of KChIP1 in the presence of PS. Taken together, our data suggest that EF-hands 3 and 4 of KChIP1 are functionally involved in a specific association with PS on the membrane.</p>

				<title>Identification of binding peptides of the ADAM15 disintegrin domain using phage display</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0213-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>ADAM15 plays an important role in tumour development by interacting with integrins. In this study, we investigated the target peptides of the ADAM15 disintegrin domain. First, we successfully produced the recombinant human ADAM15 disintegrin domain (RADD) that could inhibit melanoma cell adhesion by using <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Second, four specific binding peptides (peptides A, B, C, and D) were selected using a phage display 12-mer peptide library. The screening protocol involved 4 rounds of positive panning on RADD and 2 rounds of subtractive selection with streptavidin. By using the BLAST software and a relevant protein database, integrin 𝛼<sub>v</sub>𝛽<sub>3</sub> was found to be homologous to peptide A. Synthetic peptide A had a highly inhibitory effect on RADD–integrin 𝛼<sub>v</sub>𝛽<sub>3</sub> binding. The results demonstrate the potential application of short peptides for disrupting high-affinity ADAM–integrin interactions.</p>

				<title>Selection of scFvs specific for the HepG2 cell line using ribosome display</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0221-0226</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this study was to construct a ribosome display library of single chain variable fragments (scFvs) associated with hepatocarcinoma and screen such a library for hepatocarcinoma-binding scFvs. mRNA was isolated from the spleens of mice immunized with hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Heavy and k chain genes (VH and k) were amplified separately by RT-PCR, and an anti-HepG2 VH/k chain ribosome display library was constructed by assembling VH and k into the VH/k chain with a specially constructed linker by SOE-PCR. The VH/k chain library was transcribed and translated <i>in vitro</i> using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. In order to isolate specific scFvs, recognizing HepG2 negative selection on a normal hepatocyte line WRL-68 was carried out before three rounds of positive selection on HepG2. After three rounds of panning, cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that one of the scFvs had high affinity for the HepG2 cell and lower affinity for the WRL-68 cell. In this study, we successfully constructed a native ribosome display library. Such a library would prove useful for direct intact cell panning using ribosome display technology. The selected scFv had a potential value for hepatocarcinoma treatment.</p>

				<title>Cloning and sequence analysis of putative type II fatty acid synthase genes from <i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0227-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The cultivated peanut is a valuable source of dietary oil and ranks fifth among the world oil crops. Plant fatty acid biosynthesis is catalysed by type II fatty acid synthase (FAS) in plastids and mitochondria. By constructing a full-length cDNA library derived from immature peanut seeds and homology-based cloning, candidate genes of acyl carrier protein (ACP), malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase, 𝛽-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (I, II, III), 𝛽-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, 𝛽-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase and enoyl-ACP reductase were isolated. Sequence alignments revealed that primary structures of type II FAS enzymes were highly conserved in higher plants and the catalytic residues were strictly conserved in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and higher plants. Homologue numbers of each type II FAS gene expressing in developing peanut seeds varied from 1 in KASII, KASIII and HD to 5 in ENR. The number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was quite different in each gene. Peanut type II FAS genes were predicted to target plastids except <i>ACP2</i> and <i>ACP3</i>. The results suggested that peanut may contain two type II FAS systems in plastids and mitochondria. The type II FAS enzymes in higher plants may have similar functions as those in <i>E. coli</i>.</p>

				<title>Interaction of 18-residue peptides derived from amphipathic helical segments of globular proteins with model membranes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0239-0250</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated the interaction of six 18-residue peptides derived from amphipathic helical segments of globular proteins with model membranes. The net charge of the peptides at neutral pH varies from –1 to +6. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that peptides with a high net positive charge tend to fold into a helical conformation in the presence of negatively charged lipid vesicles. In helical conformation, their average hydrophobic moment and hydrophobicity would render them surface-active. The composition of amino acids on the polar face of the helix in the peptides is considerably different. The peptides show variations in their ability to permeabilise zwitterionic and anionic lipid vesicles. Whereas increased net positive charge favours greater permeabilisation, the distribution of charged residues in the polar face also plays a role in determining membrane activity. The distribution of amino acids in the polar face of the helix in the peptides that were investigated do not fall into the canonical classes described. Amphipathic helices, which are part of proteins, with a pattern of amino acid distribution different from those observed in class L, A and others, could help in providing newer insights into peptide–membrane interactions.</p>

				<title>Physical mapping, expression analysis and polymorphism survey of resistance gene analogues on chromosome 11 of rice</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0251-0261</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rice is the first cereal genome with a finished sequence and a model crop that has important syntenic relationships with other cereal species. The objectives of our study were to identify resistance gene analogue (RGA) sequences from chromosome 11 of rice, understand their expression in other cereals and dicots by <i>in silico</i> analysis, determine their presence on other rice chromosomes, and evaluate the extent of polymorphism and actual expression in a set of rice genotypes. A total of 195 RGAs were predicted and physically localised. Of these, 91.79% expressed in rice, and 51.28% expressed in wheat, which was the highest among other cereals. Among monocots, sugarcane showed the highest (78.92%) expression, while among dicots, RGAs were maximally expressed in Arabidopsis (11.79%). Interestingly, two of the chromosome 11-specific RGAs were found to be expressing in all the organisms studied. Eighty RGAs of chromosome 11 had significant homology with chromosome 12, which was the maximum among all the rice chromosomes. Thirty-one per cent of the RGAs used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification showed polymorphism in a set of rice genotypes. Actual gene expression analysis revealed post-inoculation induction of one RGA in the rice line IRBB-4 carrying the bacterial blight resistance gene <i>Xa-4</i>. Our results have implications for the development of sequence-based markers and functional validation of specific RGAs in rice.</p>

				<title>Variations in morphological and life-history traits under extreme temperatures in <i>Drosophila ananassae</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0263-0274</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using half-sib analysis, we analysed the consequences of extreme rearing temperatures on genetic and phenotypic variations in the morphological and life-history traits of <i>Drosophila ananassae</i>. Paternal half-sib covariance contains a relatively small proportion of the epistatic variance and lacks the dominance variance and variance due to maternal effect, which provides more reliable estimates of additive genetic variance. Experiments were performed on a mass culture population of <i>D. ananassae</i> collected from Kanniyakumari (India). Two extremely stressful temperatures (18&#176;C and 32&#176;C) and one standard temperature (25&#176;C) were used to examine the effect of stressful and non-stressful environments on the morphological and life-history traits in males and females. Mean values of various morphological traits differed significantly among different temperature regimens in both males and females. Rearing at 18&#176;C and 32&#176;C resulted in decreased thorax length, wing-to-thorax (w/t) ratio, sternopleural bristle number, ovariole number, sex comb-tooth number and testis length. Phenotypic variances increased under stressful temperatures in comparison with non-stressful temperatures. Heritability and evolvability based on among-sires (males), among-dams (females), and the sum of the two components (sire + dam) showed higher values at both the stressful temperatures than at the non-stressful temperature. These differences reflect changes in additive genetic variance. Viability was greater at the high than the low extreme temperature. As viability is an indicator of stress, we can assume that stress was greater at 18&#176;C than at 32&#176;C in <i>D. ananassae</i>. The genetic variations for all the quantitative and life-history traits were higher at low temperature. Variation in sexual traits was more pronounced as compared with other morphometric traits, which shows that sexual traits are more prone to thermal stress. Our results agree with the hypothesis that genetic variation is increased in stressful environments.</p>

				<title>Effect of directional selection for body size on fluctuating asymmetry in certain morphological traits in <i>Drosophila ananassae</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0275-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variation in the subtle differences between the right and left sides of bilateral characters or fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been considered as an indicator of an organism’s ability to cope with genetic and environmental stresses during development. However, due to inconsistency in the results of empirical studies, the relationship between FA and stress has been the subject of intense debate. In this study, we investigated whether stress caused by artificial bidirectional selection for body size has any effect on the levels of FA of different morphological traits in <i>Drosophila ananassae</i>. The realised heritability (h<sup>2</sup>) was higher in low-line females and high-line males, which suggests an asymmetrical response to selection for body size. Further, the levels of FA were compared across 10 generations of selection in different selection lines in both sexes for sternopleural bristle number, wing length, wing-to-thorax ratio, sex combtooth number and ovariole number. The levels of FA differed significantly among generations and selection lines but did not change markedly with directional selection. However, the levels of FA were higher in the G10 generation (at the end of selection) than G0 (at the start of selection) but lower than the G5 generation in different selection lines, suggesting that the levels of FA are not affected by the inbreeding generated during the course of selection. Also, the levels of FA in the hybrids of high and low lines were significantly lower than the parental selection lines, suggesting that FA is influenced by hybridisation. These results are discussed in the framework of the literature available on FA and its relationship with stress.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We recorded the <i>in vivo</i> emission and time-resolved spectra of the firefly <i>Luciola praeusta</i> Kiesenwetter 1874 (Coleoptera : Lampyridae : Luciolinae). The emission spectrum shows that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value for this particular species is 55 nm, which is significantly narrower than the <i>in vivo</i> half-widths reported till now. The time-resolved spectrum reveals that a flash of about 100 ms duration is, in fact, composed of a number of microsecond pulses. This suggests that the speed of the enzyme-catalysed chemiluminescence reaction in the firefly for the emission of light is much faster than was previously believed.</p>

				<title>Rapid aggregation and assembly in aqueous solution of A𝛽 (25-35) peptide</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0293-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The highly toxic A𝛽(25-35) is a peculiar peptide that differs from all the other commonly studied 𝛽-amyloid peptides because of its extremely rapid aggregation properties and enhanced neurotoxicity. We investigated A𝛽(25-35) aggregation in H<sub>2</sub>O at pH 3.0 and at pH 7.4 by means of in-solution analyses. Adopting UV spectroscopy, Congo red spectrophotometry and thioflavin T fluorimetry, we were able to quantify, in water, the very fast assembling time necessary for A𝛽(25-35) to form stable insoluble aggregates and their ability to seed or not seed fibril growth. Our quantitative results, which confirm a very rapid assembly leading to stable insoluble aggregates of A𝛽(25-35) only when incubated at pH 7.4, might be helpful for designing novel aggregation inhibitors and to shed light on the <i>in vivo</i> environment in which fibril formation takes place.</p>

				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0305-0312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is one of the key cell-cycle regulating proteins and its inactivation leads to neoplastic transformation and carcinogenesis. This protein regulates critical G<sub>1</sub>-to-S phase transition through interaction with the E2F family of cell-cycle transcription factors repressing transcription of genes required for this cell-cycle check-point transition. Its activity is regulated through network sensing intracellular and extracellular signals which block or permit phosphorylation (inactivation) of the Rb protein. Mechanisms of Rb-dependent cell-cycle control have been widely studied over the past couple of decades. However, recently it was found that pRb also regulates apoptosis through the same interaction with E2F transcription factors and that Rb–E2F complexes play a role in regulating the transcription of genes involved in differentiation and development.</p>

				<title>MMP-1 polymorphism and its relationship to pathological processes</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0313-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc (Zn)-dependent endopeptidases that are collectively capable of cleaving virtually all extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates and play an important role in diverse physiological and pathological processes. The activity of MMPs is regulated at multiple levels. The transcriptional regulation of MMP appears to represent the key step in MMP regulation. There are diverse types of MMPs that differ structural and functionally. MMP-1 is the most ubiquitously expressed interstitial collagenase and has a prominent role in initial cleavage of the ECM. The level of MMP-1 expression can be influenced by different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region. A functional polymorphism at position –1607 has been shown to alter the transcriptional activity of MMP-1 and was associated with diverse pathological processes. The aim of our review was to discuss some topics related to MMP in physiological and pathological processes, with a focus on MMP-1 polymorphism.</p>

				<title>Living with urea stress</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0321-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intracellular organic osmolytes are present in certain organisms adapted to harsh environments. These osmolytes protect intracellular macromolecules against denaturing environmental stress. In contrast to the usually benign effects of most organic osmolytes, the waste product urea is a well-known perturbant of macromolecules. Although urea is a perturbing solute which inhibits enzyme activity and stability, it is employed by some species as a major osmolyte. The answer to this paradox was believed to be the discovery of protective osmolytes (methylamines). We review the current state of knowledge on the various ways of counteracting the harmful effects of urea in nature and the mechanisms for this. This review ends with the mechanistic idea that cellular salt (KCl/NaCl) plays a crucial role in counteracting the effects of urea, either by inducing required chaperones or methylamines, or by thermodynamic interactions with urea-destabilised proteins. We also propose future opportunities and challenges in the field.</p>

				<title>Thermal stability of 𝛼-amylase in aqueous cosolvent systems</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0377-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The activity and thermal stability of 𝛼-amylase were studied in the presence of different concentrations of trehalose, sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol. The optimum temperature of the enzyme was found to be 50 &#177; 2&#176;C. Further increase in temperature resulted in irreversible thermal inactivation of the enzyme. In the presence of cosolvents, the rate of thermal inactivation was found to be significantly reduced. The apparent thermal denaturation temperature (𝑇<sub>𝑚</sub>)<sub>app</sub> and activation energy (𝐸<sub>𝑎</sub>) of 𝛼-amylase were found to be significantly increased in the presence of cosolvents in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of 40% trehalose, sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol, increments in the (𝑇<sub>𝑚</sub>)<sub>app</sub> were 20&#176;C, 14&#176;C, 13&#176;C and 9&#176;C, respectively. The 𝐸<sub>𝑎</sub> of thermal denaturation of 𝛼-amylase in the presence of 20% (w/v) trehalose, sorbitol, sucrose and glycerol was found to be 126, 95, 90 and 43 kcal/mol compared with a control value of 40 kcal/mol. Intrinsic and 8-anilinonaphathalene-1-sulphonic acid (ANS) fluorescence studies indicated that thermal denaturation of the enzyme was accompanied by exposure of the hydrophobic cluster on the protein surface. Preferential interaction parameters indicated extensive hydration of the enzyme in the presence of cosolvents.</p>

				<title>GalNAc-T14 may be involved in regulating the apoptotic action of IGFBP-3</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0389-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is known to induce apoptosis in an insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-dependent and IGF-independent manner, but the mechanism underlying the IGF-independent effects remains unclear. Polypeptide 𝑁-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 14 (GalNAc-T14) is a novel IGFBP-3 binding partner. In this paper, small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting GalNAc-T14 was used to examine whether GalNAc-T14 affects the apoptotic action of IGFBP-3. Using semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis, we determined that GalNAc-T14 expression was downregulated by the siRNA directed against GalNAc-T14. Apoptosis analysis of IGFBP-3-overexpressing cells treated with siRNA against GalNAc-T14 was performed to determine if GalNAc-T14 was specifically involved in IGFBP-3 signalling. The results, as determined by flow cytometric analysis and caspase-3 assay, showed that the extent of apoptosis induced by IGFBP-3 increased with RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of GalNAc-T14. Our data suggest that GalNAc-T14 influences the apoptotic action of IGFBP-3 and might mediate the signalling pathway of IGFBP-3. Experiments to determine the role of GalNAc-T14 in the regulation of apoptosis induced by IGFBP-3 are under way.</p>

				<title>Single-nucleotide variations associated with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> KwaZulu-Natal strains</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0397-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrence of drug resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, the aetiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), is hampering the management and control of TB in the world. Here we present a computational analysis of recently sequenced drug-sensitive (DS), multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were identified in a pair-wise manner using the anchor-based whole genome comparison (ABWGC) tool and its modified version. For this analysis, four fully sequenced genomes of different strains of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> were taken along with three KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) strains isolated from South Africa including one XDR and one MDR strain. KZN strains were compared with other fully sequenced strains and also among each other. The variations were analysed with respect to their biological influence as a result of either altered structure or synthesis. The results suggest that the DR phenotype may be due to changes in a number of genes. The database on KZN strains can be accessed through the website <i>http://mirna.jnu.ac.in/mgdd/.</i></p>

				<title>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 𝛾 and their association with plasma levels of resistin and the metabolic syndrome in a South Indian population</title> 
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0405-0414</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studies on the association of the Pro12Ala and C1431T polymorphisms of <i>PPAR𝛾</i> with diabetes and obesity have revealed extensive population-dependent variations. However, association of these polymorphisms with the metabolic syndrome and its individual components has not been well investigated in the Indian population. The Indian population harbours the maximum number of diabetics in the world who are thus more susceptible to metabolic disorders. We screened a South Indian population (𝑁 = 699) for a possible association of these polymorphisms with the metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes. We also investigated the correlation of these two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with plasma resistin levels. The C1431T SNP was associated with higher levels of plasma resistin (𝑃 = 0.017). Furthermore, C1431T was associated with resistin in different tertiles. Prevalence of the ‘Pro-C’ haplotype decreased with increasing tertiles of resistin (84.1% to 75.4%, 𝑃 = 0.037). Plasma resistin levels were not found to be associated with MS and type 2 diabetes. These results point to a likely association of plasma resistin levels with <i>PPAR</i>𝛾 polymorphisms in the Indian population.</p>

				<title><i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> germline mutation analysis among Indian women from south India: identification of four novel mutations and high-frequency occurrence of 185delAG mutation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0415-0422</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mutations in the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes profoundly increase the risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer among women. To explore the contribution of <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations in the development of hereditary breast cancer among Indian women, we carried out mutation analysis of the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes in 61 breast or ovarian cancer patients from south India with a positive family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Mutation analysis was carried out using conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) followed by sequencing. Mutations were identified in 17 patients (28.0%); 15 (24.6%) had <i>BRCA1</i> mutations and two (3.28%) had <i>BRCA2</i> mutations. While no specific association between <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> mutations with cancer type was seen, mutations were more often seen in families with ovarian cancer. While 40% (4/10) and 30.8% (4/12) of families with ovarian or breast and ovarian cancer had mutations, only 23.1% (9/39) of families with breast cancer carried mutations in the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes. In addition, while <i>BRCA1</i> mutations were found in all age groups, <i>BRCA2</i> mutations were found only in the age group of &#8804; 40 years. Of the <i>BRCA1</i> mutations, there were three novel mutations (295delCA; 4213T &#8594; A; 5267T &#8594; G) and three mutations that have been reported earlier. Interestingly, 185delAG, a <i>BRCA1</i> mutation which occurs at a very high frequency in Ashkenazi Jews, was found at a frequency of 16.4% (10/61). There was one novel mutation (4866insT) and one reported mutation in <i>BRCA2</i>. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of mutation screening in familial breast and/or ovarian cancers, and the potential implications of these findings in genetic counselling and preventive therapy.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0423-0433</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We describe a highly efficient and reproducible <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation protocol applicable to several varieties of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, earlier known as <i>Lycopersicum esculentum</i>). Conditions such as co-cultivation period, bacterial concentration, concentration of benzyl amino purine (BAP), zeatin and indole acetic acid (IAA) were optimized. Co-cultivation of explants with a bacterial concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml for three days on 2 mg/l BAP, followed by regeneration on a medium containing 1 mg/ml zeatin resulted in a transformation frequency of 41.4%. Transformation of tomato plants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis and 𝛽-glucuronidase (GUS) assay. The protocol developed showed very high efficiency of transformation for tomato varieties Pusa Ruby, Arka Vikas and Sioux. The optimized transformation procedure is simple, efficient and does not require tobacco, <i>Petunia</i>, tomato suspension feeder layer or acetosyringone.</p>

				<title>Association preference and mechanism of kin recognition in tadpoles of the toad <i>Bufo melanostictus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0435-0444</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In experiments with specially designed choice tanks, tadpoles of <i>Bufo melanostictus</i> spend significantly greater amounts of time near kin than near non-kin. However, in the absence of kin members, they prefer to spend more time near non-kin rather than stay away in isolation in the opposite blank zone with no company. This implies that association of toad tadpoles with their kin is due to attraction rather than repulsion from non-kin. Experiments designed to elucidate the sensory basis of kin recognition showed that toad tadpoles recognize their kin based on chemical cues rather than visual cues. They can also discriminate between homospecific non-kin and heterospecific (<i>Sphaerotheca breviceps</i>) tadpoles since the tadpoles spent significantly greater amounts of time near the former than near the latter. These findings suggest that where kin members are unavailable, selection may have favoured living with non-kin so as to derive benefits from group living and that a phenotype-matching mechanism may operate for both kin and species discrimination in <i>B. melanostictus</i>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cyclic adenosine 5&#8242;-phosphate (cAMP) is a global regulator of gene expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Despite decades of intensive study, the quantitative effect and regulatory function of cAMP remain the subjects of considerable debate. Here, we analyse the data in the literature to show that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>In carbon-limited cultures (including cultures limited by glucose), cAMP is at near-saturation levels with respect to expression of several catabolic promoters (including <i>lac, ara</i> and <i>gal</i>). It follows that cAMP-mediated regulation cannot account for the strong repression of these operons in the presence of glucose.</li>
						<li>The cAMP levels in carbon-excess cultures are substantially lower than those observed in carbon-limited cultures. Under these conditions, the expression of catabolic promoters is very sensitive to variation of cAMP levels.</li>
						<li>cAMP · CRP invariably activates the expression of catabolic promoters, but it appears to inhibit the expression of anabolic promoters.</li>
						<li>These results suggest that the physiological function of cAMP is to maintain homeostatic energy levels.</li>
					</ul> 
					<p>In carbon-limited cultures, growth is limited by the supply of energy; the cAMP levels therefore increase to enhance energy accumulation by activating the catabolic promoters and inhibiting the anabolic promoters. Conversely, in carbon-excess cultures, characterized by the availability of excess energy, the cAMP levels decrease in order to depress energy accumulation by inhibiting the catabolic promoters and activating the anabolic promoters.</p>

				<title>Structure–function–folding relationships and native energy landscape of dynein light chain protein: nuclear magnetic resonance insights</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0465-0479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The detailed characterization of the structure, dynamics and folding process of a protein is crucial for understanding the biological functions it performs. Modern biophysical and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have provided a way to obtain accurate structural and thermodynamic information on various species populated on the energy landscape of a given protein. In this context, we review here the structure–function–folding relationship of an important protein, namely, dynein light chain protein (DLC8). DLC8, the smallest subunit of the dynein motor complex, acts as a cargo adaptor. The protein exists as a dimer under physiological conditions and dissociates into a pure monomer below pH 4. Cargo binding occurs at the dimer interface. Dimer stability and relay of perturbations through the dimer interface are anticipated to be playing crucial roles in the variety of functions the protein performs. NMR investigations have provided great insights into these aspects of DLC8 in recent years.</p>

				<title>Influenza A (H1N1) 2009: a pandemic alarm</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0481-0489</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At this critical juncture when the world has not yet recovered from the threat of avian influenza, the virus has returned in the disguise of swine influenza, a lesser known illness common in pigs. It has reached pandemic proportions in a short time span with health personnel still devising ways to identify the novel H1N1 virus and develop vaccines against it. The H1N1 virus has caused a considerable number of deaths within the short duration since its emergence. Presently, there are no effective methods to contain this newly emerged virus. Therefore, a proper and clear insight is urgently required to prevent an outbreak in the future and make preparations that may be planned well in advance. This review is an attempt to discuss the historical perspective of the swine flu virus, its epidemiology and route of transmission to better understand the various control measures that may be taken to fight the danger of a global pandemic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We recorded the <i>in vivo</i> emission and time-resolved spectra of the firefly <i>Luciola praeusta</i> Kiesenwetter 1874 (Coleoptera : Lampyridae : Luciolinae). The emission spectrum shows that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value for this particular species is 55 nm, which is significantly narrower than the <i>in vivo</i> half-widths reported till now. The time-resolved spectrum reveals that a flash of about 100 ms duration is, in fact, composed of a number of microsecond pulses. This suggests that the speed of the enzyme-catalysed chemiluminescence reaction in the firefly for the emission of light is much faster than was previously believed.</p>

				<title>How phenotypic plasticity made its way into molecular biology</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0495-0501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Phenotypic plasticity has been fashionable in recent years. It has never been absent from the studies of evolutionary biologists, although the availability of stable animal models has limited its role. Although opposed by the reductionist and deterministic approach of molecular biology, phenotypic plasticity has nevertheless recently made its way into this discipline, in particular through the limits of the molecular description. Its resurrection has been triggered by a small group of theoreticians, the rise of epigenetic descriptions and the publicized discovery of stem cell plasticity. The notion of phenotypic plasticity remains vague. History shows that too strong a belief in plasticity can be an obstacle to the development of biology. Two important questions are still pending: the link between the different forms of plasticity present at different levels of organization, and the relation, if any, between the modular organization of organisms and phenotypic plasticity. Future research will help to discriminate between possible and actual mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, and to give phenotypic plasticity its real place in the living world.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The urease of the human pathogen, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, is essential for pathogenesis. The ammonia produced by the enzyme neutralizes stomach acid; thereby modifying its environment. The dodecameric enzyme complex has high affinity for its substrate, urea. We compared urease sequences and derivative 3D homology model structures from all published <i>Helicobacter</i> genomes and an equal number of genomes belonging to strains of another enteric bacterium, <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We found that the enzyme’s architecture adapts to fit its niche. This finding, coupled to a survey of other physiological features responsible for the bacterium’s acid resistance, suggests how it copes with pH changes caused by disease onset and progression.</p>

				<title>Epigenetics of the yeast galactose genetic switch</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0513-0522</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The transcriptional activation of enzymes involved in galactose utilization (<i>GAL</i> genes) in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is regulated by a complex interplay between three regulatory proteins encoded by <i>GAL4</i> (transcriptional activator), <i>GAL3</i> (signal transducer) and <i>GAL80</i> (repressor). The relative concentrations of the signal transducer and the repressor are maintained by autoregulation. Cells disabled for autoregulation exhibit phenotypes distinctly different from that of the wild type cells, enabling us to explore the biological significance of autoregulation. The redundancy in signal transduction due to the presence of <i>GAL1</i> (alternate signal transducer) also makes it a suitable model to understand the phenomenon of epigenetics. In this article we review some of the recent attempts made to understand the importance of epigenetics in the establishment of cellular and transcriptional memory.</p>

				<title>Relationship among phenotypic plasticity, phenotypic fluctuations, robustness, and evolvability; Waddington's legacy revisited under the spirit of Einstein</title>

				<page>0529-0542</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Questions on possible relationship between phenotypic plasticity and evolvability, and that between robustness and evolution have been addressed over decades in the field of evolution-development. Based on laboratory evolution experiments and numerical simulations of gene expression dynamics model with an evolving transcription network, we propose quantitative relationships on plasticity, phenotypic fluctuations, and evolvability. By introducing an evolutionary stability assumption on the distribution of phenotype and genotype, the proportionality among phenotypic plasticity against environmental change, variances of phenotype fluctuations of genetic and developmental origins, and evolution speed is obtained. The correlation between developmental robustness to noise and evolutionary robustness to mutation is analysed by simulations of the gene network model. These results provide quantitative formulation on canalization and genetic assimilation, in terms of fluctuations of gene expression levels.</p>

				<title>The other side of phenotypic plasticity: a developmental system that generates an invariant phenotype despite environmental variation</title>

				<page>0543-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding how the environment impacts development is of central interest in developmental and evolutionary biology. On the one hand, we would like to understand how the environment induces phenotypic changes (the study of phenotypic plasticity). On the other hand, we may ask how a development system maintains a stable and precise phenotypic output despite the presence of environmental variation. We study such developmental robustness to environmental variation using vulval cell fate patterning in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a study system. Here we review both mechanistic and evolutionary aspects of these studies, focusing on recently obtained experimental results. First, we present evidence indicating that vulval formation is under stabilizing selection. Second, we discusss quantitative data on the precision and variability in the output of the vulval developmental system in different environments and different genetic backgrounds. Third, we illustrate how environmental and genetic variation modulate the cellular and molecular processes underlying the formation of the vulva. Fourth, we discuss the evolutionary significance of environmental sensitivity of this developmental system.</p>

				<title>Cell state switching factors and dynamical patterning modules: complementary mediators of plasticity in development and evolution</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0553-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ancient metazoan organisms arose from unicellular eukaryotes that had billions of years of genetic evolution behind them. The transcription factor networks present in single-celled ancestors at the origin of the Metazoa (multicellular animals) were already capable of mediating the switching of the unicellular phenotype among alternative states of gene activity in response to environmental conditions. Cell differentiation, therefore, had its roots in phenotypic plasticity, with the ancient regulatory proteins acquiring new targets over time and evolving into the ``developmental transcription factors” (DTFs) of the ``developmental-genetic toolkit.” In contrast, the emergence of pattern formation and morphogenesis in the Metazoa had a different trajectory. Aggregation of unicellular metazoan ancestors changed the organisms’ spatial scale, leading to the first ``dynamical patterning module” (DPM): cell-cell adhesion. Following this, other DPMs (defined as physical forces and processes pertinent to the scale of the aggregates mobilized by a set of toolkit gene products distinct from the DTFs), transformed simple cell aggregates into hollow, multilayered, segmented, differentiated and additional complex structures, with minimal evolution of constituent genes. Like cell differentiation, therefore, metazoan morphologies also originated from plastic responses of cells and tissues. Here we describe examples of DTFs and most of the important DPMs, discussing their complementary roles in the evolution of developmental mechanisms. We also provide recently characterized examples of DTFs in cell type switching and DPMs in morphogenesis of avian limb bud mesenchyme, an embryo-derived tissue that retains a high degree of developmental plasticity.</p>

				<title>Looking at the origin of phenotypic variation from pattern formation gene networks</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0573-0587</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article critically reviews some widespread views about the overall functioning of development. Special attention is devoted to views in developmental genetics about the superstructure of developmental gene networks. According to these views gene networks are hierarchic and multilayered. The highest layers partition the embryo in large coarse areas and control downstream genes that subsequently subdivide the embryo into smaller and smaller areas. These views are criticized on the bases of developmental and evolutionary arguments. First, these views, although detailed at the level of gene identities, do not incorporate morphogenetic mechanisms nor do they try to explain how morphology changes during development. Often, they assume that morphogenetic mechanisms are subordinate to cell signaling events. This is in contradiction to the evidence reviewed herein. Experimental evidence on pattern formation also contradicts the view that developmental gene networks are hierarchically multilayered and that their functioning is decodable from promoter analysis. Simple evolutionary arguments suggest that, indeed, developmental gene networks tend to be non-hierarchic. Re-use leads to extensive modularity in gene networks while developmental drift blurs this modularity. Evolutionary opportunism makes developmental gene networks very dependent on epigenetic factors.</p>

				<title>Does geometric morphometrics serve the needs of plasticity research?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0589-0599</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of human craniofacial variation exemplifies general problems associated with the analysis of morphological plasticity that owe to the dependence of results on the methods by which phenotypic variation is quantified. We suggest a definition of plasticity that does not subordinate the developmental to the evolutionary: A process model in which changes are not a function of any mean or average, but only of the current state. Geometric morphometrics, a toolkit for assessing and visualizing biological form and its covariates, avoids some of the traditional pitfalls by focusing directly on the analysis of the two- and three-dimensional coordinates of anatomical landmarks. We discuss its potential relevance to phenotypic and developmental plasticity research, as well as some of its limitations, and demonstrate two useful analyses: assessment of asymmetry, and appraisal of integration. We itemize some of our previous studies on causes (inbreeding, environmental circumstances, etc.) and consequences (attractiveness perception) of asymmetry in humans, present some findings relating to the impact of sex on shape, and speculate about the adaptive relevance of one of these processes in particular. A closing argument points out that such considerations are possible only because of the careful separation of assumptions from empirical evidence entailed in the course of this type of data analysis.</p>

				<title>Ageing and cancer as diseases of epigenesis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0601-0604</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cancer and ageing are often said to be diseases of development. During the past fifty years, the genetic components of cancer and ageing have been intensely investigated since development, itself, was seen to be an epiphenomenon of the genome. However, as we have learned more about the expression of the genome, we find that differences in expression can be as important as differences in alleles. It is easier to inactivate a gene by methylation than by mutation, and given that appropriate methylation is essential for normal development, one can immediately see that diseases would result as a consequence of inappropriate epigenetic methylation. While first proposed by Boris Vanyushin in 1973, recent studies have confirmed that inappropriate methylation not only causes diseases, and it also may be the critical factor in ageing and cancers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Immobile plants and immobile modular animals outlive unitary animals. This paper discusses competing but not necessarily mutually exclusive theories to explain this extreme longevity, especially from the perspective of phenotypic plasticity. Stem cell immortality, vascular autonomy, and epicormic branching are some important features of the phenotypic plasticity of plants that contribute to their longevity. Monocarpy versus polycarpy can also influence the kind of senescent processes experienced by plants. How density-dependent phenomena affecting the establishment of juveniles in these immobile organisms can influence the evolution of senescence, and consequently longevity, is reviewed and discussed. Whether climate change scenarios will favour long-lived or short-lived organisms, with their attendant levels of plasticity, is also presented.</p>

				<title>Functional adaptation and phenotypic plasticity at the cellular and whole plant level</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0613-0620</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ability to adaptively alter morphological, anatomical, or physiological functional traits to local environmental variations using external environmental cues is especially well expressed by all terrestrial and most aquatic plants. A ubiquitous cue eliciting these plastic phenotypic responses is mechanical perturbation (MP), which can evoke dramatic differences in the size, shape, or mechanical properties of conspecifics. Current thinking posits that MP is part of a very ancient ``stress-perception response system” that involves receptors located at the cell membrane/cell wall interface capable of responding to a broad spectrum of stress-inducing factors. This hypothesis is explored here from the perspective of cell wall evolution and the control of cell wall architecture by unicellular and multicellular plants. Among the conclusions that emerge from this exploration is the perspective that the plant cell is phenotypically plastic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Drosophila</i> larvae can be trained to avoid odours associated with electric shock. We describe here, an improved method of aversive conditioning and a procedure for decomposing learning retention curve that enables us to do a quantitative analysis of memory phases, short term (STM), middle term (MTM) and long term (LTM) as a function of training cycles. The same method of analysis when applied to learning mutants dunce, amnesiac, rutabaga and radish reveals memory deficits characteristic of the mutant strains.</p>

				<title>Epigenetic learning in non-neural organisms</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0633-0646</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Learning involves a usually adaptive response to an input (an external stimulus or the organism’s own behaviour) in which the input-response relation is memorized; some physical traces of the relation persist and can later be the basis of a more effective response. Using toy models we show that this characterization applies not only to the paradigmatic case of neural learning, but also to cellular responses that are based on epigenetic mechanisms of cell memory. The models suggest that the research agenda of epigenetics needs to be expanded.</p>

				<title>Growth patterns of fossil vertebrates as deduced from bone microstructure: case studies from India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0661-0672</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bone microstructure is affected by ontogeny, phylogeny, biomechanics and environments. These aspects of life history of an extinct animal, especially its growth patterns, may be assessed as fossil bone generally maintains its histological integrity. Recent studies on the bone histology of fossil vertebrates from India encompass different types of temnospondyls and dicynodonts from different Permian and Triassic horizons. The examined taxa show that they had distinct bone histology and varied growth patterns. The Early Triassic trematosaurids had an overall fast growth, which contrasts with that of the Middle and Late Triassic temnospondyl taxa examined. The dicynodonts on the other hand, were characterized by an overall fast growth with periodic interruptions, variable growth rates dependent on ontogeny and indeterminate growth strategy. A comparative study encompassing several neotherapsid genera including the dicynodonts shows significant evolutionary trends towards determinate growth strategy and reduced developmental plasticity.</p>

				<title>The origin and early evolution of whales: macroevolution documented on the Indian Subcontinent</title>

				<page>0673-0686</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The origin of whales (order Cetacea) from a four-footed land animal is one of the best understood examples of macroevolutionary change. This evolutionary transition has been substantially elucidated by fossil finds from the Indian subcontinent in the past decade and a half. Here, we review the first steps of whale evolution, i.e. the transition from a land mammal to obligate marine predators, documented by the Eocene cetacean families of the Indian subcontinent: Pakicetidae, Ambulocetidae, Remingtonocetidae, Protocetidae, and Basilosauridae, as well as their artiodactyl sister group, the Raoellidae. We also discuss the influence that the excellent fossil record has on the study of the evolution of organ systems, in particular the locomotor and hearing systems.</p>

				<title>The Out-of-India hypothesis: What do molecules suggest?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0687-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The remarkable geological and evolutionary history of peninsular India has generated much interest in the patterns and processes that might have shaped the current distributions of its endemic biota. In this regard the ``Out-of-India” hypothesis, which proposes that rafting peninsular India carried Gondwanan forms to Asia after the break-up of Gondwana super continent, has gained prominence. Here we have reviewed molecular studies undertaken on a range of taxa of supposedly Gondwanan origin to better understand the Out-of-India scenario. This re-evaluation of published molecular studies indicates that there is mounting evidence supporting Out-of-India scenario for various Asian taxa. Nevertheless, in many studies the evidence is inconclusive due to lack of information on the age of relevant nodes. Studies also indicate that not all Gondwanan forms of peninsular India dispersed out of India. Many of these ancient lineages are confined to peninsular India and therefore are relict Gondwanan lineages. Additionally, for some taxa an ``Into India” rather than ``Out-of-India” scenario better explains their current distribution. To identify the ``Out-of-India” component of Asian biota it is imperative that we understand the complex biogeographical history of India. To this end, we propose three oversimplified yet explicit phylogenetic predictions. These predictions can be tested through the use of molecular phylogenetic tools in conjunction with palaeontological and geological data.</p>

				<title>Tree ring imprints of long-term changes in climate in western Himalaya, Indi</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0699-0707</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tree-ring analyses from semi-arid to arid regions in western Himalaya show immense potential for developing millennia long climate records. Millennium and longer ring-width chronologies of Himalayan pencil juniper (<i>Juniperus polycarpos</i>), Himalayan pencil cedar (<i>Cedrus deodara</i>) and Chilgoza pine (<i>Pinus gerardiana</i>) have been developed from different sites in western Himalaya. Studies conducted so far on various conifer species indicate strong precipitation signatures in ring-width measurement series. The paucity of weather records from stations close to tree-ring sampling sites poses difficulty in calibrating tree-ring data against climate data especially precipitation for its strong spatial variability in mountain regions. However, for the existence of strong coherence in temperature, even in data from distant stations, more robust temperature reconstructions representing regional and hemispheric signatures have been developed. Tree-ring records from the region indicate multi-century warm and cool anomalies consistent with the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age anomalies.</p>
					<p>Significant relationships noted between mean premonsoon temperature over the western Himalaya and ENSO features endorse utility of climate records from western Himalayan region in understanding long-term climate variability and attribution of anthropogenic impact.</p>

				<title>Deccan volcanism, the KT mass extinction and dinosaurs</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0709-0728</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent advances in Deccan volcanic studies indicate three volcanic phases with the phase-1 at 67.5 Ma followed by a 2 m.y. period of quiescence. Phase-2 marks the main Deccan volcanic eruptions in Chron 29r near the end of the Maastrichtian and accounts for &#8764;80% of the entire 3500 m thick Deccan lava pile. At least four of the world’s longest lava flows spanning 1000 km across India and out into the Gulf of Bengal mark phase-2. The final phase-3 was smaller, coincided with the early Danian Chron 29n and also witnessed several of the longest lava flows.</p>
					<p>The KT boundary and mass extinction was first discovered based on planktic foraminifera from shallow marine intertrappean sediments exposed in Rajahmundry quarries between the longest lava flows of the main volcanic phase-2 and smaller phase-3. At this locality early Danian (zone P1a) planktic foraminiferal assemblages directly overlie the top of phase-2 eruptions and indicate that the masse extinction coincided with the end of this volcanic phase. Planktic foraminiferal assemblages also mark the KT boundary in intertrappean sediments at Jhilmili, Chhindwara, where freshwater to estuarine conditions prevailed during the early Danian and indicate the presence of a marine seaway across India at KT time.</p>
					<p>Dinosaur bones, nesting sites with complete eggs and abundant eggshells are known from central India surrounding the hypothesized seaway through the Narmada-Tapti rift zone. A Maastrichtian age is generally assigned to these dinosaur remains. Age control may now be improved based on marine microfossils from sequences deposited in the seaway and correlating these strata to nearby terrestrial sequences with dinosaur remains.</p>

				<title>India at the cross-roads of human evolution</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0729-0747</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian palaeoanthropological record, although patchy at the moment, is improving rapidly with every new find. This broad review attempts to provide an account of</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the Late Miocene fossil apes and their gradual disappearance due to ecological shift from forest dominated to grassland dominated ecosystem around 9–8 Ma ago,</li>
						<li>the Pliocene immigration/evolution of possible hominids and associated fauna,</li>
						<li>the Pleistocene record of fossil hominins, associated fauna and artifacts, and</li>
						<li>the Holocene time of permanent settlements and the genetic data from various human cultural groups within India.</li>
					</ul> 
					<p>Around 13 Ma ago (late Middle Miocene) Siwalik forests saw the emergence of an orangutan-like primate <i>Sivapithecus</i>. By 8 Ma, this genus disappeared from the Siwalik region as its habitat started shrinking due to increased aridity influenced by global cooling and monsoon intensification. A contemporary and a close relative of Sivapithecus, <i>Gigantopithecus</i> (<i>Indopithecus</i>), the largest ape that ever-lived, made its first appearance at around 9 Ma. Other smaller primates that were pene-contemporaneous with these apes were <i>Pliopithecus</i> (<i>Dendropithecus</i>), <i>Indraloris, Sivaladapis</i> and <i>Palaeotupia</i>. The Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene witnessed northern hemisphere glaciations, followed by the spread of arid conditions on a global scale, setting the stage for hominids to explore ``Savanahastan”. With the prominent expansion of grassland environments from East Africa to China and Indonesia in the Pliocene, monkeys and baboons dispersed into the Indian subcontinent from Africa along with other mammals. Though debated, there are several claims of the presence of early hominins in this part of the world during the Late Pliocene, based primarily on the recovery of Palaeolithic tools. Fossils of our own ancestor and one of the first globe-trotters, early <i>Homo erectus</i>, has been documented from the Early Pleistocene of East Africa, Western Asia and Southeast Asia, thus indirectly pointing towards Indian subcontinent as a possible migration corridor between these regions. The only definite pre-<i>Homo sapiens</i> fossil hominin remains come from the Central Narmada Valley and are thought to be of Middle to late Pleistocene age, and the cranium has been shown to be closely linked to archaic <i>Homo sapiens/H. heidelbergensis</i> of Europe. Around &#8764;74,000 yrs ago, a super volcanic eruption in Sumatra caused the deposition of Youngest Toba Tephra, that covered large parts of the Indian peninsula. Just around this time anatomically-and-behaviorally modern humans or <i>Homo sapiens</i> possibly arrived into India as evidenced by the so called Middle and Upper Palaeolithic assemblages and associated symbolic evidence. The available genetic data reveals that the gene pool to which modern Indians races belong was extremely diverse and had variable mixed links with both European and Asian populations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Deep-sea benthic foraminifera, planktic foraminifer <i>Globigerina bulloides</i> and pteropods have been quantitatively analysed in 451 samples from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 716A, to understand both surface and deep-sea palaeoceanographic changes in the equatorial Indian Ocean basin during the late Quaternary (&#8764;444–151 Kyrs). Benthic foraminifera were analysed from &#62; 125 𝜇m size fraction whereas <i>Globigerina bulloides</i> and pteropods were analysed from &#62; 150 𝜇m size fraction. Factor analysis of most dominant benthic foraminiferal species over the studied time span made it possible to identify three biofacies characterizing distinct deep-sea environmental settings at Hole 716A. The environmental interpretation of each species is based on the ecology of recent deep-sea benthic foraminifera. The faunal record indicates fluctuating deep-sea conditions including changes in surface productivity, organic food supply and deep-sea oxygenation linked to changing wind intensities. These changes are pronounced on glacial-interglacial time scales driven by summer monsoon winds.</p>

				<page>0765-0776</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The discovery of Precambrian microfossils in 1954 opened a new vista of investigations in the field of evolution of life. Although the Precambrian encompasses 87% of the earth’s history, the pace of organismal evolution was quite slow. The life forms as categorised today in the three principal domains viz. the Bacteria, the Archaea and the Eucarya evolved during this period. In this paper, we review the advancements made in the Precambrian palaeontology and its contribution in understanding the evolution of life forms on earth. These studies have enriched the data base on the Precambrian life. Most of the direct evidence includes fossil prokaryotes, protists, advanced algal fossils, acritarchs, and the indirect evidence is represented by the stromatolites, trace fossils and geochemical fossils signatures. The Precambrian fossils are preserved in the form of compressions, impressions, and permineralized and biomineralized remains.</p>

				<title>Evidence of Late Palaeocene-Early Eocene equatorial rain forest refugia in southern Western Ghats, India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0777-0797</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Equatorial rain forests that maintain a balance between speciation and extinction are hot-spots for studies of biodiversity. Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area. We attempted to track the affinities of the pollen flora of the endemic plants of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene (&#8764;55–50 Ma) sedimentary deposits of western and northeastern Indian region. The study shows striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxa of the early Palaeogene. Widespread occurrences of coal and lignite deposits during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying areas all along the western and northeastern margins of the Indian subcontinent. Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period has been seen as a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent, superimposed by a long term global warming phase (PETM and EECO) during the early Palaeogene. The study presents clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene times, are now restricted in a small area as a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area. High precipitation and shorter periods of dry months seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineages of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic changes subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent times.</p>

				<title>Biomechanical aspects of bone microstructure in vertebrates: potential approach to palaeontological investigations</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0799-0809</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biomechanical or biophysical principles can be applied to study biological structures in their modern or fossil form. Bone is an important tissue in paleontological studies as it is a commonly preserved element in most fossil vertebrates, and can often allow its microstructures such as lacuna and canaliculi to be studied in detail. In this context, the principles of Fluid Mechanics and Scaling Laws have been previously applied to enhance the understanding of bone microarchitecture and their implications for the evolution of hydraulic structures to transport fluid. It has been shown that the microstructure of bone has evolved to maintain efficient transport between the nutrient supply and cells, the living components of the tissue. Application of the principle of minimal expenditure of energy to this analysis shows that the path distance comprising five or six lamellar regions represents an effective limit for fluid and solute transport between the nutrient supply and cells; beyond this threshold, hydraulic resistance in the network increases and additional energy expenditure is necessary for further transportation. This suggests an optimization of the size of the bone’s building blocks (such as osteon or trabecular thickness) to meet the metabolic demand concomitant to minimal expenditure of energy. This biomechanical aspect of bone microstructure is corroborated from the ratio of osteon to Haversian canal diameters and scaling constants of several mammals considered in this study. This aspect of vertebrate bone microstructure and physiology may provide a basis of understanding of the form and function relationship in both extinct and extant taxa.</p>

				<page>0811-0823</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sedimentary beds associated with Deccan Continental Flood Basalt (DCFB) sequences exposed in the volcanic subprovinces of Jabalpur-Mandla-Chhindwara (JMC) regions of Madhya Pradesh and Nand-Dongargaon (N-D) basin and the adjoining areas to the west in Yeotmal-Nanded in Maharashtra were studied for their palynofloral analysis. The sediments were characterized palynologically and changes in the palynoflora are observed at different stratigraphic levels in a number of sections including several new intertrappean localities recorded in recent years. For the purpose of effective correlation of different subprovinces, palynofloras of some of the previously studied intertrappeans are also reviewed. Our studies suggest that before the start of the Deccan volcanic activity, the palynoflora found in the Lameta sediments, was dominated by gymnosperms-angiosperm association. The plant canopy consisted mainly of gymnosperms (Conifers and Podocarpaceae) whereas, the understory members were mostly of palms and herbs (Poaceae and Asteraceae). The eruption of Deccan volcanic flows severely affected the existing floral association and proved fatal for the well established plant community. The immediately overlying sediments associated with the earliest volcanic flows are dominated by pteridophytes and angiosperm taxa (<i>Azolla cretacea, Aquilapollenites bengalensis, Ariadnaesporites</i> sp., <i>Gabonisporis vigourouxii</i> and <i>Triporoletes reticulatus</i>). Higher up in the stratigraphic sequence, similar forms continued with simultaneous appearance of new taxa including <i>Scabrastephanocolpites</i> spp. At still higher stratigraphic levels, abundance of fungi especially the mycorrhizal fungi, concurrent with sharp decline in pollen/spore recovery was observed. In the culminating phase (i.e. Palaeocene) of Deccan volcanic history a new palynofloral assemblage of typical Palaeocene taxa (<i>Dandotiaspora dilata, D. pseudoauriculata, D. plicata, Spinizonocolpites echinatus, Matanomadhiasulcites</i> sp., and <i>Lakiapollis ovatus</i>) was encountered.</p>

				<title>Understanding complex systems: lessons from Auzoux's and von Hagens's anatomical models</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0835-0843</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Animal and human anatomy is among the most complex systems known, and suitable teaching methods have been of great importance in the progress of knowledge. Examining the human body is part of the process by which medical students come to understand living forms. However, the need to preserve cadavers has led to the development of various techniques to manufacture models for teaching purposes. A variety of materials, such as wax, wood, <i>papier-mâché</i>, or glass, have long been used to construct animal and plant models. In the case of the human body, the most innovative, yet controversial, method of preservation has been plastination, invented by the German physician Gunther von Hagens, by which actual human bodies are preserved as odourless and aesthetic models for teaching and exhibitions. We point out in our study that the ‘hands-on’ approach that some anatomical models allow, namely, the (clastic) disassembly and reassembly of the parts of complex systems and their models, is not only a crucial tool for learning, but is far superior to the simple passive observation that rigid, single-piece models allow. And what is valid for the learning of anatomy can be generalized to the acquisition of knowledge of other complex physical systems.</p>

				<page>0849-0852</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In an attempt to see if frog blood vessels possess a plasma membrane electron transport system, the postcaval vein and aorta isolated from <i>Rana tigrina</i> were tested for their ability to reduce ferricyanide, methylene blue, and 2,6-dichloroindophenol. While the dyes remained unchanged, ferricyanide was reduced to ferrocyanide. This reduction was resistant to inhibition by cyanide and azide. Heptane extraction or formalin fixation of the tissues markedly reduced the capability to reduce ferricyanide. Denuded aortas retained only 30% of the activity of intact tissue. Our results indicate that the amphibian postcaval vein and aorta exhibit plasma membrane electron transport</p>

				<title>A weak link in metabolism: the metabolic capacity for glycine biosynthesis does not satisfy the need for collagen synthesis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0853-0872</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a previous paper, we pointed out that the capability to synthesize glycine from serine is constrained by the stoichiometry of the glycine hydroxymethyltransferase reaction, which limits the amount of glycine produced to be no more than equimolar with the amount of C<sub>1</sub> units produced. This constraint predicts a shortage of available glycine if there are no adequate compensating processes. Here, we test this prediction by comparing all reported fluxes for the production and consumption of glycine in a human adult. Detailed assessment of all possible sources of glycine shows that synthesis from serine accounts for more than 85% of the total, and that the amount of glycine available from synthesis, about 3 g/day, together with that available from the diet, in the range 1.5–3.0 g/day, may fall significantly short of the amount needed for all metabolic uses, including collagen synthesis by about 10 g per day for a 70 kg human. This result supports earlier suggestions in the literature that glycine is a semi-essential amino acid and that it should be taken as a nutritional supplement to guarantee a healthy metabolism.</p>

				<title>Porous poly (L-lactic acid) scaffolds are optimal substrates for internal colonization by A6 mesoangioblasts and immunocytochemical analyses</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0873-0879</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, mouse mesoangioblasts were seeded onto bidimensional matrices within three-dimensional porous scaffolds of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA), in the presence or absence of a type I collagen coating. The cells were observed under a scanning electron microscope and tested for their adhesion, survival and proliferation. Immunolocalization of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70, an abundant and ubiquitous intracellular protein in these cells, was also performed in sectioned cell-containing scaffolds under a confocal fluorescence microscope to determine if in situ analysis of intracellular constituents was feasible. The data show that PLLA films allow direct cell adhesion and represent an optimal support for cell growth, and that the internal surfaces of PLLA polymeric sponges can be colonized by mesoangioblasts, which can be submitted for <i>in situ</i> confocal microscopic analyses for possible monitoring of timedependent expression of differentiation markers.</p>

				<title>Xylose reductase from the thermophilic fungus <i>Talaromyces emersonii</i>: cloning and heterologous expression of the native gene (<i>Texr</i>) and a double mutant (<i>Texr</i><sup>K271R+N273D</sup>) with altered coenzyme specificity</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Xylose reductase is involved in the first step of the fungal pentose catabolic pathway. The gene encoding xylose reductase (<i>Texr</i>) was isolated from the thermophilic fungus <i>Talaromyces emersonii</i>, expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and purified to homogeneity. <i>Texr</i> encodes a 320 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 36 kDa, which exhibited high sequence identity with other xylose reductase sequences and was shown to be a member of the aldoketoreductase (AKR) superfamily with a preference for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as coenzyme. Given the potential application of xylose reductase enzymes that preferentially utilize the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) rather than NADPH in the fermentation of five carbon sugars by genetically engineered microorganisms, the coenzyme selectivity of <i>Te</i>XR was altered by site-directed mutagenesis. The <i>Te</i>XR<sup>K271R+N273D</sup> double mutant displayed an altered coenzyme preference with a 16-fold improvement in NADH utilization relative to the wild type and therefore has the potential to reduce redox imbalance of xylose fermentation in recombinant <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains. Expression of <i>Texr</i> was shown to be inducible by the same carbon sources responsible for the induction of genes encoding enzymes relevant to lignocellulose hydrolysis, suggesting a coordinated expression of intracellular and extracellular enzymes relevant to hydrolysis and metabolism of pentose sugars in <i>T. emersonii</i> in adaptation to its natural habitat. This indicates a potential advantage in survival and response to a nutrient-poor environment.</p>

				<title>Pharmacological effects of two cytolysins isolated from the sea anemone <i>Stichodactyla helianthus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0891-0898</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sticholysins I and II (St I/II) are cytolysins purified from the sea anemone <i>Stichodactyla helianthus</i>. In this study, we show their pharmacological action on guinea-pig and snail models in native and pH-denatured conditions in order to correlate the pharmacological findings with the pore-forming activity of both isoforms. In guinea-pig erythrocytes (𝑁 = 3), St II possessed higher haemolytic activity in comparison with St I and this activity was lost at an alkaline pH. In molluscan central neurons (𝑁 = 30), they irreversibly decreased the amplitude of the cholinergic response; St I (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.6 𝜇molL<sup>–1</sup>) was more potent than St II (EC<sub>50</sub> &#62; 6.6 𝜇molL<sup>–1</sup>) and they both increased the duration of the action potential; these effects were absent at an alkaline pH. In guinea-pig isolated atrium (𝑁 = 25), both increased the amplitude of the contraction force, but St II was more potent than St I (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.03 𝜇molL<sup>–1</sup> and 0.3 𝜇molL<sup>–1</sup>, respectively) and this effect persisted at an alkaline pH. In summary, both cytolysins have neuroactive and cardioactive properties. The main mechanism in molluscan neurons seems to be associated with the cytolytic activity of these molecules, whereas in guinea-pig atrium, the existence of an additional pharmacological mechanism might be contributing to the observed effect.</p>

				<title>Proteomic analysis of heparin-binding proteins from human seminal plasma: a step towards identification of molecular markers of male fertility</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0899-0908</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glycosaminoglycans, especially heparin, are involved in various cell processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle control, platelet activation, capacitation, acrosome reaction and sperm decondensation. Heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) are essential constituents of human seminal fluid, which bind to sperm lipids containing the phosphorylcholine group and mediate the fertilization process. We utilized a proteomic set-up consisting of affinity chromatography, isoelectric focusing (IEF) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/MS) for protein analysis of human HBPs. We resolved 70 different spots on two-dimensional (2-D) gel and subsequently identified these proteins. Forty different types of proteins were identified. Functional analysis revealed that 38% of the proteins belonged to the enzyme category, 20% were involved in RNA processing and transcription, 18% in structure and transport function, and 16% in cell recognition and signal transduction. We also identified 8% of proteins with unknown functions, although their expression in seminal fluid has been documented. Proteins of seminal fluid that bind heparin may be directly involved in sperm capacitation and acrosome reaction (AR), which are the two critical steps for fertilization. This information on HBPs would be useful for identifying potential biomarkers of fertility in the near future.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A number of therapeutic options are available for patients with prostate carcinoma till the time that the tumour is hormone dependent. However, no fully effective therapy is available for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate carcinomas. Antibodies directed at epitopes unique to or overexpressed on the cancer cells could be of therapeutic utility. A monoclonal antibody (Moab) 2C4 has been generated, which binds with cells of two androgenindependent prostate cancers, DU145 and PC3, and does not bind to peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of healthy donors. This antibody, along with the previously developed Moab 730, kills 100% of both DU145 and PC3 cells in the presence of complement and does not have a deleterious effect on PBLs of healthy males. The anti-tumour action of the two antibodies prevents the establishment of DU145 cell tumour in nude mice in vivo. Moab 2C4 in combination with 730 has potential for use as therapy for androgen-independent cancers.</p>

				<title>Plasma proteome analysis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical squamous cell carcinoma</title>

				<page>0917-0925</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although cervical cancer is preventable with early detection, it remains the second most common malignancy among women. An understanding of how proteins change in their expression during a particular diseased state such as cervical cancer will contribute to an understanding of how the disease develops and progresses. Potentially, it may also lead to the ability to predict the occurrence of the disease. With this in mind, we aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of cervical cancer patients. Plasma from control, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) stage IV subjects was resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the resulting proteome profiles compared. Differentially expressed protein spots were then identified by mass spectrometry. Eighteen proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the plasma of CIN 3 and SCC stage IV samples when compared with that of controls. Competitive ELISA further validated the expression of cytokeratin 19 and tetranectin. Functional analyses of these differentially expressed proteins will provide further insight into their potential role(s) in cervical cancer-specific monitoring and therapeutics.</p>

				<title>Expression of HSP27, HSP72 and MRP proteins in <i>in vitro</i> co-culture of colon tumour cell spheroids with normal cells after incubation with rhTGF-𝛽1 and/or CPT-11</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0927-0940</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We studied the expression of inducible heat shock protein (HSP27, HSP72) and multidrug-resistance protein (MRP) in co-cultures of human colon carcinoma cell spheroids obtained from different grades of tumour with normal human colon epithelium, myofibroblast and endothelial cell monolayers. We also measured the influence of recombinant human transforming growth factor 𝛽1 (rhTGF-𝛽1) and camptothecin (CPT-11), added as single agents or in combination, on the levels of the HSPs, MRP, interleukin (IL)-6 and nitric oxide (NO).</p>
					<p>An immunoblotting analysis with densitometry showed that rhTGF-𝛽1 and/or CPT-11 increased HSP27, HSP72 and MRP expression in tumour cells and myofibroblasts, as well as in co-cultures compared with appropriate controls. By contrast, in colonic epithelium, inhibition of HSPs and MRP was comparable with that of the control. In endothelial cells, HSP72 was undetectable.</p>
					<p>Direct interaction of colon tumour spheroids with normal myofibroblasts caused a significant, tumour-grade dependent increase in IL-6 production. Production of IL-6 was significantly lowered by rhTGF-𝛽1 and/or CPT-11. Tumour cell spheroids cultivated alone produced larger amounts of NO than normal cells. In co-culture, the level of the radical decreased compared with the sum of NO produced by the monocultures of the two types of cells. rhTGF-𝛽1 and/or CPT-11 decreased NO production both in tumour and normal cell monocultures and their co-cultures. In conclusion, direct interactions between tumour and normal cells influence the expression of HSP27, HSP72 and MRP, and alter IL-6 and NO production. rhTGF-𝛽1 and/or CPT-11 may potentate resistance to chemotherapy by increasing HSP and MRP expression but, on the other hand, they may limit tumour cell spread by decreasing the level of some soluble mediators of inflammation (IL-6 and NO).</p>

				<title>Identification and expression profile of <i>GbAGL2</i>, a C-class gene from <i>Gossypium barbadense</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0941-0951</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An <i>AGAMOUS</i> (<i>AG</i>)-like gene, <i>GbAGL2</i>, was isolated from <i>Gossypium barbadense</i> and characterized. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>GbAGL2</i> shared high homology with AG-subfamily genes and belonged to a C-class gene family. DNA gel blot analysis showed that <i>GbAGL2</i> belonged to a low-copy gene family. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed that <i>GbAGL2</i> was highly expressed in reproductive tissues including ovules and carpels, but barely expressed in vegetative tissues. In addition, <i>GbAGL2</i> expression in a cotton cultivar XuZhou142 (wt) (XZ142, <i>G. hirsutum</i> L.) and its fibreless mutant XZ142 (fl) was examined. RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization analysis indicated that <i>GbAGL2</i> transcripts were preferentially restricted to outer ovule integuments, carpels and fibres. These expression patterns implied that <i>GbAGL2</i> might participate in the development of the carpel and ovule. Furthermore, <i>Arabidopsis</i> transformation was performed and modifications occurred in flowers, and the silique length of transgenic plants also increased slightly, suggesting that the <i>GbAGL2</i> gene may have a positive effect on the development of the ovary or ovule. Our findings suggest that <i>GbAGL2</i> might not only specify the identity of floral organs but also play a potential key role in ovary or fibre development in cotton.</p>

				<title>Analysis of promoter activity in transgenic plants by normalizing expression with a reference gene: anomalies due to the influence of the test promoter on the reference promoter</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0953-0962</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variations in transgene expression due to position effect and copy number are normalized when analysing and comparing the strengths of different promoters. In such experiments, the promoter to be tested is placed upstream to a reporter gene and a second expression cassette is introduced in a linked fashion in the same transfer DNA (T-DNA). Normalization in the activity of the test promoter is carried out by calculating the ratio of activities of the test and reference promoters. When an appropriate number of independent transgenic events are analysed, normalization facilitates assessment of the relative strengths of the test promoters being compared. In this study, using different modified versions of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter expressing the reporter gene 𝛽-<i>glucuronidase</i> (<i>gus</i>) (test cassette) linked to a <i>chloramphenicol acetyl transferase</i> (<i>cat</i>) gene under the wild-type 35S promoter (reference cassette) in transgenic tobacco lines, we observed that <i>cat</i> gene expression varied depending upon the strength of the modified 35S promoter expressing the <i>gus</i> gene. The 35S promoter in the reference cassette was found to have been upregulated in cases where the modified 35S promoter was weaker than the wild-type 35S promoter. Many studies have been carried out in different organisms to study the phenomenon of transcriptional interference, which refers to the reduced expression of the downstream promoter by a closely linked upstream promoter. However, we observed a positive interaction wherein the weakened activity of a promoter led to upregulation of a contiguous promoter. These observations suggest that, in situations where the promoters of the test and reference gene share the same transcription factors, the activity of the test promoter can influence the activity of the reference promoter in a way that the test promoter’s strength is underestimated when normalized by the reference promoter.</p>

				<title>The co-optimization of floral display and nectar reward</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0963-0967</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In most insect-pollinated flowers, pollinators cannot detect the presence of nectar without entering the flower. Therefore, flowers may cheat by not producing nectar and may still get pollinated. Earlier studies supported this ‘cheater flower’ hypothesis and suggested that the cost saving by cheater flowers could be the most predominant selective force in the evolution of nectarless flowers. Previous models as well as empirical studies have addressed the problem of optimizing the proportion of nectarless and nectarful flowers. However, there has been no attempt to optimize the investment in nectar production along with that in floral display. One of the key questions that arises is whether the floral display will evolve to be an honest indicator of nectar reward. We use a mathematical model to cooptimize the investments in nectar and floral display in order to achieve maximum reproductive success. The model assumes that pollinators rely on a relative rather than an absolute judgement of reward. A conspicuous floral display attracts naïve pollinators on the one hand and enhances pollinator learning on the other. We show that under these assumptions, plant–pollinator co-evolution leads to honest signalling, i.e. a positive correlation between display and reward.</p>

				<title>Correlations between soil microbial and physicochemical variations in a rice paddy: implications for assessing soil health</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0969-0976</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that spatial variations in soil microbial variables in a Thai rice paddy are accurately described by multivariate profiles of the soil bacterial communities. We found that community-level physiological profiles of soil bacterial communities could better describe the population density of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> in soil than the physicochemical profiles do. However, soil dehydrogenase levels were closely correlated with soil fertility (𝑃 &#60; 0.05), and these were better described by the physicochemical profiles. Hence, the hypothesis was rejected, and we suspect that soil microbial variables react differently to the same physicochemical changes. The average population density of <i>R. solani</i> (35 colony-forming units/g dry soil) was relatively high in the soil we studied, and the soil fertility was found to be among the poorest in Thailand. The soil quality was comparable to the most degraded bare ground soil in an adjacent bioreserve in terms of Shannon diversity index based on the community-level physiological profile as well as values of soil fertility indices. Overall, the soil microbial and physicochemical indicators showed that the paddy soil needs to be supplemented with soil nutrients. Otherwise, <i>R. solani</i> may cause a significant reduction in rice production.</p>

				<title>Sex expression and breeding strategy in <i>Commelina benghalensis</i> L.</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0977-0990</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the results of a series of experiments conducted to unravel the patterns of sex expression and reproductive output in a fascinating species with high variation in sexuality. <i>Commelina benghalensis L</i>., an andromonoecious rainy season weed, bears male and bisexual flowers in axillary spathes of all the plants investigated. Bisexual flowers are of two types; chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL). The former are borne on subaerial and the latter on subterranean shoots, in addition to those on aerial spathes. Three populations of the species, designated JU1, JU2 and JU3, were scanned for three consecutive years from 1996 to 1998, and the number and distribution of male, CH and CL flowers per plant were found to vary. The mere number of CH/CL flowers per plant is by itself not an accurate measure of mixed mating. It is necessary to confirm that CH flowers actually outcross and, if they do so, to what extent. Comparison of the pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio and percentage pollen germination on the stigmas of the CH and CL flowers have been used as indices of the pollination system. Confirmation of this was sought from the fruit and seed sets obtained after manual pollination of emasculated flowers with self- and cross-pollen. Results so obtained were compared with those of natural pollination. In the majority of CH flowers, the male and female reproductive phases (i.e. anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity) overlap, providing for self-pollination. However, two exceptions to this general behaviour were found in some plants of all the three populations. In some CH flowers, the female phase matures prior to anther dehiscence while in others, the anthers are sterile. Such plants, designated as variants 1 and 2, respectively, facilitate cross-pollination. While the CL flowers contribute to the production of selfed progeny, the variants of CH ones permit formation of outcrossed progeny, indicating a mixed mating strategy in <i>C. benghalensis</i>.</p>

				<title>Nanovaccines: recent developments in vaccination</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0995-1003</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the past 100 years, vaccination has contributed immensely to public health by preventing a number of infectious diseases. Attenuated, killed or part of the microorganism is employed to stimulate the immune system against it. Progress in biotechnology has provided protective immunity through DNA vaccines. In recent years, nanovaccine is a novel approach to the methodology of vaccination. Nanomaterials are delivered in the form of microspheres, nanobeads or micro-nanoprojections. Painless, effective and safe needle-free routes such as the intranasal or the oral route, or patches of microprojections to the skin are some of the approaches which are in the experimental stage at present but may have a great future ahead in nanovaccination.</p>

				<title>A futile cycle, formed between two ATP-dependant 𝛾-glutamyl cycle enzymes, 𝛾-glutamyl cysteine synthetase and 5-oxoprolinase: the cause of cellular ATP depletion in nephrotic cystinosis?</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0021-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cystinosis, an inherited disease caused by a defect in the lysosomal cystine transporter (CTNS), is characterized by renal proximal tubular dysfunction. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion appears to be a key event in the pathophysiology of the disease, even though the manner in which ATP depletion occurs is still a puzzle. We present a model that explains how a futile cycle that is generated between two ATP-utilizing enzymes of the 𝛾-glutamyl cycle leads to ATP depletion. The enzyme 𝛾-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (𝛾-GCS), in the absence of cysteine, forms 5-oxoproline (instead of the normal substrate, 𝛾-glutamyl cysteine) and the 5-oxoproline is converted into glutamate by the ATP-dependant enzyme, 5-oxoprolinase. Thus, in cysteine-limiting conditions, glutamate is cycled back into glutamate via 5-oxoproline at the cost of two ATP molecules without production of glutathione and is the cause of the decreased levels of glutathione synthesis, as well as the ATP depletion observed in these cells. The model is also compatible with the differences seen in the human patients and the mouse model of cystinosis, where renal failure is not observed.</p>

				<title>The evolutionary history of testicular externalization and the origin of the scrotum</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0027-0037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper re-examines the evolution of the scrotum and testicular descent in the context of the recent phylogeny of mammals. The adaptive significance of testicular descent and scrotality is briefly discussed. We mapped four character states reflecting the position of testes and presence of scrotum onto recent mammalian phylogeny. Our results are interpreted as follows: as to the presence of testicondy in Monotremata and most of Atlantogenata, which represent the basal group of all eutherians, we argue that primary testicondy represents a plesiomorphic condition for Eutheria as well as for all mammals. This is in opposition to the previous hypothesis of Werdelin and Nilsonne that the scrotum may have evolved before the origin of mammals and then repeatedly disappeared in many groups including monotremes. We suggest that the scrotum evolved at least twice during the evolutionary history of mammals, within Marsupialia and Boreoeutheria, and has subsequently been lost by many groups; this trend is especially strong in Laurasiatheria. We suggest that the recent diversity in testicular position within mammals is the result of multiple selection pressures stemming from the need to provide conditions suitable for sperm development and storage, or to protect the male gonads from excessive physical and physiological disturbance.</p>

				<title>Transgene transmission in South American catfish (<i>Rhamdia quelen</i>) larvae by sperm-mediated gene transfer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0039-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The silver catfish (<i>Rhamdia quelen</i>) is an endemic American fish species. The sperm of each species has its own peculiarities and biological characteristics, which influence the success of mass DNA transfer methods. Our objective in this study was to evaluate different sperm-mediated gene transfer (SMGT) methods to obtain transgenic silver catfish. Different treatments for the incorporation of a foreign pEGFP plasmid group were used: (1) dehydrated/rehydrated (DR), (2) dehydrated/rehydrated/electroporated (DRE), (3) electroporated (E), (4) incubated with seminal plasma (INC); and (5) incubated in the absence of seminal plasma (INCSP). Sperm motility, time of activity duration (TAD), fertilization rate (FR), hatching rate (HR) and sperm morphology were also evaluated. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity rates for the presence of the transgene were: DRE 60%; DR 40%; E 25%; INC 5% and INCSP 25%. The rates of embryo EGFP expression were: DRE 63%; DR 44%; E 34%; INC 8% and INCSP 38%. The fertilization rate in the control and DRE treatments groups were higher than in the DR group, but the E, INC and INCSP treatment groups had the lowest rate. The hatching rates of the DRE, DR and control groups were higher than in the INCSP, INC and E treatment groups (𝑃 &#62; 0.05). There were no differences among the DRE and DR, E and DR, E and INCSP groups in expression and PCR positivity rates of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in embryos. Scanning electron microscopy also did not show any change in sperm morphology among treatment groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on transgene transmission of exogenous DNA into silver catfish larvae through SMGT technology</p>

				<title>Proteome analysis of soybean roots under waterlogging stress at an early vegetative stage</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0049-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To gain better insight into how soybean roots respond to waterlogging stress, we carried out proteomic profiling combined with physiological analysis at two time points for soybean seedlings in their early vegetative stage. Seedlings at the V2 stage were subjected to 3 and 7 days of waterlogging treatments. Waterlogging stress resulted in a gradual increase of lipid peroxidation and <i>in vivo</i> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level in roots. Total proteins were extracted from root samples and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). A total of 24 reproducibly resolved, differentially expressed protein spots visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry or electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis. Of these, 14 proteins were upregulated; 5 proteins were decreased; and 5 were newly induced in waterlogged roots. The identified proteins include well-known classical anaerobically induced proteins as well as novel waterlogging-responsive proteins that were not known previously as being waterlogging responsive. The novel proteins are involved in several processes, i.e. signal transduction, programmed cell death, RNA processing, redox homeostasis and metabolisms of energy. An increase in abundance of several typical anaerobically induced proteins, such as glycolysis and fermentation pathway enzymes, suggests that plants meet energy requirement via the fermentation pathway due to lack of oxygen. Additionally, the impact of waterlogging on the several programmed cell death- and signal transduction-related proteins suggest that they have a role to play during stress. RNA gel blot analysis for three programmed cell death-related genes also revealed a differential mRNA level but did not correlate well with the protein level. These results demonstrate that the soybean plant can cope with waterlogging through the management of carbohydrate consumption and by regulating programmed cell death. The identification of novel proteins such as a translation initiation factor, apyrase, auxin-amidohydrolase and coproporphyrinogen oxidase in response to waterlogging stress may provide new insight into the molecular basis of the waterlogging-stress response of soybean.</p>

				<title>Neonatal intramuscular injection of plasmid encoding glucagon-like peptide-1 affects anxiety behaviour and expression of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor in adolescent rats</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Early-life endocrine intervention may programme hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and cause psychiatric disorders in later life. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been implicated in the regulation of neuroendocrine and behavioural responses, but it is yet to be determined whether and how neonatal GLP-1 overexpression may modify hippocampal GR expression and thus programme adolescent behaviour in rats. Two-dayold pups were injected intramuscularly with vacant plasmid (VP) or plasmid DNA encoding secretory GLP-1 (GP). Anxiety-related behaviour was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test at 8 weeks of age. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured with enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Protein and mRNA levels were determined by western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. The DNA methylation status of the GR exon 1<sub>7</sub> promoter was determined by bisulphate sequencing PCR (BSP). GP rats exhibited anxiolytic behaviour compared with their VP counterparts. Hippocampal GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and GR mRNA expression were significantly elevated in GP rats without a significant difference in plasma corticosterone. Significant reduction in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression was observed in GP rats disconnected with alterations in DNA methylation of the GR exon 1<sub>7</sub> promoter. Nevertheless, mRNA expression of nerve growth factor-inducible protein A (NGFI-A) was significantly elevated in GP rats. These results suggest that neonatal intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA encoding GLP-1 affects anxiety behaviour in adolescent rats, probably through NGFI-A-activated upregulation of hippocampal GR expression.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Wolbachia</i> are symbiotic endobacteria that infect the majority of filarial nematodes, including <i>Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi</i> and <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i>. Recent studies have suggested that <i>Wolbachia</i> are necessary for the reproduction and survival of filarial nematodes and have highlighted the use of antibiotic therapy such as tetracycline/doxycycline as a novel method of treatment for infections caused by these organisms. Before such therapy is conceived and implemented on a large scale, it is necessary to assess the prevalence of the endosymbiont in <i>W. bancrofti</i> from different geographical locations. We present data from molecular and electron microscopic studies to provide evidence for <i>Wolbachia</i> symbiosis in <i>W. bancrofti</i> microfilariae collected from two districts (Bankura and Birbhum) of West Bengal, India.</p>

				<title>Evidence of a humoral immune response against the prokaryotic expressed N-terminal autoprotease (N<sup>pro</sup>) protein of bovine viral diarrhoea virus</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0079-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is an economically important pathogen of cattle and sheep belonging to the genus <i>Pestivirus</i> of the family Flaviviridae. Although the BVDV non-structural N-terminal protease (N<sup>pro</sup>) acts as an interferon antagonist and subverts the host innate immunity, little is known about its immunogenicity. Hence, we expressed a recombinant BVDV N<sup>pro</sup>–His fusion protein (28 kDa) in <i>E. coli</i> and determined the humoral immune response generated by it in rabbits. The antigenicity of the N<sup>pro</sup> protein was confirmed by western blot using anti-BVDV hyperimmune cattle, sheep and goat serum, and anti-N<sup>pro</sup> rabbit serum. When rabbits were immunized with the N<sup>pro</sup> protein, a humoral immune response was evident by 4 weeks and persisted till 10 weeks post immunization as detected by ELISA and western blot. Despite N<sup>pro</sup>-specific antibodies remaining undetectable in 80 serum samples from BVDV-infected sheep and goats, BVDV hyperimmune sera along with some of the field cattle, sheep and goat sera with high BVDV neutralizing antibody titres were found positive for N<sup>pro</sup> antibodies. Our results provide evidence that despite the low immunogenicity of the BVDV N<sup>pro</sup> protein, a humoral immune response is induced in cattle, sheep and goats only with repeated BVDV exposure.</p>

				<title>Monoclonal antibodies AC-43 and AC-29 disrupt <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> development in the Indian malaria vector <i>Anopheles culicifacies</i> (Diptera: culicidae)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0087-0094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A repertoire of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was generated against the midgut proteins of <i>Anopheles culicifacies</i> mosquitoes. The mAbs AC-43 and AC-29 significantly inhibited <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> development inside the mosquito midgut. The number of oocysts that developed was reduced by 78.6% when mosquitoes ingested a combination of these two mAbs along with the blood meal. AC-43 mAb binds to the epitope common in 97, 80 and 43 kDa polypeptides from the midgut protein extract, as indicated by western blot analysis. Similarly, the mAb AC-29 recognized 52, 44, 40 and 29 kDa polypeptides. These female midgut-specific polypeptides are shared between <i>An. culicifacies</i> and <i>An. stephensi</i>, two major vectors of malaria in India. Deglycosylation assays revealed that 𝑂-linked carbohydrates are the major components in epitopes corresponding to AC-43 and AC-29. Gold particle labelling revealed that both these mAbs preferentially bind to glycoproteins at the apical microvilli and the microvillus-associated network present inside transverse sections of the gut epithelium. These regions are particularly known to have receptors for ookinetes, which enable them to cross this epithelial barrier and provide them with certain necessary chemicals or components for further development into oocysts. Therefore, these glycoproteins appear to be potential candidates for a vectordirected transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV).</p>

				<title><i>Narcissus tazetta</i> lectin shows strong inhibitory effects against respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) and B viruses</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0095-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amannose-binding lectin (<i>Narcissus tazetta</i> lectin [NTL]) with potent antiviral activity was isolated and purified from the bulbs of the Chinese daffodil <i>Narcissus tazetta</i> var. <i>chinensis</i>, using ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose, affinity chromatography on mannose–agarose and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC)-gel filtration on Superose 12. The purified lectin was shown to have an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa by gel filtration and 13 kDa by SDS–PAGE, indicating that it is probably a dimer with two identical subunits. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of NTL as determined by molecular cloning also reveals that NTL protein contains a mature polypeptide consisting of 105 amino acids and a C-terminal peptide extension. Three-dimensional modelling study demonstrated that the NTL primary polypeptide contains three subdomains, each with a conserved mannose-binding site. It shows a high homology of about 60%–80% similarity with the existing monocot mannose-binding lectins. NTL could significantly inhibit plaque formation by the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.30 𝜇g/ml and exhibit strong antiviral properties against influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) and influenza B viruses with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.20 𝜇g/ml to 1.33 𝜇g/ml in a dose-dependent manner. It is worth noting that the modes of antiviral action of NTL against RSV and influenza A virus are significantly different. NTL is effective in the inhibition of RSV during the whole viral infection cycle, but the antiviral activity of NTL is mainly expressed at the early stage of the viral cycle of influenza A (H1N1) virus. NTL with a high selective index (SI=CC<sub>50</sub>/IC<sub>50</sub> &#8805; 141) resulting from its potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity demonstrates a potential for biotechnological development as an antiviral agent.</p>

				<title>Flanking region sequence information to refine microRNA target predictions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0105-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The non-coding elements of a genome, with many of them considered as junk earlier, have now started gaining long due respectability, with microRNAs as the best current example. MicroRNAs bind preferentially to the 3&#8242; untranslated regions (UTRs) of the target genes and negatively regulate their expression most of the time. Several microRNA:target prediction softwares have been developed based upon various assumptions and the majority of them consider the free energy of binding of a target to its microRNA and seed conservation. However, the average concordance between the predictions made by these softwares is limited and compounded by a large number of false-positive results. In this study, we describe a methodology developed by us to refine microRNA:target prediction by target prediction softwares through observations made from a comprehensive study. We incorporated the information obtained from dinucleotide content variation patterns recorded for flanking regions around the target sites using support vector machines (SVMs) trained over two different major sources of experimental data, besides other sources. We assessed the performance of our methodology with rigorous tests over four different dataset models and also compared it with a recently published refinement tool, MirTif. Our methodology attained a higher average accuracy of 0.88, average sensitivity and specificity of 0.81 and 0.94, respectively, and areas under the curves (AUCs) for all the four models scored above 0.9, suggesting better performance by our methodology and a possible role of flanking regions in microRNA targeting control. We used our methodology over genes of three different pathways – toll-like receptor (TLR), apoptosis and insulin – to finally predict the most probable targets. We also investigated their possible regulatory associations, and identified a hsa-miR-23a regulatory module.</p>

				<title>The Fungal Genetics Stock Center: a repository for 50 years of fungal genetics research</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0119-0126</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) was established in 1960 to ensure that important strains used in early genetics research were available to subsequent generations of fungal geneticists. Originally, only mutant strains were held. At present, any organism that has had its genome sequenced is a genetic system and so the FGSC has added many new organisms. The FGSC is well integrated in its core community and, as research came to depend on cloned genes, vectors and gene libraries, the FGSC included these materials. When the community expanded to include plant and human pathogens, the FGSC adopted these systems as well. Wild isolates from around the world have also proven instrumental in answering important questions. The FGSC holds tremendous diversity of the Neurospora species, which form the core of the collection. The growth in the number of strains distributed illustrates the growth in research on fungi. Because of its position near the centre of the fungal genetics effort, the FGSC is also the first to see trends in research directions. One recent example is the 300% jump in requests for strains of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> carrying a mutation that makes them sensitive to high salt concentration. These strains were seldom requested over many years, but became among our most popular resources following the demonstration of their utility in studying fungicide resistance. This exemplifies why materials need to be preserved without regard to their immediate perceived value and reinforces the need for long-term support for preservation of a broad variety of genetic resources.</p>

				<title>Lysozymes in the animal kingdom</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0127-0160</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lysozymes (EC 3.2.1.17) are hydrolytic enzymes, characterized by their ability to cleave the 𝛽-(1,4)-glycosidic bond between 𝑁-acetylmuramic acid and 𝑁-acetylglucosamine in peptidoglycan, the major bacterial cell wall polymer. In the animal kingdom, three major distinct lysozyme types have been identified – the c-type (chicken or conventional type), the g-type (goose-type) and the i-type (<i>i</i>nvertebrate type) lysozyme. Examination of the phylogenetic distribution of these lysozymes reveals that c-type lysozymes are predominantly present in the phylum of the Chordata and in different classes of the Arthropoda. Moreover, g-type lysozymes (or at least their corresponding genes) are found in members of the Chordata, as well as in some bivalve mollusks belonging to the invertebrates. In general, the latter animals are known to produce i-type lysozymes. Although the homology in primary structure for representatives of these three lysozyme types is limited, their three-dimensional structures show striking similarities. Nevertheless, some variation exists in their catalytic mechanisms and the genomic organization of their genes. Regarding their biological role, the widely recognized function of lysozymes is their contribution to antibacterial defence but, additionally, some lysozymes (belonging to different types) are known to function as digestive enzymes.</p>

				<title>Deccan volcanism, the KT mass extinction and dinosaurs</title>
				<feature>Erratum</feature>
				<page>0161-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent advances in Deccan volcanic studies indicate three volcanic phases with the phase-1 at 67.5 Ma followed by a 2 m.y. period of quiescence. Phase-2 marks the main Deccan volcanic eruptions in Chron 29r near the end of the Maastrichtian and accounts for &#8764;80% of the entire 3500 m thick Deccan lava pile. At least four of the world’s longest lava flows spanning 1000 km across India and out into the Gulf of Bengal mark phase-2. The final phase-3 was smaller, coincided with the early Danian Chron 29n and also witnessed several of the longest lava flows.</p>
					<p>The KT boundary and mass extinction was first discovered based on planktic foraminifera from shallow marine intertrappean sediments exposed in Rajahmundry quarries between the longest lava flows of the main volcanic phase-2 and smaller phase-3. At this locality early Danian (zone P1a) planktic foraminiferal assemblages directly overlie the top of phase-2 eruptions and indicate that the masse extinction coincided with the end of this volcanic phase. Planktic foraminiferal assemblages also mark the KT boundary in intertrappean sediments at Jhilmili, Chhindwara, where freshwater to estuarine conditions prevailed during the early Danian and indicate the presence of a marine seaway across India at KT time.</p>
					<p>Dinosaur bones, nesting sites with complete eggs and abundant eggshells are known from central India surrounding the hypothesized seaway through the Narmada-Tapti rift zone. A Maastrichtian age is generally assigned to these dinosaur remains. Age control may now be improved based on marine microfossils from sequences deposited in the seaway and correlating these strata to nearby terrestrial sequences with dinosaur remains.</p>

					<p>When a firefly is made to inhale ethyl acetate vapour, a constant glow appears after a few minutes from its abdominal lantern. This <i>control experiment</i> has been performed by a few workers to record the emission spectrum of the firefly. However, a time-resolved experiment performed by us on this continuous light emitted by the species <i>Luciola praeusta</i> Kiesenwetter 1874 (Coleoptera : Lampyridae : Luciolinae) reveals that it is composed of a continuous train of tiny pulses!

				<title>Spectrum of <i>CREBBP</i> mutations in Indian patients with Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0187-0202</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS), a developmental disorder comprising abnormalities that include mental retardation, an unusual facial appearance, broad thumbs and big toes is frequently associated with molecular lesions in the CREB-binding protein gene, <i>CREBBP</i>. The objective of the present study was to identify and analyse <i>CREBBP</i> mutations in Indian RSTS patients on which there are no data. Direct sequencing of <i>CREBBP</i> performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots in which ten novel pathogenic mutations were localized. Functional analysis revealed that three of these mutations affecting amino acids Glu1459, Leu1668 and Glu1724 were critical for histone acetyltransferase activity. Twenty-eight novel <i>CREBBP</i> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also identified in the Indian population. Linkage disequilibrium studies revealed associations between </p>
					<ol>
						<li>SNP (<i>rs129974</i>/c.3836-206G &#62; C) and mutation (p.Asp1340Ala);</li>
						<li>(<i>rs130002</i>) with mutation (p.Asn435Lys) and</li>
						<li>SNPs <i>rs129974, rs130002</i> and SNP (<i>c.3836</i>-206G &#62; C) signifying a disease affection status.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>In conclusion, the present study reports the highest detection rate of <i>CREBBP</i> mutations (76.9%) in RSTS patients to date, of which ten are predicted to be pathogenic and three critical for histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, identification of the association of <i>CREBBP</i> polymorphisms with disease susceptibility could be an important risk factor for the pathogenesis of RSTS.</p>

				<title>Tumour bed irradiation of human tumour xenografts in a nude rat model using a common X-ray tube</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0203-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studies that investigate the radiation of human tumour xenografts require an appropriate radiation source and highly standardized conditions during radiation. This work reports on the design of a standardized irradiation device using a commercially available X-ray tube with a custom constructed lead collimator with two circular apertures and an animal bed plate, permitting synchronous irradiation of two animals. Dosimetry and the corresponding methodology for radiotherapy of human non-small cell lung cancer xenograft tumours transplanted to and growing subcutaneously on the right lower limb in a nude rat model were investigated. Procedures and results described herein prove the feasibility of use of the device, which is applicable for any investigation involving irradiation of non-tumorous and tumorous lesions in small animals.</p>

				<title>Inhibition of human lung adenocarcinoma growth using survivint34a by low-dose systematic administration</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0209-0216</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Anti-apoptosis plays an important role in tumour formation and development. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, which is a target for anti-cancer drug exploitation was replaced as development. We investigated the role of the homo dominant-negative mutant Survivin-T34A in suppressing human lung adenocarcinomas (A549). The anti-tumour activity of HSurvivinT34A plasmid was evaluated in the A549 cell line and nude mice bearing A549 subcutaneous tumours. Low-dose systemic administration was continuously used. The HSurvivinT34A plasmid (5 𝜇g/one) complexed with a cationic liposome (DOTAP/Chol) significantly inhibited tumour growth in our model. We observed microvessel density degradation by CD31 immunohistochemistry and apoptotic cell increase by TUNEL assay, PI staining and flow cytometric analysis in the treated group. The present findings suggest that the HSurvivinT34A plasmid complexed with a cationic liposome may provide an effective approach to inhibit the growth of human lung adenocarcinomas <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

				<title>Activated charcoal filter effectively reduces p-benzosemiquinone from the mainstream cigarette smoke and prevents emphysema</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0217-0230</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we have made a comparative evaluation of the cytotoxicity and pathophysiological effects of mainstream smoke from cellulose acetate (CA)-filtered cigarettes with that of charcoal-filtered cigarettes developed in our laboratory. Previously, we had demonstrated that the mainstream smoke from an Indian CA-filtered commercial cigarette contains p-benzosemiquinone (p-BSQ), a major, highly toxic, long-lived water-soluble radical. Here, we have examined 16 brands of different CA-filtered cigarettes including Kentucky research cigarettes, and observed that mainstream smoke from all the cigarettes contains substantial amounts of p-BSQ (100–200 𝜇g/cigarette). We also show that when the CA filter is replaced by a charcoal filter, the amount of p-BSQ in the mainstream smoke is reduced by 73–80%, which is accompanied by a reduction of carbonyl formation in bovine serum albumin to the extent of 70–90%. The charcoal filter also prevented cytotoxicity in A549 cells as evidenced by MTT assay, apoptosis as evidenced by FACS analysis, TUNEL assay, overexpression of Bax, activation of p53 and caspase 3, as well as emphysematous lung damage in a guinea pig model as seen by histology and morphometric analysis. The results indicate that the charcoal filter developed in our laboratory may protect smokers from cigarette smoke-induced cytotoxity, protein modification, apoptosis and emphysema.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mango ginger (<i>Curcuma amada</i> Roxb.) rhizome is used in the manufacture of pickles and other food preparations due to its unique raw mango flavour. The chloroform extract of mango ginger rhizome was subjected to antibacterial activity-guided purification by repeated silica gel column chromatography to obtain a pure compound. The structure of the isolated compound was deduced by analysing UV, IR, LC-MS and 2D-HMQCT NMR spectral data, and named it as amadaldehyde, a novel compound. It exhibited a wide range of antibacterial activity with potential bactericidal activity against several bacteria. The purified compound also exhibited antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity and platelet aggregation inhibitory activities.</p>

				<title>Characterization of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> adhesin thiol peroxidase (HP0390) purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0241-0248</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The antioxidant protein, adhesin thiol peroxidase (<i>Hp</i>Tpx or HP0390), plays an important role in enabling <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> to survive gastric oxidative stress. The bacterium colonizes the host stomach and produces gastric cancer. However, little information is available about the biochemical characteristics of <i>Hp</i>Tpx. We expressed recombinant <i>Hp</i>Tpx in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, purified to homogeneity, and characterized it. The results showed that <i>Hp</i>Tpx existed in a monomeric hydrodynamic form and the enzyme fully retained its peroxidase and antioxidant activities. The catalytic reaction of the enzyme was similar to an atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (Prx). The conformation of the enzyme was observed in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol (DTT); similar to other known thiol peroxidases, conformational change was observed in <i>Hp</i>Tpx by the addition of DTT.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The cephalic salivary glands of some species of bees are exclusive and well developed only in Apinae. These glands were studied with light and scanning electron microscopy in workers, queens and males from the honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i>, and the stingless bee <i>Scaptotrigona postica</i> in different life phases. The results show that the cephalic salivary glands are present in females of both the species, and in males of <i>S. postica</i>. Nevertheless, they are poorly developed in young males of <i>A. mellifera</i>. In both species, gland growth is progressive from the time of emergence to the oldest age but, in <i>A. mellifera</i> males, the gland degenerates with age. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the secretory units of newly emerged workers are collapsed while in older workers they are turgid. Some pits on the surface of the secretory units correspond to open intercellular spaces. The possible functions of these glands in females and males of both species are discussed.</p>

				<title>Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0257-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>When males are the larger sex, a positive allometric relationship between male and female sizes is often found across populations of a single species (i.e. Rensch’s rule). This pattern is typically explained by a sexual selection pressure on males. Here, we report that the allometric relationship was negative across populations of a shell-brooding cichlid fish <i>Lamprologus callipterus</i>, although males are extremely larger than females. Male <i>L. callipterus</i> collect and defend empty snail shells in each of which a female breeds. We found that, across six populations, male and female sizes are positively correlated with not only sexual and fecundity selection indices, but also with shell sizes. Given their different reproductive behaviours, these correlations mean that males are required to be more powerful, and thus larger, to transport larger shells, while female bodies are reduced to the shell size to enable them to enter the shells. Among the three size selections (sexual selection, fecundity selection and shell size), shell size explained the allometry, suggesting that females are more strongly subject to size selection associated with shell size availability than males. However, the allometry was violated when considering an additional population where size-selection regimes of males differed from that of other populations. Therefore, sexual size allometry will be violated by body size divergence induced by multiple selection regimes.</p>

				<title>Genetic and clonal diversity of the endemic ant-plant <i>Humboldtia brunonis</i> (Fabaceae) in the Western Ghats of India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0267-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Humboldtia brunonis</i> (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) is a dominant self-incompatible ant-plant or myrmecophyte, growing as an understorey tree in high-density patches. It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager’s evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon’s diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei’s gene diversity (0.1186). In each population, observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected, indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations, grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of &#60; 5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (<i>Braunsapis puangensis</i>) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales. The clonality of <i>H. brunonis</i> may be a factor that contributes to its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity of invertebrate fauna.</p>

				<title>An insight into the sequential, structural and phylogenetic properties of banana 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 1 and study of its interaction with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and aminoethoxyvinylglycine</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0281-0294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In banana, ethylene production for ripening is accompanied by a dramatic increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) content, transcript level of <i>Musa acuminata</i> ACC synthase 1 (<i>MA-ACS1</i>) and the enzymatic activity of ACC synthase 1 at the onset of the climacteric period. MA-ACS1 catalyses the conversion of 𝑆-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to ACC, the key regulatory step in ethylene biosynthesis. Multiple sequence alignments of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) amino acid sequences based on database searches have indicated that MA-ACS1 is a highly conserved protein across the plant kingdom. This report describes an <i>in silico</i> analysis to provide the first important insightful information about the sequential, structural and phylogenetic characteristics of MA-ACS1. The three-dimensional structure of MA-ACS1, constructed based on homology modelling, in combination with the available data enabled a comparative mechanistic analysis of MA-ACS1 to explain the catalytic roles of the conserved and non-conserved active site residues. We have further demonstrated that, as in apple and tomato, banana-ACS1 (MA-ACS1) forms a homodimer and a complex with cofactor pyridoxal-5&#8242;-phosphate (PLP) and inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG). We have also predicted that the residues from the PLP-binding pocket, essential for ligand binding, are mostly conserved across the MA-ACS1 structure and the competitive inhibitor AVG binds at a location adjacent to PLP.</p>

				<title>Aligning protein sequence and analysing substitution pattern using a class-specific matrix</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0295-0314</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aligning protein sequences using a score matrix has became a routine but valuable method in modern biological research. However, alignment in the ‘twilight zone’ remains an open issue. It is feasible and necessary to construct a new score matrix as more protein structures are resolved. Three structural class-specific score matrices (all-alpha, all-beta and alpha/beta) were constructed based on the structure alignment of low identity proteins of the corresponding structural classes. The class-specific score matrices were significantly better than a structure-derived matrix (HSDM) and three other generalized matrices (BLOSUM30, BLOSUM60 and Gonnet250) in alignment performance tests. The optimized gap penalties presented here also promote alignment performance. The results indicate that different protein classes have distinct amino acid substitution patterns, and an amino acid score matrix should be constructed based on different structural classes. The class-specific score matrices could also be used in profile construction to improve homology detection.</p>

				<title>Alfred Russel Wallace deserves better</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0339-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During 2009, while we were celebrating Charles Darwin and his <i>The origin of species</i>, sadly, little was said about the critical contribution of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913) to the development of the theory of evolution. Like Darwin, he was a truly remarkable nineteenth century intellect and polymath and, according to a recent book by Roy Davies (<i>The Darwin conspiracy: origins of a scientific crime</i>), he has a stronger claim to the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection than has Darwin. Here we present a critical comparison between the contributions of the two scientists. Sometimes referred to as ‘The other beetle-hunter’ and largely neglected for many decades, Wallace had a far greater experience of collecting and investigating animals and plants from their native habitats than had Darwin. He was furthermore much more than a pioneer biogeographer and evolutionary theorist, and also made contributions to anthropology, ethnography, geology, land reform and social issues. However, being a more modest, self-deprecating man than Darwin, and lacking the latter’s establishment connections, Wallace’s contribution to the theory of evolution was not given the recognition it deserved and he was undoubtedly shabbily treated at the time. It is time that Wallace’s relationship with Darwin is reconsidered in preparation for 2013, the centenary of Wallace’s death, and he should be recognized as at least an equal in the Wallace–Darwin theory of evolution.</p>

				<title>INDeGenIUS, a new method for high-throughput identification of specialized functional islands in completely sequenced organisms</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0351-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genomic islands (GIs) are regions in the genome which are believed to have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer events and are thus likely to be compositionally distinct from the rest of the genome. Majority of the genes located in a GI encode a particular function. Depending on the genes they encode, GIs can be classified into various categories, such as `metabolic islands’, `symbiotic islands’, `resistance islands’, `pathogenicity islands’, etc. The computational process for GI detection is known and many algorithms for the same are available. We present a new method termed as Improved N-mer based Detection of Genomic Islands Using Sequence-clustering (INDeGenIUS) for the identification of GIs. This method was applied to 400 completely sequenced species belonging to proteobacteria. Based on the genes encoded in the identified GIs, the GIs were grouped into 6 categories: metabolic islands, symbiotic islands, resistance islands, secretion islands, pathogenicity islands and motility islands. Several new islands of interest which had previously been missed out by earlier algorithms were picked up as GIs by INDeGenIUS. The present algorithm has potential application in the identification of functionally relevant GIs in the large number of genomes that are being sequenced. Investigation of the predicted GIs in pathogens may lead to identification of potential drug/vaccine candidates.</p>

				<title>Transcription pattern of <i>UL131A</i>-128 mRNA in clinical strains of human cytomegalovirus</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0365-0370</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) mRNA was obtained from human embryonic lung fibroblast cells infected by HCMV clinical strains from urine samples of infants at different kinetic periods. The cDNA of <i>UL131A-128</i> mRNAs was amplified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analysed by sequencing. Mean while, clones containing <i>UL131A-128</i> transcripts in an HCMV cDNA library of a clinical strain were selected and sequenced. It was demonstrated that <i>UL131A-128</i> mRNA was expressed with immediately early, early and late kinetics. Sequences obtained by RT-PCR showed that the <i>UL131A</i> gene consisted of two exons and the coding region of the <i>UL130</i> gene was not interrupted by any intron in the region as reported earlier. However, the transcript of the <i>UL128</i> gene showed two patterns: one pattern consisted of three exons as reported earlier; the other contained the three exons and also the first intron. Moreover, the above characteristics of <i>UL131A-128</i> spliced transcripts were confirmed by the sequences of clones selected from the HCMV cDNA library. Our results demonstrated that the <i>UL131A, UL130</i> and <i>UL128</i> genes were transcribed with the 3&#8242;-coterminal, although the initiation points of their mRNA may be different. The variation in the transcripts found in our study indicated the complex nature of transcription of <i>UL131A-128</i> genes in clinical strains of HCMV.</p>

				<title>The ruthenium complex <i>cis</i>-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride induces apoptosis and damages DNA in murine sarcoma 180 cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0371-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ruthenium(III) complexes are increasingly attracting the interest of researchers due to their promising pharmacological properties. Recently, we reported that the cis-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride compound has cytotoxic effects on murine sarcoma 180 (S-180) cells. In an effort to understand the mechanism responsible for their cytotoxicity, study we investigated the genotoxicity, cell cycle distribution and induction of apoptosis caused by cis-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride in S-180 tumour cells. <i>cis</i>-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride treatment induced significant DNA damage in S-180 cells, as detected by the alkaline comet assay. In the cell cycle analysis, <i>cis</i>-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride caused an increase in the number of cells in G1 phase, accompanied by a decrease in the S and G2 phases after 24 h of treatment. In contrast, the cell cycle distribution of S-180 cells treated with <i>cis</i>-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride for 48 h showed a concentration-dependent increase in the sub-G1 phase (indicating apoptosis), with a corresponding decrease in cells in the G1, S and G2 phases. In addition, <i>cis</i>-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride treatment induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, as observed by the increased numbers of annexin V-positive cells. Taken together, these findings strongly demonstrate that DNA damage, cell cycle changes and apoptosis may correlate with the cytotoxic effects of <i>cis</i>-(dichloro)tetrammineruthenium(III) chloride on S-180 cells.</p>

				<title>Isolation and characterization of a gene encoding a polyethylene glycol-induced cysteine protease in common wheat</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0379-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plant cysteine protease (CP) genes are induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, yet their functions remain largely unknown. We isolated the full-length cDNA encoding a <i>Triticum aestivum</i> CP gene, designated <i>TaCP</i>, from wheat by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. Sequence analysis revealed that <i>TaCP</i> contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 362 amino acids, which is 96% identical to barley cysteine protease HvSF42. The <i>TaCP</i> transcript level in wheat seedlings was upregulated during polyethylene glycol (PEG) stress, with a peak appearing around 12 h after treatment. <i>TaCP</i> expression level increased rapidly with NaCl treatment at 48 h. <i>TaCP</i> responded strongly to low temperature (4&#176;C) treatment from 1 h post-treatment and reached a peak of about 40-fold at 72 h. However, it showed only a very slight response to abscisic acid (ABA). More than one copy of <i>TaCP</i> was present in each of the three genomes of hexaploid wheat and its diploid donors. TaCP fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was located in the plasma membrane of onion epidermis cells. Transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants overexpressing <i>TaCP</i> showed stronger drought tolerance and higher CP activity under water-stressed conditions than wild-type <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants. The results suggest that <i>TaCP</i> plays a role in tolerance to water deficit.</p>

				<title>Designing exons for human olfactory receptor gene subfamilies using a mathematical paradigm</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0389-0393</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ligands for only two human olfactory receptors are known. One of them, OR1D2, binds to Bourgeonal, a volatile chemical constituent of the fragrance of the mythical flower, Lily of the valley or Our Lady’s tears, <i>Convallaria majalis</i> (also the national flower of Finland). OR1D2, OR1D4 and OR1D5 are three full-length olfactory receptors present in an olfactory locus in the human genome. These receptors are more than 80% identical in DNA sequences and have 108 base pair mismatches among them. Apparently, these mismatch positions show no striking pattern using computer pattern recognition tools. In an attempt to find a mathematical rule in those mismatches, we find that an L-system generated sequence can be inserted into the OR1D2 subfamily-specific star model and novel full-length olfactory receptors can be generated. This remarkable mathematical principle could be utilized for making new subfamily olfactory receptor members from any olfactory receptor subfamily. The aroma and electronic nose industry might utilize this rule in future.</p>

				<title>A new multi-wavelength model-based method for determination of enzyme kinetic parameters</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0395-0403</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lineweaver–Burk plot analysis is the most widely used method to determine enzyme kinetic parameters. In the spectrophotometric determination of enzyme activity using the Lineweaver–Burk plot, it is necessary to find a wavelength at which only the substrate or the product has absorbance without any spectroscopic interference of the other reaction components. Moreover, in this method, different initial concentrations of the substrate should be used to obtain the initial velocities required for Lineweaver–Burk plot analysis. In the present work, a multi-wavelength model-based method has been developed and validated to determine Michaelis–Menten constants for some enzyme reactions. In this method, a selective wavelength region and several experiments with different initial concentrations of the substrate are not required. The absorbance data of the kinetic assays are fitted by non-linear regression coupled to the numeric integration of the related differential equation. To indicate the applicability of the proposed method, the Michaelis–Menten constants for the oxidation of phenanthridine, 6-deoxypenciclovir and xanthine by molybdenum hydroxylases were determined using only a single initial concentration of the substrate, regardless of any spectral overlap.</p>

				<title>Identification, tissue distribution and evaluation of brain neuropeptide Y gene expression in the Brazilian flounder <i>Paralichthys orbignyanus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0405-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most potent stimulants of food intake in vertebrates, mammals and fish. However, the present knowledge about feeding behaviour in fish is still limited and based on studies in a few species. The Brazilian flounder <i>Paralichthys orbignyanus</i> is being considered for aquaculture, and it is important to understand the mechanisms regulating feeding in order to improve its performance in captivity. The objectives of this study were to clone NPY cDNA, evaluate the mRNA levels in different tissues of flounder, and also evaluate brain NPY expression to associate food intake with NPY expression levels. A 597 bp NPY cDNA was cloned from Brazilian flounder brain. NPY expression was detected in all the peripheral tissues analysed. No significant differences were observed in brain NPY gene expression over 24 h after food intake at a temperature of 15 &#177; 3&#176;C. No correlation was observed among plasma glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides and NPY expression levels during this 24 h period. On the other hand, mRNA levels were increased after two weeks of fasting at elevated temperatures. Our results suggest that NPY mRNA levels in Brazilian flounder are affected by temperature.</p>

				<title>Mitosis and cell death in the optic lobes of workers, queens and drones of the honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) during metamorphosis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0415-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Colonies of the honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>, consist of males and two female castes: workers and queens. The castes and males from <i>A. mellifera</i> have a distinct morphology, physiology and behaviour that correlate with their roles in the society and are characterized by some brain polymorphisms. Compound eyes are one of the characteristics that differ among the castes and sexes. <i>A. mellifera</i> is a holometabolous insect; therefore, the development of adult organs during metamorphosis, which will produce these differences, requires the precise coordination of three main programmed cellular processes: proliferation, differentiation and death. These processes take place simultaneously during pupation. Our purpose was to investigate cell division and death in the optic lobes (OL) of workers, queens and males during pupation to identify how the differences in the compound eyes in adults of these classes are achieved. The results showed that OL differentiation follows a similar pattern in the three classes of individuals studied, without structural differences in their development. The main non-structural differences involve cell division, mortality rates and timing. The results suggest a modelling of the brain during differentiation, which contributes to the specific functions of each individual class.</p>

				<title>Unusual radioresistance of nitrogen-fixing cultures of <i>Anabaena</i> strains</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0427-0434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nitrogen-fixing cultures of two species of the filamentous, heterocystous cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i>, namely <i>Anabaena</i> sp. strain L-31 and <i>Anabaena torulosa</i> were found to be highly tolerant to <sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation. No adverse effect on diazotrophic growth and metabolism were observed up to a dose of 5 kGy. At higher doses, radiation tolerance showed a correspondence with the inherent osmotolerance, with <i>Anabaena</i> L-31 being the more radiation tolerant as well as osmotolerant strain. In <i>Anabaena</i> L-31, exposure to 6 kGy of gamma rays resulted in genome disintegration, but did not reduce viability. Irradiation delayed heterocyst differentiation and nitrogen fixation, and marginally affected diazotrophic growth. All the affected parameters recovered after a short lag, without any discernible post-irradiation phenotype. The radiation tolerance of these Gram-negative photoautodiazotrophs is comparable with that of the adiazotrophic photoautotrophic cyanobacterium <i>Chroococcidiopsis</i> or adiazotrophic heterotroph <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>. This is the first report of extreme radioresistance in nitrogen-fixing <i>Anabaena</i> cultures.</p>

				<title>Thirty-seven transcription factor genes differentially respond to a harpin protein and affect resistance to the green peach aphid in <i>Arabidopsis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0435-0450</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The harpin protein HrpN<sub>Ea</sub> induces <i>Arabidopsis</i> resistance to the green peach aphid by activating the ethylene signalling pathway and by recruiting EIN2, an essential regulator of ethylene signalling, for a defence response in the plant. We investigated 37 ethylene-inducible <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcription factor genes for their effects on the activation of ethylene signalling and insect defence. Twenty-eight of the 37 genes responded to both ethylene and HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>, and showed either increased or inhibited transcription, while 18 genes showed increased transcription not only by ethylene but also by HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>. In response to HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>, transcription levels of 22 genes increased, with <i>AtMYB44</i> being the most inducible, six genes had decreased transcript levels, and nine remained unchanged. When <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutants previously generated by mutagenicity at the 37 genes were surveyed, 24 mutants were similar to the wild type plant while four mutants were more resistant and nine mutants were more susceptible than wild type to aphid infestation. Aphid-susceptible mutants showed a greater susceptibility for <i>atmyb15, atmyb38</i> and <i>atmyb44</i>, which were generated previously by T-DNA insertion into the exon region of <i>AtMYB15</i> and the promoter regions of <i>AtMYB38</i> and <i>AtMYB44</i>. The <i>atmyb44</i> mutant was the most susceptible to aphid infestation and most compromised in induced resistance. Resistance accompanied the expression of <i>PDF1.2</i>, an ethylene signalling marker gene that requires <i>EIN2</i> for transcription in wild type but not in <i>atmyb15, atmyb38</i>, and <i>atmyb44</i>, suggesting a disruption of ethylene signalling in the mutants. However, only <i>atmyb44</i> incurred an abrogation in induced <i>EIN2</i> expression, suggesting a close relationship between <i>AtMYB44</i> and <i>EIN2</i>.</p>

				<title>Interactions between ethylene, abscisic acid and cytokinin during germination and seedling establishment in <i>Arabidopsis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0451-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to investigate the interaction of the plant hormones ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin in seed germination and early seedling development, we studied germination in ethylene-related mutants of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Mutations in the genes <i>etr1</i> and <i>ein2</i>, which reduce ethylene responses, showed increased dormancy and a delay in germination in comparison with wild type. Mutations in <i>etr1, ein2</i> and <i>ein6</i> also resulted in increased sensitivity to ABA with respect to inhibition of germination. Conversely, mutations in <i>ctr1</i> and <i>eto3</i>, which lead to an increased ethylene response and overproduction of ethylene, respectively, decreased sensitivity to ABA during germination. Increased ABA sensitivity was also effected in wild type seeds by the presence during germination of AgNO<sub>3</sub>, an inhibitor of ethylene action. The addition of the cytokinin N-6 benzyl adenine (BA) reversed the increased sensitivity of ethylene-resistant mutants to ABA. The action of cytokinin in reversing increased ABA sensitivity of ethylene-resistant mutants also suggests that at least part of the action of cytokinin in promoting germination is independent of its role in stimulating ethylene production. These observations further extend the evidence in support of interaction between ethylene, ABA and cytokinin signalling in controlling seed germination and early seedling development in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.</p>

				<title>Overexpression of <i>OsWRKY72</i> gene interferes in the abscisic acid signal and auxin transport pathway of <i>Arabidopsis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0459-0471</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Through activating specific transcriptional programmes, plants can launch resistance mechanisms to stressful environments and acquire a new equilibrium between development and defence. To screen the rice WRKY transcription factor which functions in abiotic stress tolerance and modulates the abscisic acid (ABA) response, we generated a whole array of <i>35S-OsWRKY</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. In this study, we report that <i>35S-OsWRKY72</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>, whose seed germination was retarded under normal conditions, emerged more sensitive to mannitol, NaCl, ABA stresses and sugar starvation than vector plants. Meanwhile, <i>35S-OsWRKY72</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> displayed early flowering, reduced apical dominance, lost high temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation response, and enhanced gravitropism response, which were similar to the auxin-related gene mutants <i>aux1, axr1</i> and <i>bud1</i>. Further, semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression patterns of three auxin-related genes <i>AUX1, AXR1</i> and <i>BUD1</i> were significantly altered in rosette leaves and inflorescences of <i>35S-OsWRKY72</i> plants compared with control <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and two ABA-related genes <i>ABA2</i> and <i>ABI4</i> were induced in <i>35S-OsWRKY72</i> seedlings. In addition, northern blot analysis indicated that, in rice, <i>OsWRKY72</i> was inducible by polyethylene glycol (PEG), NaCl, naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), ABA and 42&#176;C, similar to its orthologue <i>AtWRKY75</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, implying that these two <i>WRKY</i> genes might be required for multiple physiological processes in their plants. Together, these results suggest that OsWRKY72 interferes in the signal cross-talk between the ABA signal and auxin transport pathway in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>.</p>

				<title>Hormonal regulation of gluconeogenic gene transcription in the liver</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0473-0484</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glucose homeostasis in mammals is achieved by the actions of counterregulatory hormones, namely insulin, glucagon and glucocorticoids. Glucose levels in the circulation are regulated by the liver, the metabolic centre which produces glucose when it is scarce in the blood. This process is catalysed by two rate-limiting enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) whose gene expression is regulated by hormones. Hormone response units (HRUs) present in the two genes integrate signals from various signalling pathways triggered by hormones. How such domains are arranged in the regulatory region of these two genes, how this complex regulation is accomplished and the latest advancements in the field are discussed in this review.</p>

					<p>Kinetochores mediate chromosome movement during cell division by interacting with the spindle microtubules. Sexual reproduction necessitates the daunting task of reducing ploidy (number of chromosome sets) in the gametes, which depends upon the specialized properties of meiosis.

				<abstract>
					<p>It appears that developed countries, such as the US, the UK and Italy, are losing the race against irrationalism and arbitrary thinking in regard to nature and human interactions. The incidence of misguided beliefs and the detachment from and, in some cases, outright hostility toward science are on the rise. Paradoxically, this is probably the period in the history of advanced countries in which increasing public and personal efforts have been directed toward the dissemination of scientific knowledge to increase public understanding of science. This article vindicates the role of natural history museums in consolidating rational and critical scientific thinking while briefly examining scientific illiteracy in developed countries. It also discusses methods to improve the involvement of natural history museums in the promotion of rational thinking, the only appropriate avenue for objective knowledge.</p>

				<title>Evidence for functional interaction of plasma membrane electron transport, voltage-dependent anion channel and volume-regulated anion channel in frog aorta</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0519-0524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Frog aortic tissue exhibits plasma membrane electron transport (PMET) owing to its ability to reduce ferricyanide even in the presence of mitochondrial poisons, such as cyanide and azide. Exposure to hypotonic solution (108 mOsmol/kg H<sub>2</sub>O) enhanced the reduction of ferricyanide in excised aortic tissue of frog. Increment in ferricyanide reductase activity was also brought about by the presence of homocysteine (100 𝜇M dissolved in isotonic frog Ringer solution), a redox active compound and a potent modulator of PMET. Two plasma-membrane-bound channels, the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), are involved in the response to hypotonic stress. The presence of VRAC and VDAC antagonists–tamoxifen, glibenclamide, fluoxetine and verapamil, and 4,4&#8242;-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2&#8242;-disulphonic acid (DIDS), respectively–inhibited this enhanced activity brought about by either hypotonic stress or homocysteine. The blockers do not affect the ferricyanide reductase activity under isotonic conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate a functional interaction of the three plasma membrane proteins, namely, ferricyanide reductase (PMET), VDAC and VRAC.</p>

				<feature>Brief communication</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Insulin-stimulated translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to cell membrane leading to glucose uptake is the rate-limiting step in diabetes. It is also a defined target of antidiabetic drug research. Existing GLUT4 translocation assays are based on time-consuming immunoassays and are hampered by assay variability and low sensitivity. We describe a real-time, visual, cell-based qualitative GLUT4 translocation assay using CHO-HIRc-myc-GLUT4eGFP cells that stably express myc- and eGFP-tagged GLUT4 in addition to human insulin receptor (HIRc). GLUT4 translocation is visualized by live cell imaging based on GFP fluorescence by employing a cooled charge-coupled device camera attached to a fluorescent microscope. This video imaging method and further quantitative analysis of GLUT4 on the cell membrane provide rapid and foolproof visual evidence that this method is suitable for screening GLUT4 translocation modulators.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In an attempt to isolate bioactive constituents, ethyl acetate cone extract of <i>Metasequoia glyptostroboides</i> was subjected to a column chromatographic analysis that resulted in isolation of an abietane-type diterpenoid, taxodone. Its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic means. Further, taxodone showed potential antibacterial effect as diameters of zones of inhibition against foodborne pathogenic bacteria, such as <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> ATCC 19166, <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> KCTC 2515, <i>S. enteritidis</i> KCTC 2021, <i>Escherichia coli</i> ATCC 8739, <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 ATCC 43888, <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i> KCTC 2190, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ATCC 6538 and <i>S. aureus</i> KCTC 1916, were found in the range of 9.4 to 14.2 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of taxodone against the employed bacterial pathogens were found in the range of 250 to 1000 and 250 to &#60; 2000 𝜇g/ml, respectively. Also the compound had a strong antibacterial effect on the viable counts of the tested bacteria. These findings indicate that the bioactive compound taxodone present in <i>M. glyptostroboides</i> could be used as an antibacterial agent in food industry to inhibit the growth of certain important foodborne pathogens.</p>

				<title>Translocations used to generate chromosome segment duplications in <i>Neurospora</i> can disrupt genes and create novel open reading frames</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0539-0546</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, crosses between normal sequence strains and strains bearing some translocations can yield progeny bearing a duplication (<i>Dp</i>) of the translocated chromosome segment. Here, 30 breakpoint junction sequences of 12 <i>Dp</i>-generating translocations were determined. The breakpoints disrupted 13 genes (including predicted genes), and created 10 novel open reading frames. Insertion of sequences from LG III into LG I as translocation <i>T(UK818)</i> disrupts the <i>eat-3</i> gene, which is the ortholog of the <i>Podospora anserine</i> gene <i>ami1</i>. Since <i>ami1</i>-homozygous <i>Podospora</i> crosses were reported to increase the frequency of repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), we performed crosses homozygous for a deficiency in <i>eat-3</i> to test for a corresponding increase in RIP frequency. However, our results suggested that, unlike in <i>Podospora</i>, the <i>eat-3</i> gene might be essential for ascus development in <i>Neurospora</i>. Duplication–heterozygous crosses are generally barren in <i>Neurospora</i>; however, by using molecular probes developed in this study, we could identify <i>Dp</i> segregants from two different translocation–heterozygous crosses, and using these we found that the barren phenotype of at least some duplication–heterozygous crosses was incompletely penetrant.</p>

				<title>Replacement of the C-terminal tetrapeptide (<sup>314</sup>PAPV<sup>317</sup> to <sup>314</sup>SSSM<sup>317</sup>) in interferon regulatory factor-2 alters its N-terminal DNA-binding activity</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0547-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) is an important transcription factor involved in cell growth regulation, immune response and cancer. IRF-2 can function as a transcriptional repressor and activator depending on its DNA-binding activity and protein–protein interactions. We compared the amino acid sequences of IRF-2 and found a C-terminal tetrapeptide (<sup>314</sup>PAPV<sup>317</sup>) of mouse IRF-2 to be different (<sup>314</sup>SSSM<sup>317</sup>) from human IRF-2. Recombinant GST-IRF-2 with <sup>314</sup>PAPV<sup>317</sup> (wild type) and <sup>314</sup>SSSM<sup>317</sup> (mutant) expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> were assessed for DNA-binding activity with <sup>32</sup>P-(GAAAGT)<sub>4</sub> by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Wild type- and mutant GST-IRF-2 showed similar expression patterns and immunoreactivities but different DNA-binding activities. Mutant (mt) IRF-2 formed higher-molecular-mass, more and stronger DNA–protein complexes in comparison to wild type (wt) IRF-2. Anti-IRF-2 antibody stabilized the DNA–protein complexes formed by both wt IRF-2 and mt IRF-2, resolving the differences. This suggests that PAPV and SSSM sequences at 314-317 in the C-terminal region of mouse and human IRF-2 contribute to conformation of IRF-2 and influence DNA-binding activity of the N-terminal region, indicating intramolecular interactions. Thus, evolution of IRF-2 from murine to human genome has resulted in subtle differences in C-terminal amino acid motifs, which may contribute to qualitative changes in IRF-2-dependent DNA-binding activity and gene expression.</p>

				<title>Proteomic analysis of cell lines to identify the irinotecan resistance proteins</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chemotherapeutic drug resistance is a frequent cause of treatment failure in colon cancer patients. Several mechanisms have been implicated in drug resistance. However, they are not sufficient to exhaustively account for this resistance emergence. In this study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and the PDQuest software analysis were applied to compare the differential expression of irinotecan-resistance-associated protein in human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo cells and irinotecan-resistant LoVo cells (LoVo/irinotecan). The differential protein dots were excised and analysed by ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Fifteen proteins were identified, including eight proteins with decreased expression and seven proteins with increased expression. The identified known proteins included those that function in diverse biological processes such as cellular transcription, cell apoptosis, electron transport/redox regulation, cell proliferation/differentiation and retinol metabolism pathways. Identification of such proteins could allow improved understanding of the mechanisms leading to the acquisition of chemoresistance.</p>

					<p>In folk medicine, <i>Adhatoda vasica</i> Ness. (Acanthaceae) is used to treat asthma and cough. The leaves of <i>A.vasica</i> were powdered and extracted with hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol. The hexane extract showed 97% reduction in colony-forming units (CFU) at 100 𝜇g/ml. The hexane extract was subjected to column chromatography. Two natural compounds, vasicine acetate and 2-acetyl benzylamine, were isolated from it. They were bioassayed against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. The two compounds showed strong antimycobacterial activity. Vasicine acetate and 2-acetyl benzylamine isolated from hexane extract of <i>A. vasica</i> leaves, significantly inhibited <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and one multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strain and one sensitive strain at 200 and 50 𝜇g/ml, respectively. Our study demonstrated that both the compounds, vasicine acetate and 2-acetyl benzylamine, could be evaluated further for developing a drug to control <i>M. tuberculosis</i>.</p>

				<page>0571-0581</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To study the underlying mechanism of gonadal growth during the attainment of puberty and to test a coincidence model, 7 experimental groups of 2-week-old male mice, <i>Mus musculus</i>, were administered the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, followed by the dopamine precursor, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine at hourly intervals of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 h (5 mg/100 g body weight per day for 13 days). At 11 days post-treatment, a suppression of gonadal activity was seen in the 7-h mice and a maximum suppression in the 8-h mice, along with a significantly increased degree of gonadal development in the 12-h mice, as compared with the controls. In addition to its known regulation of seasonal gonadal cycles, the relative position of two circadian neural oscillations may also affect the rate of gonadal development during the attainment of puberty in mice. Moreover, the present study provides an experimental paradigm to test the coincidence model of circadian oscillations.</p>

				<title>Guanidination of notexin alters its membrane-damaging activity in response to sphingomyelin and cholesterol</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0583-0593</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To elucidate the contribution of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activity of notexin to its ability to perturb membranes, comparative studies on the interaction of notexin and guanidinated notexin (Gu-notexin) with egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC), EYPC/egg yolk sphingomyelin (EYSM) and EYPC/EYSM/cholesterol vesicles were conducted. EYSM notably reduced the membrane-damaging activity of notexin against EYPC vesicles, but had an insignificant influence on that of Gu-notexin. Unlike the effects noted with notexin, inactivation of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity by EDTA led to a reduction in the ability of Gu-notexin to induce EYPC/EYSM vesicle leakage and to increase Gu-notexin-induced membrane permeability of EYPC/EYSM/cholesterol vesicles. The geometrical arrangement of notexin and Gu-notexin in contact with either EYPC/EYSM vesicles or EYPC/EYSM/cholesterol vesicles differed. Moreover, global conformation of notexin and Gu-notexin differed in either Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound or metal-free states. These results indicate that notexin and Gu-notexin could induce membrane permeability without the involvement of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity, and suggest that guanidination alters the membrane-bound mode of notexin on damaging phospholipid vesicles containing sphingomyelin and cholesterol.</p>

				<title>The effect of contaminants on the adhesion of the spatulae of a gecko</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0595-0603</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many researchers have reported that the robust adhesion that enables geckos to move quickly and securely across a range of vertical and horizontal surfaces is provided by the hierarchical structure of their feet (i.e. lamellae, setae, spatulae, etc.). Maintaining this robust adhesion requires an intimate contact between the terminal tips of the spatulae and the surface. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the adhesive properties of the spatulae when a particle becomes trapped at the contact surface. Using the Johnson, Kendall and Roberts (JKR) theory, a model was constructed to assist in the analysis of the interactions between the spatula tip, the particle and the surface. The results showed that the keratin (the natural material of the spatula) provides a robust system for adhesion even when there is a particle in the contact area, and the effective contact area of spatulae will be 80%. When the particle is significantly harder than the surface, the adhesion properties of the contact surface influenced by the particle will be more obvious. The results also reveal that the generated adhesion is considerably higher when the spatula is in contact with a softer surface, such as wood or concrete, rather than a hard surface, such as glass or SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

				<title>Molecular variability analyses of <i>Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus</i> capsid protein</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0605-0615</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The complete sequences of the coat protein (CP) gene of 26 isolates of <i>Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus</i> (ACLSV) from India were determined. The isolates were obtained from various pome (apple, pear and quince) and stone (plum, peach, apricot, almond and wild Himalayan cherry) fruit trees. Other previously characterized ACLSV isolates and <i>Trichoviruses</i> were used for comparative analysis. Indian ACLSV isolates among themselves and with isolates from elsewhere in the world shared 91–100% and 70–98% sequence identities at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively. The highest degree of variability was observed in the middle portion with 9 amino acid substitutions in contrast to the N-terminal and C-terminal ends, which were maximally conserved with only 4 amino acid substitutions. In phylogenetic analysis no reasonable correlation between host species and/or geographic origin of the isolates was observed. Alignment with capsid protein genes of other <i>Trichoviruses</i> revealed the TaTao ACLSV peach isolate to be phylogenetically closest to <i>Peach mosaic virus, Apricot pseudo chlorotic leaf spot virus</i> and <i>Cherry mottle leaf virus</i>. Recombination analysis (RDP3 ver.2.6) done for all the available ACLSV complete CP sequences of the world and Indian isolates indicate no significant evidence of recombination. However, one recombination event among Indian ACLSV-CP isolates was detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of complete CP sequence variability study from India and also the first evidence of homologous recombination in ACLSV.</p>

				<title>Self-organizing maps: A tool to ascertain taxonomic relatedness based on features derived from 16S rDNA sequence</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0617-0627</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Exploitation of microbial wealth, of which almost 95% or more is still unexplored, is a growing need. The taxonomic placements of a new isolate based on phenotypic characteristics are now being supported by information preserved in the <i>16S rRNA</i> gene. However, the analysis of 16S rDNA sequences retrieved from metagenome, by the available bioinformatics tools, is subject to limitations. In this study, the occurrences of nucleotide features in 16S rDNA sequences have been used to ascertain the taxonomic placement of organisms. The tetra- and penta-nucleotide features were extracted from the training data set of the 16S rDNA sequence, and was subjected to an artificial neural network (ANN) based tool known as self-organizing map (SOM), which helped in visualization of unsupervised classification. For selection of significant features, principal component analysis (PCA) or curvilinear component analysis (CCA) was applied. The SOM along with these techniques could discriminate the sample sequences with more than 90% accuracy, highlighting the relevance of features. To ascertain the confidence level in the developed classification approach, the test data set was specifically evaluated for <i>Thiobacillus</i>, with <i>Acidiphilium, Paracocus</i> and <i>Starkeya</i>, which are taxonomically reassigned. The evaluation proved the excellent generalization capability of the developed tool. The topology of genera in SOM supported the conventional chemo-biochemical classification reported in the Bergey manual.</p>

				<title>Male mate location behaviour and encounter sites in a community of tropical butterflies: taxonomic and site associations and distinctions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0629-0646</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Male mate location behaviour and encounter sites have been studied in 72 butterfly species at Nagpur, India, and related to taxonomy, morphology, habitat and population parameters. Species can be placed in three broad classes of mate location behaviour: invariant patrolling, invariant perching, and perch-patrol, the latter associated with increasing site fidelity, territorial defence and male assemblages. Significant taxonomic differences occur, closely related species tending to share mate location behaviours. Morphological differences are found with heavier and larger butterflies displaying greater site fidelity and territorial defence, and differences occur between individuals of species which both perch and patrol. Invariant patrolling is particularly associated with tracks through vegetation, host plant-track distributions, and high female to male numbers observed on transects; invariant perching is linked more to edge features than patrolling, and to lower population counts on transects. Species which perch-patrol, defend territories and establish male assemblages are associated with more complex vegetation structures, and have encounter sites at vegetation edges, landforms and predictable resource (host plant) concentrations. Attention is drawn to the importance of distinctive mate encounter sites for the conservation of butterfly species’ habitats.</p>

				<title>Epigenetic modulation of host: new insights into immune evasion by viruse</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0647-0663</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Viruses have evolved with their hosts, which include all living species. This has been partly responsible for the development of highly advanced immune systems in the hosts. However, viruses too have evolved ways to regulate and evade the host’s immune defence. In addition to mutational mechanisms that viruses employ to mimic the host genome and undergo latency to evade the host’s recognition of the pathogen, they have also developed epigenetic mechanisms by which they can render the host’s immune responses inactive to their antigens. The epigenetic regulation of gene expression is intrinsically active inside the host and is involved in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation. Viral immune evasion strategies are an area of major concern in modern biomedical research. Immune evasion strategies may involve interference with the host antigen presentation machinery or host immune gene expression capabilities, and viruses, in these manners, introduce and propagate infection. The aim of this review is to elucidate the various epigenetic changes that viruses are capable of bringing about in their host in order to enhance their own survivability and pathogenesis.</p>

				<title>Glycan changes: cancer metastasis and anti-cancer vaccines</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0665-0673</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Complex carbohydrates, which are major components of the cell membrane, perform important functions in cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions, as well as in signal transduction. They comprise three kinds of biomolecules: glycoproteins, proteoglycans and glycosphingolipids. Recent studies have also shown that glycan changes in malignant cells take a variety of forms and mediate key pathophysiological events during the various stages of tumour progression. Glycosylation changes are universal hallmarks of malignant transformation and tumour progression in human cancer, which take place on the whole cells or some specific molecules. Accordingly, those changes make them prominent candidates for cancer biomarkers in the meantime. This review mainly focuses on the correlation between glycosylation and the metastasis potential of tumour cells from comprehensive aspects to further address the vital roles of glycans in oncogenesising. Moreover, utilizing these glycosylation changes to ward off tumour metastasis by means of anti-adhesion approach or devising anti-cancer vaccine is one of promising targets of future study.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present study assessed the efficacy of a heat-inducible <i>cre</i> gene for conditional removal of the marker gene from a rice genome via Cre-<i>lox</i> recombination. A <i>cre</i> gene controlled by the soybean heat-shock promoter was introduced into the rice genome along with the recombination target (<i>lox</i>) construct. Cre-mediated recombination was expected to remove the marker gene and activate the promoter-less <i>GUS</i> gene. Six transgenic lines displayed well-regulated heat-inducible Cre activity in the callus. However, only one line that contained a single copy of the <i>cre</i> gene maintained this property in the regenerated plants and their progeny. Marker-free progeny were obtained from the plant that was heat-treated at the seedling stage, indicating the inheritance of the recombination `footprint’. The presence of the `footprint’ was verified by polymerase chain reaction and Southern analysis. Therefore, the <i>cre</i> gene controlled by the soybean heat-shock promoter is an effective tool for conditional removal of the marker gene in rice.</p>

				<title>Effects of substitutions at position 180 in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA polymerase 𝛼<sup>70</sup> subunit</title>

				<page>0043-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to investigate the role of His180 residue, located in the non-conserved region of the 𝜎<sup>70</sup> subunit of <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA polymerase, two mutant variants of the protein with substitutions for either alanine or glutamic acid were constructed and purified using the IMPACT system. The ability of mutant 𝜎<sup>70</sup> subunits to interact with core RNA polymerase was investigated using native gel-electrophoresis. The properties of the corresponding reconstituted holoenzymes, as provided by gel shift analysis of their complexes with single- and double-stranded promoter-like DNA and by <i>in vitro</i> transcription experiments, allowed one to deduce that His180 influences several steps of transcription initiation, including core binding, promoter DNA recognition and open complex formation.</p>

				<title>Antipathogenic potential of marine <i>Bacillus</i> sp. SS4 on <i>N</i>-acyl-homoserine-lactone-mediated virulence factors production in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PAO1)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0055-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Antipathogenic therapy is an outcome of the quorum-sensing inhibition (QSI) mechanism, which targets autoinducer-dependent virulent gene expression in bacterial pathogens. 𝑁-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) acts as a key regulator in the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PAO1 and violacein pigment production in <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i>. In the present study, the marine bacterial strain SS4 showed potential QSI activity in a concentration-dependent manner (0.5–2 mg/ml) against the AHL-mediated violacein production in <i>C. violaceum</i> (33–86%) and biofilm formation (33–88%), total protease (20–65%), LasA protease (59–68%), LasB elastase (36–68%), pyocyanin (17–86%) and pyoverdin productions in PAO1. The light and confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses confirmed the reduction of the biofilm-forming ability of PAO1 when treated with SS4 extract. Furthermore, the antibiofilm potential was confirmed through static biofilm ring assay, in which ethyl acetate extract of SS4 showed concentration-dependent reduction in the biofilm-forming ability of PAO1. Thus, the result of this study clearly reveals the antipathogenic and antibiofilm properties of the bacterial isolate SS4. Through 16S rDNA analysis, the strain SS4 was identified as <i>Bacillus</i> sp. (GenBank Accession Number: GU471751).</p>

				<title>Is endothelial-nitric-oxide-synthase-derived nitric oxide involved in cardiac hypoxia/reoxygenation-related damage?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0069-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to act both as a destructive and a protective agent in the pathogenesis of the injuries that occur during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). It has been suggested that this dual role of NO depends directly on the isoform of NO synthase (NOS) involved. In this work, we investigate the role that NO derived from endothelial NOS (eNOS) plays in cardiac H/R-induced injury.Wistar rats were submitted to H/R (hypoxia for 30 min; reoxygenation of 0 h, 12 h and 5 days), with or without prior treatment using the selective eNOS inhibitor L-NIO (20 mg/kg). Lipid peroxidation, apoptosis and protein nitration, as well as NO production (NOx), were analysed. The results showed that L-NIO administration lowered NOx levels in all the experimental groups. However, no change was found in the lipid peroxidation level, the percentage of apoptotic cells or nitrated protein expression, implying that eNOS-derived NO may not be involved in the injuries occurring during H/R in the heart. We conclude that L-NIO would not be useful in alleviating the adverse effects of cardiac H/R.</p>

				<title>Requirements of Slm proteins for proper eisosome organization, endocytic trafficking and recycling in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0079-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eisosomes are large immobile assemblies at the cortex of a cell under the membrane compartment of Can1 (MCC) in yeast. Slm1 has recently been identified as an MCC component that acts downstream of Mss4 in a pathway that regulates actin cytoskeleton organization in response to stress. In this study, we showed that inactivation of Slm proteins disrupts proper localization of the primary eisosome marker Pil1, providing evidence that Slm proteins play a role in eisosome organization. Furthermore, we found that <i>slm</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> mutant cells exhibit actin defects in both the ability to polarize cortical F-actin and the formation of cytoplasmic actin cables even at the permissive temperature (30&#176;C). We further demonstrated that the actin defect accounts for the slow traffic of FM4-64-labelled endosome in the cytoplasm, supporting the notion that intact actin is essential for endosome trafficking. However, our real-time microscopic analysis of Abp1-RFP revealed that the actin defect in <i>slm</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> cells was not accompanied by a noticeable defect in actin patch internalization during receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, we found that <i>slm</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> cells displayed impaired membrane recycling and that recycling occurred in an actin-independent manner. Our data provide evidence for the requirement of Slm proteins in eisosome organization and endosome trafficking and recycling.</p>

Experiments on cellular cultures subject to increasing concentrations of ferric ions were conducted in order to study the effect of oxidative stress on the dynamics of the fermentative process. The developed mathematical model was able to simulate the cellular activity, the metabolic yield and the main metabolic fluxes occurring during fermentation and to describe how these are modulated by the presence of ferric ions.</p>

				<title>Processing of abasic DNA clusters in hApeI-silenced primary fibroblasts exposed to low doses of X-irradiation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0105-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clustered damage in DNA includes two or more closely spaced oxidized bases, strand breaks or abasic sites that are induced by high- or low-linear-energy-transfer (LET) radiation, and these have been found to be repair-resistant and potentially mutagenic. In the present study we found that abasic clustered damages are also induced in primary human fibroblast cells by low-LET X-rays even at very low doses. In response to the induction of the abasic sites, primary fibroblasts irradiated by low doses of X-rays in the range 10–100 cGy showed dose-dependent up-regulation of the DNA repair enzyme, ApeI. We found that the abasic clusters in primary fibroblasts were more lethal to cells when hApeI enzyme expression was down-regulated by transfecting primary fibroblasts with hApeI siRNA as determined by clonogenic survival assay. Endonuclease activity of hApeI was found to be directly proportional to hApeI gene-silencing efficiency. The DNA repair profile showed that processing of abasic clusters was delayed in hApeI-siRNA-silenced fibroblasts, which challenges the survival of the cells even at very low doses of X-rays. Thus, the present study is the first to attempt to understand the induction of cluster DNA damage at very low doses of low-LET radiation in primary human fibroblasts and their processing by DNA repair enzyme ApeI and their relation with the survival of the cells.</p>

				<title>Efficiency of wear and decalcification technique for estimating the age of estuarine dolphin <i>Sotalia guianensis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0117-0121</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most techniques used for estimating the age of <i>Sotalia guianensis</i> (van Bénéden, 1864) (Cetacea; Delphinidae) are very expensive, and require sophisticated equipment for preparing histological sections of teeth. The objective of this study was to test a more affordable and much simpler method, involving of the manual wear of teeth followed by decalcification and observation under a stereomicroscope. This technique has been employed successfully with larger species of Odontoceti. Twenty-six specimens were selected, and one tooth of each specimen was worn and demineralized for growth layers reading. Growth layers were evidenced in all specimens; however, in 4 of the 26 teeth, not all the layers could be clearly observed. In these teeth, there was a significant decrease of growth layer group thickness, thus hindering the layers count. The juxtaposition of layers hindered the reading of larger numbers of layers by the wear and decalcification technique. Analysis of more than 17 layers in a single tooth proved inconclusive. The method applied here proved to be efficient in estimating the age of <i>Sotalia guianensis</i> individuals younger than 18 years. This method could simplify the study of the age structure of the overall population, and allows the use of the more expensive methodologies to be confined to more specific studies of older specimens. It also enables the classification of the calf, young and adult classes, which is important for general population studies.</p>

				<title>HrpN<i>Ea</i> -induced deterrent effect on phloem feeding of the green peach aphid <i>Myzus persicae</i> requires <i>AtGSL5</i> and <i>AtMYB44</i> genes in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0123-0137</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<i>Arabidopsis</i>) treated with the harpin protein HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>, resistance to the green peach aphid <i>Myzus persicae</i>, a generalist phloem-feeding insect, develops with induced expression of the <i>AtMYB44</i> gene. Special <i>GLUCAN SYNTHESIS-LIKE</i> (<i>GSL</i>) genes and 𝛽-1,3-glucan callose play an important role in plant defence responses to attacks by phloem-feeding insects. Here we report that <i>AtGLS5</i> and <i>AtMYB44</i> are both required for HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>-induced repression of <i>M. persicae</i> feeding from the phloem of <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves. In 24 h successive surveys on large-scale aphid populations, the proportion of feeding aphids was much smaller in HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>-treated plants than in control plants, and aphids preferred to feed from the 37 tested <i>atgsl</i> mutants rather than the wild-type plant. The <i>atgsl</i> mutants were generated previously by mutagenesis in 12 identified <i>AtGSL</i> genes (<i>AtGSL1</i> through <i>AtGSL12</i>); in the 24 h survey, both <i>atgsl5</i> and <i>atgsl6</i> tolerated aphid feeding, and <i>atgsl5</i> was the most tolerant. Consistently, <i>atgsl5</i> was also most inhibitive to the deterrent effect of HrpN<sub>Ea</sub> on the phloem-feeding activity of aphids as monitored by the electrical penetration graph technique. These results suggested an important role of the <i>AtGSL5</i> gene in the effect of HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>. In response to HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>, <i>AtGSL5</i> expression and callose deposition were induced in the wild-type plant but not in <i>atgsl5</i>. In response to HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>, moreover, the <i>AtMYB44</i> gene known to be required for repression of aphid reproduction on the plant was also required for repression of the phloem-feeding activity. Small amounts of the <i>AtGSL5</i> transcript and callose deposition were detected in the <i>atmyb44</i> mutant, as in <i>atgsl5</i>. Both mutants performed similarly in tolerating the phloem-feeding activity and impairing the deterrent effect of HrpN<sub>Ea</sub>, suggesting that <i>AtGSL5</i> and <i>AtMYB44</i> both contributed to the effect.</p>

				<title>Overexpression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase gene <i>OsMAPK33</i> enhances sensitivity to salt stress in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0139-0151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling cascades are activated by extracellular stimuli such as environmental stresses and pathogens in higher eukaryotic plants. To know more about MAPK signalling in plants, a MAPK cDNA clone, <i>OsMAPK33</i>, was isolated from rice. The gene is mainly induced by drought stress. In phylogenetic analysis, <i>OsMAPK33</i> (Os02g0148100) showed approximately 47–93% identity at the amino acid level with other plant MAPKs. It was found to exhibit organ-specific expression with relatively higher expression in leaves as compared with roots or stems, and to exist as a single copy in the rice genome. To investigate the biological functions of <i>OsMAPK33</i> in rice MAPK signalling, transgenic rice plants that either overexpressed or suppressed <i>OsMAPK33</i> were made. Under dehydration conditions, the suppressed lines showed lower osmotic potential compared with that of wild-type plants, suggesting a role of <i>OsMAPK33</i> in osmotic homeostasis. Nonetheless, the suppressed lines did not display any significant difference in drought tolerance compared with their wild-type plants. With increased salinity, there was still no difference in salt tolerance between <i>OsMAPK33</i>-suppressed lines and their wild-type plants. However, the overexpressing lines showed greater reduction in biomass accumulation and higher sodium uptake into cells, resulting in a lower K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio inside the cell than that in the wild-type plants and <i>OsMAPK33</i>-suppressed lines. These results suggest that <i>OsMAPK33</i> could play a negative role in salt tolerance through unfavourable ion homeostasis. Gene expression profiling of <i>OsMAPK33</i> transgenic lines through rice DNA chip analysis showed that <i>OsMAPK33</i> altered expression of genes involved in ion transport. Further characterization of downstream components will elucidate various biological functions of this novel rice MAPK.</p>

				<title>RNA interference for the control of whiteflies (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i>) by oral route</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0153-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing was explored for the control of sap-sucking pest <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, commonly known as whitefly. dsRNAs and siRNAs were synthesized from five different genes – actin ortholog, ADP/ATP translocase, 𝛼-tubulin, ribosomal protein L9 (RPL9) and V-ATPase A subunit. A simplified insect bioassay method was developed for the delivery of ds/siRNA through the oral route, and efficacy was evaluated. ds/siRNA caused 29–97% mortality after 6 days of feeding. Each insect ingested nearly 150 nl of insect diet per day, which contained a maximum of 6 ng of RNA. Knocking down the expression of RPL9 and V-ATPase A caused higher mortality with LC<sub>50</sub> 11.21 and 3.08 𝜇g/ml, respectively, as compared to other genes. Semi-quantitative PCR of the treated insects showed significant decrease in the level of RPL9 and V-ATPase A transcripts. siRNAs were found stable in the insect diet for at least 7 days at the room temperature. Phloem-specific expression of dsRNAs of RPL9 and V-ATPase A in transgenic plants for the protection against whiteflies might be an interesting application of this technology.</p>

				<title>Ascorbic acid is a key participant during the interactions between chloroplasts and mitochondria to optimize photosynthesis and protect against photoinhibition</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0163-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The possible role of L-ascorbate (AsA) as a biochemical signal during the interactions between photosynthesis and respiration was examined in leaf discs of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. AsA content was either decreased as in AsA-deficient <i>vtc1</i> mutants or increased by treatment with L-galactono-1, 4-lactone (L-GalL, a precursor of AsA; EC 1.3.2.3). In mutants, photosynthesis was extremely sensitive to both antimycin A (inhibitor of the cytochrome 𝑐 oxidase pathway [COX pathway]) and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, inhibitor of the alternative pathway [AOX pathway]), particularly at high light conditions. Mitochondrial inhibitors lowered the ratio of reduced AsA to total AsA, at high light, indicating oxidative stress in leaf discs. Elevation of AsA by L-GalL decreased the sensitivity of photosynthesis at high light to antimycin A or SHAM, sustained photosynthesis at supraoptimal light and relieved the extent of photoinhibition. High ratios of reduced AsA to total AsA in L-GalL-treated leaf discs suggests that L-GalL lowers oxidative stress. The protection by L-GalL of photosynthesis against the mitochondrial inhibitors and photoinhibition was quite pronounced in <i>vtc1</i> mutants. Our results suggest that the levels and redox state of AsA modify the pattern of modulation of photosynthesis by mitochondrial metabolism. The extent of the AOX pathway as a percentage of the total respiration in <i>Arabidopsis</i> mesophyll protoplasts was much higher in <i>vtc1</i> than in wild type. We suggest that the role of AsA becomes pronounced at high light and/or when the AOX pathway is inhibited. While acknowledging the importance of the COX pathway, we hypothesize that AsA and the AOX pathway may complement each other to protect photosynthesis against photoinhibition.</p>

				<title>Antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity factors in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> isolated from mastitic Sahiwal cattle</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0175-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus</i> aureus (MRSA) poses a serious problem in dairy animals suffering from mastitis. In the present study, the distribution of mastitic MRSA and antibiotic resistance was studied in 107 strains of <i>S. aureus</i> isolated from milk samples from 195 infected udders. The characterizations pathogenic factors (adhesin and toxin genes) and antibiotic susceptibility of isolates were carried out using gene amplification and disc diffusion assays, respectively. A high prevalence of MRSA was observed in the tested isolates (13.1%). The isolates were also highly resistant to antibiotics, i.e. 36.4% were resistant to streptomycin, 33.6% to oxytetracycline, 29.9% to gentamicin and 26.2% each to chloramphenicol, pristinomycin and ciprofloxacin. A significant variation in the expression of pathogenic factors (<i>Ig, coa</i> and <i>clf</i>) was observed in these isolates. The overall distribution of adhesin genes <i>ebp, fib, bbp, fnbB, cap5, cap8, map</i> and <i>cna</i> in the isolates was found to be 69.1, 67.2, 6.5, 20.5, 60.7, 26.1, 81.3 and 8.4%, respectively. The presence of <i>fib, fnb</i>B, <i>bbp</i> and <i>map</i> genes was considerably greater in MRSA than in methicillin-susceptible <i>S. aureus</i> (MSSA) isolates. The proportions of toxin genes, namely, <i>hlb, seb, sec, sed, seg</i> and <i>sei</i>, in the isolates were found to be 94.3, 0.9, 8.4, 0.9, 10.2 and 49.5%, respectively. The proportions of <i>agr</i> genes I, II, III and IV were found to be 39.2, 27.1, 21.5 and 12.1%, respectively. A few isolates showed similar antibiotic-resistance patterns, which could be due to identical strains or the dissemination of the same strains among animals. These findings can be utilized in mastitis treatment programmes and antimicrobials strategies in organized herds.</p>

				<title>P1 peptidase – a mysterious protein of family Potyviridae</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0189-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Potyviridae family, named after its type member, <i>Potato virus Y</i> (PVY), is the largest of the 65 plant virus groups and families currently recognized. The coding region for P1 peptidase is located at the very beginning of the viral genome of the family Potyviridae. Until recently P1 was thought of as serine peptidase with RNA-binding activity and with possible influence in cell-to-cell viral spreading. This N-terminal protein, among all of the potyviruses, is the most divergent protein: varying in length and in its amino acid sequence. Nevertheless, P1 peptidase in many ways is still a mysterious viral protein. In this review, we would like to offer a comprehensive overview, discussing the proteomic, biochemical and phylogenetic views of the P1 protein.</p>

				<title>Towards hemerythrin-based blood substitutes: Comparative performance to hemoglobin on human leukocytes and umbilical vein endothelial cells</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0215-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hemerythrin is a dioxygen-carrying protein whose oxidative/nitrosative stress-related reactivity is lower than that of hemoglobin, which may warrant investigation of hemerythrin as raw material for artificial oxygen carriers (‘blood substitutes’). We report here the first biological tests for hemerythrin and its chemical derivatives, comparing their performance with that of a representative competitor, glutaraldehyde-polymerized bovine hemoglobin. Hemerythrin (native or derivatized) exhibits a proliferative effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures, as opposed to a slight inhibitory effect of hemoglobin. A similar positive effect is displayed on human lymphocytes by glutaraldehyde-polymerized hemerythrin, but not by native or polyethylene glycol-derivatized hemerythrin.</p>

				<title>Isolation and expression analysis of LEA genes in peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0223-0228</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein family is a large protein family that includes proteins accumulated at late stages of seed development or in vegetative tissues in response to drought, salinity, cold stress and exogenous application of abscisic acid. In order to isolate peanut genes, an expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing project was carried out using a peanut seed cDNA library. From 6258 ESTs, 19 LEA-encoding genes were identified and could be classified into eight distinct groups. Expression of these genes in seeds at different developmental stages and in various peanut tissues was analysed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that expression levels of LEA genes were generally high in seeds. Some LEA protein genes were expressed at a high level in non-seed tissues such as root, stem, leaf, flower and gynophore. These results provided valuable information for the functional and regulatory studies on peanut LEA genes.</p>

				<title>Stylish lengths: Mate choice in flowers</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0229-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The styles of flowers may represent an arena for pollen competition in the race to fertilize ovules. Accordingly, selection should favour a longer ‘race’ to better discriminate among variable pollen by increasing style length. Sampling across a taxonomically diverse range of wild and outcrossed species, we found that the distribution of style lengths within plants were skewed towards longer styles, as predicted. In self-pollinated domesticated species, where discrimination among pollen is less important, we found no such pattern. We conclude that style length is under directional selection towards longer styles as a mechanism for mate choice among pollen of variable quality.</p>

				<title>Effects of gamma-ray-induced free radicals on the metal content and amino acid composition of human metallothionein-1</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0235-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metallothioneins (MTs), a low-mass class of metalloproteins, are characterized by a high thiolate sulphur and metal content. MTs are involved in metal homeostasis and heavy metal detoxification, and are efficient scavengers of free radicals. This article describes zinc release from human MT-1 and modification of its amino acid composition when subjected to free radicals generated during gamma ray radiolysis. The effect of gamma ray radiolysis of untreated and metal-depleted human MT-1 was tested under multiple aerobic and anaerobic conditions at increasing irradiation doses. Under all conditions, a rapid increase of serine in the early stages of irradiation was observed. Irradiation for longer times led to cysteic acid formation, except under argon atmosphere. Several other amino acid concentrations gradually decreased. Formation of limited amounts of hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine and ornithine as well as some less common derivatives such as cystathionine occurred as side-effects.</p>

				<title>Effect of surgical stress on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from healthy sections of colon and rectum of patients with colorectal cancer</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0243-0251</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surgical resection at any location in the body leads to stress response with cellular and subcellular change, leading to tissue damage. The intestine is extremely sensitive to surgical stress with consequent postoperative complications. It has been suggested that the increase of reactive oxygen species as subcellular changes plays an important role in this process. This article focuses on the effect of surgical stress on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from healthy sections of colon and rectum of patients with colorectal cancer. Mitochondrial DNA copy number, mitochondrial common deletion and nuclear and mitochondrial 8-oxo-2&#8242;-deoxyguanosine content were measured. Both the colon and rectal tissue were significantly damaged either at the nuclear or mitochondrial level. In particular, mitochondrial DNA was more damaged in rectum than in colon. The present investigation found an association between surgical stress and nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage, suggesting that surgery may generate an increase in free radicals, which trigger a cascade of molecular changes, including alterations in DNA.</p>

				<title>Water-mediated ionic interactions in protein structures</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0253-0263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known that water molecules play an indispensable role in the structure and function of biological macromolecules. The water-mediated ionic interactions between the charged residues provide stability and plasticity and in turn address the function of the protein structures. Thus, this study specifically addresses the number of possible water-mediated ionic interactions, their occurrence, distribution and nature found in 90% non-redundant protein chains. Further, it provides a statistical report of different charged residue pairs that are mediated by surface or buried water molecules to form the interactions. Also, it discusses its contributions in stabilizing various secondary structural elements of the protein. Thus, the present study shows the ubiquitous nature of the interactions that imparts plasticity and flexibility to a protein molecule.</p>

				<title>Pleiotropic consequences of misexpression of the developmentally active and stress-inducible non-coding <i>hsr</i>𝜔 gene in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0265-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The non-coding <i>hsr</i>𝜔 gene of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is expressed in nearly all cell types and developmental stages. However, in the absence of conventional mutant alleles of this gene, its developmental functions remain largely unknown. In the present study, we used a variety of GAL4 drivers to overexpress or ablate this gene’s transcripts in specific tissues and examined the developmental consequences thereof. Our results show that a balanced expression of these non-coding transcripts is critical for survival and normal development in all the tissue types tested, since any change in cellular levels of these transcripts in a given cell type generally has detrimental effects, with extreme cases resulting in organismal lethality, although in a few cases the misexpression of these transcripts also suppresses the mutant phenotype due to other genetic conditions. Evidence is also presented for existence of a new spliced variant of the hsr𝜔-n nuclear transcript. Following the RNAi-mediated down-regulation of hsr𝜔 transcripts, the omega speckles disappear so that the nucleoplasmic hnRNPs get diffusely distributed, while upregulation of these transcripts results in greater sequestration of these proteins into omega speckle clusters; either of these conditions would affect activities of the hnRNPs and other hsr𝜔-RNA interacting proteins, which is likely to have cascading consequences. The present findings, together with our earlier observations on effects of altered levels of the hsr𝜔 transcripts on induced apoptosis and expanded polyQ-mediated neurodegeneration, further confirm that ncRNA species like the hsr𝜔, far from being evolutionary hangovers, provide critical information for important functions in normal cells.</p>

				<title>Splicing aberrations caused by constitutional <i>RB1</i> gene mutations in retinoblastoma</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0281-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analysis of RB1 mRNA from blood leukocytes of patients with retinoblastoma identified the effects of mutations involving consensus splice site, exonic substitution and whole-exon deletions identified in genomic DNA of these patients. In addition, this study identified mutations in cases in which no mutations were detectable in the genomic DNA. One proband had mutation at the canonical splice site at +5 position of IVS22, and analysis of the transcripts in this family revealed skipping of exon 22 in three members of this family. In one proband, a missense substitution of c.652T &#62; G (g.56897T &#62; G; Leu218Val) in exon 7 led to splicing aberrations involving deletions of exons 7 and 8, suggesting the formation of a cryptic splice site. In two probands with no detectable changes in the genomic DNA upon screening of RB1 exons and flanking intronic sequences, transcripts were found to have deletions of exon 6 in one, and exons 21 and 22 in another family. In two probands, RNA analysis confirmed genomic deletions involving one or more exons. This study reveals novel effects of RB1 mutations on splicing and suggests the utility of RNA analysis as an adjunct to mutational screening of genomic DNA in retinoblastoma.</p>

				<title>Genome-wide screening reveals the emergence and divergence of RTK homologues in basal Metazoan <i>Hydra magnipapillata</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0289-0296</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are key components of cell–cell signalling required for growth and development of multicellular organisms. It is therefore likely that the divergence of RTKs and associated components played a significant role in the evolution of multicellular organisms. We have carried out the present study in hydra, a diploblast, to investigate the divergence of RTKs after parazoa and before emergence of triploblast phyla. The domain-based screening using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for RTKs in Genomescan predicted gene models of the <i>Hydra magnipapillata</i> genome resulted in identification of 15 RTKs. These RTKs have been classified into eight families based on domain architecture and homology. Only 5 of these RTKs have been previously reported and a few of these have been partially characterized. A phylogeny-based analysis of these predicted RTKs revealed that seven subtype duplications occurred between `parazoan–eumetazoan split’ and `diploblast–triploblast split’ in animal phyla. These results suggest that most of the RTKs evolved before the radiata–bilateria divergence during animal evolution.</p>

				<title>Growth inhibitory, apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities displayed by a novel modified triterpenoid, cyano enone of methyl boswellates</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0297-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Triterpenoids are pentacyclic secondary metabolites present in many terrestrial plants. Natural triterpenoids have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities. Here, we show that modifications of ring A of boswellic acid (2 cyano, 3 enone) resulted in a highly active growth inhibitory, anti-inflammatory, prodifferentiative and anti-tumour triterpenoid compound called cyano enone of methyl boswellates (CEMB). This compound showed cytotoxic activity on a number of cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 𝜇M. CEMB inhibits DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis in A549 cell line at 0.25 𝜇M and 1 𝜇M concentrations, respectively. CEMB induces adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells at a concentration of 0.1 𝜇M. Finally, administration of CEMB intra-tumourally significantly inhibited the growth of C6 glioma tumour xenograft in immuno-compromised mice. Collectively, these results suggest that CEMB is a very potent anti-tumour compound.</p>

				<title>Modulation of synaptic potentials and cell excitability by dendritic K<i>IR</i> and K<i>AS</i> channels in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons: A computational study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0309-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical structure of the brain reward circuit, is implicated in normal goal-directed behaviour and learning as well as pathological conditions like schizophrenia and addiction. Its major cellular substrates, the medium spiny (MS) neurons, possess a wide variety of dendritic active conductances that may modulate the excitatory post synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and cell excitability. We examine this issue using a biophysically detailed 189-compartment stylized model of the NAc MS neuron, incorporating all the known active conductances. We find that, of all the active channels, inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>IR</sub>) channels play the primary role in modulating the resting membrane potential (RMP) and EPSPs in the down-state of the neuron. Reduction in the conductance of K<sub>IR</sub> channels evokes facilitatory effects on EPSPs accompanied by rises in local input resistance and membrane time constant. At depolarized membrane potentials closer to up-state levels, the slowly inactivating A-type potassium channel (K<sub>As</sub>) conductance also plays a strong role in determining synaptic potential parameters and cell excitability. We discuss the implications of our results for the regulation of accumbal MS neuron biophysics and synaptic integration by intrinsic factors and extrinsic agents such as dopamine.</p>

				<title>Mutagenesis in ORF AV2 affects viral replication in <i>Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus</i></title>

				<page>0329-0340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus</i> (MYMIV) is a whitefly-transmitted begomovirus with a bipartite genome. We investigate the functions of the MYMIV-AV2 protein, the open reading frame present upstream of the coat protein gene in DNA A component. The ability of MYMIV-AV2 mutants to replicate, spread and cause symptoms in legume hosts, blackgram, cowpea and French bean was analysed. Plants agroinoculated with mutants K73R, C86S and the double mutant C84S, C86S showed increase in severity of symptoms compared with the wild type. However, mutants W2S and H14Q,G15E caused marked attenuation of symptoms. While the double mutants C84S,C86S caused a 50-fold increase in double-stranded supercoiled and single-stranded DNA accumulation, the mutations W2S and H14Q,G15E showed a decrease in double-stranded supercoiled and single-stranded viral DNA accumulation. Because AV2 mutants affect the ratio between open circular and supercoiled DNA forms, we hypothesize that these mutations may modulate the functions of the replication initiation protein.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The peptide fragments obtained by cathepsin digestion of purified buffalo prolactin (buPRL) monomer have been characterized using SDS-PAGE and FPLC with regard to size and pI. Their antiangiogenic activity was tested in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and the human endothelial cells wound healing assay. Antiangiogenic activity was observed in cathepsin-cleaved fragments from buPRL. Further, a peptide sequence 45A-46Q-47G-48K-49G-50F-51I-52T-53M-54A-55L-56N-57S-58C, which matched with human somatostatin (hSST), a known antiangiogenic factor, was located in the second loop between the first and second α-helices in the threedimensional structure of buPRL, obtained by homology modelling. The synthetic peptide matching with SST sequence was found to exhibit antiangiogenic activity in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> assays. It was also observed that all the peptides related to buPRL could antagonize the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bradykinin (BK)-dependent production of endothelial nitric oxide (NO), which is a pre-requisite for endothelial tube formation. It is concluded therefore that an internal sequence in buPRL and peptide fragments derived from cathepsin-digested buPRL exhibit antiangiogenic activities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A fibrinogenolytic toxin of molecular weight 6.5 kDa has been purified from the venom of Indian monocled cobra (<i>Naja kaouthia</i>) by repeated cation exchange chromatography on CM-sephadex C-50. The purified toxin did not show any phospholipase activity but was mildly hemolytic on human erythrocytes. This toxin, called Lahirin, cleaved fibrinogen in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The digestion process apparently started with the A𝛼 chain, and gradually other lower-molecular-weight chains were also cleaved to low-molecular-weight peptides. The fibrinolytic activity was completely lost after treatment with ethylene di-amine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). However, exposure to 100&#176;C for 1 min or pre-treatment with phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) did not affect the fibrinolytic activity. Cleavage of di-sulphide bonds by 𝛽-mercaptoethanol or unfolding the protein with 4 M urea caused complete loss of activity of pure Lahirin.</p>

				<title>Detrimental effect of expression of<i>Bt</i> endotoxin Cry1Ac on <i>in vitro</i> regeneration, <i>in vivo</i> growth and development of tobacco and cotton transgenics</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0363-0376</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High levels of expression of the <i>cry1Ac</i> gene from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> cannot be routinely achieved in transgenic plants despite modifications made in the gene to improve its expression. This has been attributed to the instability of the transcript in a few reports. In the present study, based on the genetic transformation of cotton and tobacco, we show that the expression of the Cry1Ac endotoxin has detrimental effects on both the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> growth and development of transgenic plants. A number of experiments on developing transgenics in cotton with different versions of <i>cry1Ac</i> gene showed that the majority of the plants did not express any Cry1Ac protein. Based on Southern blot analysis, it was also observed that a substantial number of lines did not contain the <i>cry1Ac</i> gene cassette although they contained the marker gene <i>nptII</i>. More significantly, all the lines that showed appreciable levels of expression were found to be phenotypically abnormal. Experiments on transformation of tobacco with different constructs expressing the <i>cry1Ac</i> gene showed that <i>in vitro</i> regeneration was inhibited by the encoded protein. Further, out of a total of 145 independent events generated with the different <i>cry1Ac</i> gene constructs in tobacco, only 21 showed expression of the Cry1Ac protein, confirming observations made in cotton that regenerants that express high levels of the Cry1Ac protein are selected against during regeneration of transformed events. This problem was circumvented by targeting the Cry1Ac protein to the chloroplast, which also significantly improved the expression of the protein.</p>

				<title>Metabolic and molecular action of <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i> (fenugreek) and trace metals in experimental diabetic tissues</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0383-0396</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycaemia resulting in defective insulin secretion, resistance to insulin action or both. The use of biguanides, sulphonylurea and other drugs are valuable in the treatment of diabetes mellitus; their use, however, is restricted by their limited action, pharmaco-kinetic properties, secondary failure rates and side effects. <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i>, commonly known as fenugreek, is a plant that has been extensively used as a source of antidiabetic compounds from its seeds and leaf extracts. Preliminary human trials and animal experiments suggest possible hypoglycaemic and anti-hyperlipedemic properties of fenugreek seed powder taken orally. Our results show that the action of fenugreek in lowering blood glucose levels is almost comparable to the effect of insulin. Combination with trace metal showed that vanadium had additive effects and manganese had additive effects with insulin on <i>in vitro</i> system in control and diabetic animals of young and old ages using adipose tissue. The <i>Trigonella</i> and vanadium effects were studied in a number of tissues including liver, kidney, brain peripheral nerve, heart, red blood cells and skeletal muscle. Addition of <i>Trigonella</i> to vanadium significantly removed the toxicity of vanadium when used to reduce blood glucose levels. Administration of the various combinations of the antidiabetic compounds to diabetic animals was found to reverse most of the diabetic effects studied at physiological, biochemical, histochemical and molecular levels. Results of the key enzymes of metabolic pathways have been summarized together with glucose transporter, Glut-4 and insulin levels. Our findings illustrate and elucidate the antidiabetic/insulin mimetic effects of <i>Trigonella</i>, manganese and vanadium.</p>

				<title>The Chriz–Z4 complex recruits JIL-1 to polytene chromosomes, a requirement for interband-specific phosphorylation of H3S10</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0425-0438</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The conserved band-interband pattern is thought to reflect the looped-domain organization of insect polytene chromosomes. Previously, we have shown that the chromodomain protein Chriz and the zinc-finger protein Z4 are essentially required for the maintenance of polytene chromosome structure. Here we show that both proteins form a complex that recruits the JIL-1 kinase to polytene chromosomes, enabling local H3S10 phosphorylation of interband nucleosomal histones. Interband targeting domains were identified at the N-terminal regions of Chriz and Z4, and our data suggest partial cooperation of the complex with the BEAF boundary element protein in polytene and diploid cells. Reducing the core component Chriz by RNAi results in destabilization of the complex and a strong reduction of interband-specific histone H3S10 phosphorylation.</p>

				<title>Dynamics of nuclear matrix proteome during embryonic development in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0439-0459</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Embryonic development is a complex and dynamic process that involves spatiotemporal expression of genes in a highly coordinated manner. Multiple levels of nuclear architecture maintain the fidelity of gene expression programme. One of the components of nuclear architecture, which is believed to play an important role in regulation of gene expression, is the nuclear matrix (NuMat). Many studies over the past few years have tried to analyse the components of this non-chromatin scaffolding of the nucleus and have provided evidences of its structural and functional complexity. However, the relationship of NuMat with the process of embryonic development still remains poorly understood. Here, we report a comparative analysis of the NuMat proteomes of early and late stage <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> embryos and show that 65% of the NuMat proteome is dynamic during development. Our study establishes links between the dynamics of nuclear architecture and embryonic development and provides tools to further understand the process such as cellular differentiation in the context of higher-order nuclear organization.</p>

				<title>N-terminal PDZ-like domain of chromatin organizer SATB1 contributes towards its function as transcription regulator</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0461-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The special AT-rich DNA-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding protein that acts as a global repressor via recruitment of CtBP1:HDAC1-containing co-repressors to its binding targets. The N-terminal PSD95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like domain of SATB1 mediates interactions with several chromatin proteins. In the present study, we set out to address whether the PDZ-domain-mediated interactions of SATB1 are critical for its <i>in vivo</i> function as a global repressor. We reasoned that since the N-terminal PDZ-like domain (amino acid residues 1–204) lacks DNA binding activity, it would fail to recruit the interacting partners of SATB1 to its genomic binding sites and hence would not repress the SATB1-regulated genes. Indeed, <i>in vivo</i> MAR-linked luciferase reporter assay revealed that overexpression of the PDZ-like domain resulted in de-repression, indicating that the PDZ-like domain exerts a dominant negative effect on genes regulated by SATB1. Next, we developed a stable dominant negative model in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that conditionally expressed the N-terminal 1–204 region harbouring the PDZ-like domain of SATB1. To monitor the effect of sequestration of the interaction partners on the global gene regulation by SATB1, transcripts from the induced and uninduced clones were subjected to gene expression profiling. Clustering of expression data revealed that 600 out of 19000 genes analysed were significantly upregulated upon overexpression of the PDZ-like domain. Induced genes were found to be involved in important signalling cascades and cellular functions. These studies clearly demonstrated the role of PDZ domain of SATB1 in global gene regulation presumably through its interaction with other cellular proteins.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lamins are major structural proteins of the nucleus and are essential for nuclear integrity and organization of nuclear functions. Mutations in the human lamin genes lead to highly degenerative genetic diseases that affect a number of different tissues such as muscle, adipose or neuronal tissues, or cause premature ageing syndromes. New findings on the role of lamins in cellular signalling pathways, as well as in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, have given important insights into possible mechanisms of pathogenesis.</p>

					<p>MicroRNAs (miRs), the 17- to 25-nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs, regulate expression of approximately 30% of the protein-coding genes at the post-transcriptional level and have emerged as critical components of the complex functional pathway networks controlling important cellular processes, such as proliferation, development, differentiation, stress response' and apoptosis. Abnormal expression levels of miRs, regulating critical cancerassociated pathways, have been implicated to play important roles in the oncogenic processes, functioning both as oncogenes and as tumour suppressor genes. Elucidation of the genetic networks regulated by the abnormally expressing miRs in cancer cells is proving to be extremely significant in understanding the role of these miRs in the induction of malignant-transformation-associated phenotypic changes. As a result, the miRs involved in the oncogenic transformation process are being investigated as novel biomarkers of disease detection and prognosis as well as potential therapeutic targets for human cancers. In this \article, we review the existing literature in the field documenting the significance of aberrantly expressed miRs in human pancreatic cancer and discuss how the oncogenic miRs may be involved in the genetic networks regulating functional pathways deregulated in this malignancy.</p>

				<title>FKBP immunophilins and Alzheimer's disease: A chaperoned affair</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0493-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family of immunophilins consists of proteins with a variety of protein–protein interaction domains and versatile cellular functions. Analysis of the functions of immunophilins has been the focus of studies in recent years and has led to the identification of various molecular pathways in which FKBPs play an active role. All FKBPs contain a domain with prolyl <i>cis/trans</i> isomerase (PPIase) activity. Binding of the immunosuppressant molecule FK506 to this domain inhibits their PPIase activity while mediating immune suppression through inhibition of calcineurin. The larger members, FKBP51 and FKBP52, interact with Hsp90 and exhibit chaperone activity that is shown to regulate steroid hormone signalling. From these studies it is clear that FKBP proteins are expressed ubiquitously but show relatively high levels of expression in the nervous system. Consistent with this expression, FKBPs have been implicated with both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. This review will focus on recent studies involving FKBP immunophilins in Alzheimer’s-disease-related pathways.</p>

				<title>Multimodality molecular imaging of disease progression in living subjects</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0499-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The enormous advances in our understanding of the progression of diseases at the molecular level have been supplemented by the new field of ‘molecular imaging’, which provides for <i>in vivo</i> visualization of molecular events at the cellular level in living organisms. Molecular imaging is a noninvasive assessment of gene and protein function, protein–protein interaction and/or signal transduction pathways in animal models of human disease and in patients to provide insights into molecular pathogenesis. Five major imaging techniques are currently available to assess the structural and functional alterations <i>in vivo</i> in small animals. These are</p>
					<ol>
						<li>optical bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging techniques,</li>
						<li>radionuclide-based positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emitted computed tomography (SPECT),</li>
						<li>X-ray-based computed tomography (CT),</li>
						<li>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and</li>
						<li>ultrasound imaging (US).</li>
					</ol> 
					<p>Functional molecular imaging requires an imaging probe that is specific for a given molecular event. In preclinical imaging, involving small animal models, the imaging probe could be an element of a direct (`direct imaging’) or an indirect (`indirect imaging’) event. Reporter genes are essential for indirect imaging and provide a general integrated platform for many different applications. Applications of multimodality imaging using combinations of bioluminescent, fluorescent and PET reporter genes in unified fusion vectors developed by us for recording events from single live cells to whole animals with high sensitivity and accurate quantification are discussed. Such approaches have immense potential to track progression of metastasis, immune cell trafficking, stem cell therapy, transgenic animals and even molecular interactions in living subjects.</p>

				<title>Autonomous and non-autonomous traits mediate social cooperation in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0505-0516</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the <i>trishanku</i> (<i>triA</i><sup>−</sup>) mutant of the social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, aggregates are smaller than usual and the spore mass is located mid-way up the stalk, not at the apex. We have monitored aggregate territory size, spore allocation and fruiting body morphology in chimaeric groups of (quasi-wild-type) Ax2 and <i>triA</i><sup>−</sup> cells. Developmental canalisation breaks down in chimaeras and leads to an increase in phenotypic variation. A minority of <i>triA</i><sup>−</sup> cells causes largely Ax2 aggregation streams to break up; the effect is not due to the counting factor. Most chimaeric fruiting bodies resemble those ofAx2 or <i>triA</i><sup>−</sup>. Others are double-deckers with a single stalk and two spore masses, one each at the terminus and midway along the stalk. The relative number of spores belonging to the two genotypes depends both on the mixing ratio and on the fruiting body morphology. In double-deckers formed from 1:1 chimaeras, the upper spore mass has more Ax2 spores, and the lower spore mass more <i>triA</i><sup>−</sup> spores, than expected. Thus, the traits under study depend partly on the cells’ own genotype and partly on the phenotypes, and so genotypes, of other cells: they are both autonomous and non-autonomous. These findings strengthen the parallels between multicellular development and behaviour in social groups. Besides that, they reinforce the point that a trait can be associated with a genotype only in a specified context.</p>

				<title>Evo-devo: Hydra raises its Noggin</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0517-0529</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Noggin, along with other secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitors, plays a crucial role in neural induction and neural tube patterning as well as in somitogenesis, cardiac morphogenesis and formation of the skeleton in vertebrates. The BMP signalling pathway is one of the seven fundamental pathways that drive embryonic development and pattern formation in animals. Understanding its evolutionary origin and role in pattern formation is, therefore, important to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).We have studied the evolutionary origin of BMP–Noggin antagonism in hydra, which is a powerful diploblastic model to study evolution of pattern-forming mechanisms because of the unusual cellular dynamics during its pattern formation and its remarkable ability to regenerate. We cloned and characterized the <i>noggin gene</i> from hydra and found it to exhibit considerable similarity with its orthologues at the amino acid level. Microinjection of hydra Noggin mRNA led to duplication of the dorsoventral axis in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos, demonstrating its functional conservation across the taxa. Our data, along with those of others, indicate that the evolutionarily conserved antagonism between BMP and its inhibitors predates bilateral divergence. This article reviews the various roles of Noggin in different organisms and some of our recent work on hydra Noggin in the context of evolution of developmental signalling pathways.</p>

				<title>Non-apoptotic function of apoptotic proteins in the development of Malpighian tubules of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0531-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Drosophila</i> metamorphosis is characterized by the histolysis of larval structures by programmed cell death, which paves the way for the establishment of adult-specific structures under the influence of the steroid hormone ecdysone. Malpighian tubules function as an excretory system and are one of the larval structures that are not destroyed during metamorphosis and are carried over to adulthood. The pupal Malpighian tubules evade destruction in spite of expressing apoptotic proteins, Reaper, Hid, Grim, Dronc and Drice. Here we show that in the Malpighian tubules expression of apoptotic proteins commences right from embryonic development and continues throughout the larval stages. Overexpression of these proteins in the Malpighian tubules causes larval lethality resulting in malformed tubules. The number and regular organization of principal and stellate cells of Malpighian tubules is disturbed, in turn disrupting the physiological functioning of the tubules as well. Strikingly, the localization of 𝛽-tubulin, F-actin and Disclarge (Dlg) is also disrupted. These results suggest that the apoptotic proteins could be having non-apoptotic function in the development of Malpighian tubules.</p>

				<title>Is hexamerin receptor a GPI-anchored protein in <i>Achaea janata</i> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0545-0553</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The process of uptake of hexamerins during metamorphosis from insect haemolymph by fat body cells is reminiscent of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Previously, we had identified a hexamerin-binding protein (HBP) and reported for the first time that uptake of hexamerins is dependent on the phosphorylation of HBP partly by a tyrosine kinase, which is, in turn, activated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). However, the exact nature of HBP and the mechanism of interaction are still unknown. Here we report the possibility of HBP being a GPI-anchored protein in the fat body of <i>Achaea janata</i> and its role in the tyrosine-kinase-mediated phosphorylation signalling. Digestion of fat body membrane preparation with bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), and the subsequent recognition by antibodies specific for the cross-reacting determinant (CRD), revealed that HBP is glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein and, further, that the hexamerin binding to HBP was inhibited after digestion. Hexamerin overlay assay (HOA) of co-immunoprecipitated <i>in vitro</i> phosphorylated HBP showed exclusive binding to &#8764;120 kDa protein. Lectin-binding analysis of hexamerins revealed the presence of 𝑁-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and 𝑁-acetylglucosamine (GluNAc), whereas HBP showed the presence of GalNac alone. Mild chemical deglycosylation studies and binding interaction in the presence of sugars revealed that glycan moieties are possibly not involved in the interaction between HBP and hexamerins. Taken together, these results suggest that HBP may be a GPI-anchored protein, and interaction and activation of HBP is through lipid-linked non-receptor <i>src</i> tyrosine kinases. However, additional studies are needed to prove that HBP is a GPI-anchored protein.</p>

				<title>Adaptation or exaptation? The case of the human hand</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0575-0585</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A controversy of relevance to the study of biological form involves the concept of adaptation. This controversy is illustrated by the structure and function of the human hand. A review of the principal definitions of adaptation points to two main problems: (1) they are qualitative and make reference to the whole structure (or substructural feature) and (2) they are based on the idea of natural selection as a moulding factor. The first problem would be solved by a definition that encompasses quantitative measures of the effects of selection, drawing on new advances in the comparative method. The second problem is deeper and presents greater conceptual difficulties. I will argue that the idea of natural selection as a moulding factor depends on the notion of a genetic program for development. But regarding the hand, experimental evidence on limb development challenges the idea of a genetic program for skeletal pattern formation, undermining a simple application of standard adaptationist concepts. These considerations lead to a revised definition of adaptation and interpretation of the evolutionary determinants of the hand’s form.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0587-0601</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Of all known transposable elements, phage Mu exhibits the highest transposition efficiency and the lowest target specificity. <i>In vitro</i>, MuB protein is responsible for target choice. In this work, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the genome-wide distribution of MuB and its relationship to Mu target selection using high-resolution <i>Escherichia coli</i> tiling DNA arrays. We have also assessed how MuB binding and Mu transposition are influenced by chromosome-organizing elements such as AT-rich DNA signatures, or the binding of the nucleoid-associated protein Fis, or processes such as transcription. The results confirm and extend previous biochemical and lower resolution <i>in vivo</i> data. Despite the generally random nature of Mu transposition and MuB binding, there were hot and cold insertion sites and MuB binding sites in the genome, and differences between the hottest and coldest sites were large. The new data also suggest that MuB distribution and subsequent Mu integration is responsive to DNA sequences that contribute to the structural organization of the chromosome.</p>

				<title><i>RET</i> gene mutations and polymorphisms in medullary thyroid carcinomas in Indian patients</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0603-0611</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Germline mutations of <i>RET</i> gene are pathognomonic of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN; MEN 2A/MEN 2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), constituting 25% of medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs). We investigated <i>RET</i> gene mutations and polymorphisms at exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 in 140 samples, comprising 51 clinically diagnosed MTC patients, 39 family members of patients and 50 normal individuals. The method of choice was PCR and direct nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products. <i>RET</i> gene mutations were detected in 15 (29.4%) patients, with MEN 2A/FMTC in 13 patients and MEN 2B in 2 patients. Further, 39 family members of seven index cases were analysed, wherein four of the seven index cases showed identical mutations, in 13 of 25 family members. We also examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>RET</i> gene exons in 101 unrelated samples. Significant differences in the allelic frequencies of SNPs at codons 691, 769, 836 and 904 between patient and control groups were not observed. However, SNP frequencies were significantly different in the Indian group as compared with other European groups. We identified two novel, rare and unique SNPs separately in single patients. Our study demonstrated presence of MEN 2A/MEN 2B/FMTC-associated mutations in accordance with the reported literature. Thus, <i>RET</i> gene mutations in exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 constitute a rapid test to confirm diagnosis and assess risk of the disease in familial MEN 2A/MEN 2B/FMTC.</p>

				<title>Transgene transmission in chickens by sperm-mediated gene transfer after seminal plasma removal and exogenous DNA treated with dimethylsulfoxide or 𝑁,𝑁-dimethylacetamide</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transgenic animals have been successfully produced by mass gene transfer techniques such as sperm-mediated gene transfer (SMGT). The aim of this work was to demonstrate transgene transmission by SMGT in chickens using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or 𝑁,𝑁-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as transfectants after seminal plasma removal to prevent DNase activity. Sperm samples were prepared by repetitive washes, and after each wash sperm motility, seminal plasma proteins, exogenous DNA integrity and its uptake by spermatozoa were evaluated. Laying hens were inseminated using spermatozoa transfected with pEGFP-N1 vector in the presence of DMSO or DMAc. Transgene transmission in newborn chicks was evaluated by <i>in vivo</i> enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression, RT-PCR and PCR analysis. DNA internalization was limited to sperm samples washed twice. The presence of DMSO or DMAc during transfection had no effect on fertilization or hatching rates. PCR analysis detected the presence of EGFP DNA in 38% of newborn chicks from the DMSO group and 19% from the DMAc group. EGFP mRNA was detected in 21% of newborn chicks from the DMSO group, as against 8.5% from the DMAc group. However, <i>in vivo</i> expression of EGFP was only observed in a single animal from the DMSO group. Our data revealed that the plasmid DNA–DMSO combination coupled with sperm washes can be an efficient method for transfection in chickens.</p>

				<title>The regulatory epicenter of miRNAs</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0621-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with average length of &#8764;21 bp. miRNA formation seems to be dependent upon multiple factors besides Drosha and Dicer, in a tissue/stage-specific manner, with interplay of several specific binding factors. In the present study, we have investigated transcription factor binding sites in and around the genomic sequences of precursor miRNAs and RNA-binding protein (RBP) sites in miRNA precursor sequences, analysed and tested in comprehensive manner. Here, we report that miRNA precursor regions are positionally enriched for binding of transcription factors as well as RBPs around the 3&#8242; end of mature miRNA region in 5&#8242; arm. The pattern and distribution of such regulatory sites appears to be a characteristic of precursor miRNA sequences when compared with non-miRNA sequences as negative dataset and tested statistically. When compared with 1 kb upstreamregions, a sudden sharp peak for binding sites arises in the enriched zone near the mature miRNA region. An expression-data-based correlation analysis was performed between such miRNAs and their corresponding transcription factors and RBPs for this region. Some specific groups of binding factors and associated miRNAs were identified. We also identified some of the overrepresented transcription factors and associated miRNAs with high expression correlation values which could be useful in cancer-related studies. The highly correlated groups were found to host experimentally validated composite regulatory modules, in which Lmo2-GATA1 appeared as the predominant one. For many of RBP–miRNAs associations, co-expression similarity was also evident among the associated miRNA common to given RBPs, supporting the Regulon model, suggesting a common role and common control of these miRNAs by the associated RBPs. Based on our findings, we propose that the observed characteristic distribution of regulatory sites in precursor miRNA sequence regions could be critical inmiRNA transcription, processing, stability and formation and are important for therapeutic studies. Our findings also support the recently proposed theory of self-sufficient mode of transcription by miRNAs, which states that miRNA transcription can be carried out in host-independent mode too.</p>

				<title>Synergistic growth inhibition of cancer cells harboring the <i>RET/PTC1</i> oncogene by staurosporine and rotenone involves enhanced cell death</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0639-0648</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>TPC-1 is a highly proliferative thyroid papillary carcinoma-derived cell line. These cells express the RET/PTC1 fusion protein, whose isoforms are characterized in this work. The bacterial alkaloid staurosporine and the plant extract rotenone are death-inducing drugs that have an inhibitory synergistic effect on the growth of TPC-1 cells. We show that this synergism is accompanied by an enhancement of the induction of cell death. Staurosporine alone induces cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1</sub>, whereas rotenone induces arrest in G<sub>2</sub>/M. We suggest that this additive pressure may drive cells to die, resulting in the synergistic interaction of the drug combination. These data emphasize the potential use of the staurosporine plus rotenone combination as an anticancer tool.</p>

				<title><i>Argonaute</i>-2-null embryonic stem cells are retarded in self-renewal and differentiation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0649-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>RNA interference (RNAi) pathways regulate self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. <i>Argonaute 2</i> (<i>Ago2</i>) is a vital component of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and the only Ago protein with slicer activity. We generated <i>Ago2</i>-deficient ES cells by conditional gene targeting. <i>Ago2</i>-deficient ES cells are defective in the small-RNA-mediated gene silencing and are significantly compromised in biogenesis of mature microRNA. The self-renewal rate of <i>Ago2</i>-deficient ES cells is affected due to failure of silencing of <i>Cdkn1a</i> by ES-cell-specific microRNAs (miRNA) in the absence of <i>Ago2</i>. Interestingly, unlike <i>Dicer</i>- and <i>Dgcr8</i>-deficient ES cells, they differentiate to all three germ layers both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. However, early differentiation of <i>Ago2</i>-deficient ES cells is delayed by 2–4 days as indicated by persistence of higher levels of self-renewal/ pluripotency markers during differentiation. Further, appearance of morphological and differentiation markers is also delayed during the differentiation. In this study we show that <i>Ago2</i> is essential for normal self-renewal and differentiation. Also, our data suggest that self-renewal and differentiation of ES cells are regulated by both siRNA and miRNA pathways.</p>

				<title>Proteomic identification of CIB1 as a potential diagnostic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0659-0668</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), among the most common malignancies worldwide, remains a major threat to public health, and there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and targets for anti-cancer treatment. In this study, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis was used to identify differentially expressed proteins among the HCC tumour centre, tumour margin and nontumourous liver tissues. In total, 52 spots with significant alteration were positively identified by MS/MSanalysis. Altered expression of representative proteins, including CIB1, was validated by Western blotting. Immunostaining suggested an increase tendency of CIB1 expression from nontumourous liver tissue to tumour centre. Knockdown of CIB1 expression by RNA interference led to the significant suppression of the cell growth in hepatoma HepG2 cells. These data suggest that CIB1 may be used as a novel prognostic factor and possibly an attractive therapeutic target for HCC.</p>

				<title>Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy as a diagnostic tool for distinguishing between normal and malignant human gastric tissue</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0669-0677</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy can be considered to be a fast and non-invasive tool for distinguishing between normal and cancerous cells and tissues without the need for laborious and invasive sampling procedures. Gastric samples from four patients (age, 65&#177;2 years) were analysed. Samples were obtained from the organs removed during gastrectomy and then classified as normal or cancerous. Classification was based on histopathological examinations at our institution. Formalin-fixed sections of gastric tissue were analysed by FTIR-microspectroscopy. To characterize differences between sections of normal and cancerous tissue, specific regions of the spectra were analysed to study variations in the levels of metabolites. To distinguish between two conditions (normal and cancerous), changes in the relative intensity of bands in the range 600–4000 cm<sup>−1</sup> were analysed. A FTIR spectral map of the bands in the region 2800–3100 cm<sup>–1</sup> and 900–1800 cm<sup>–1</sup> were created to analyse pathological changes in tissues. The limited data available showed that normal gastric tissue had stronger absorption than cancerous tissue over a wide region in the four patients. There was a significant decrease in total biomolecular components for cancerous tissue compared with normal tissue.</p>

				<title>Aggregation properties of a short peptide that mediates amyloid fibril formation in model proteins unrelated to disease</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0679-0689</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Short peptides have been identified from amyloidogenic proteins that form amyloid fibrils in isolation. The hexapeptide stretch <sup>21</sup>DIDLHL<sup>26</sup> has been shown to be important in the self-assembly of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of p85𝛼 subunit of bovine phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-SH3). The SH3 domain of chicken brain 𝛼-spectrin, which is otherwise non-amyloidogenic, is rendered amyloidogenic if <sup>22</sup>EVTMKK<sup>27</sup> is replaced by DIDLHL. In this article, we describe the aggregation behaviour of DIDLHL-COOH and DIDLHL-CONH<sub>2</sub>. Our results indicate that DIDLHL-COOH and DIDLHL-CONH<sub>2</sub> aggregate to form spherical structures at pH 5 and 6. At pH 5, in the presence of mica, DIDLHL-CONH<sub>2</sub> forms short fibrous structures. The presence of NaCl along with mica results in fibrillar structures. At pH 6, DIDLHL-CONH<sub>2</sub> forms largely spherical aggregates. Both the peptides are unstructured in solution but adopt 𝛽-conformation on drying. The aggregates formed by DIDLHL-COOH and DIDLHL-CONH<sub>2</sub> are formed during drying process and their structures are modulated by the presence of mica and salt. Our study suggests that a peptide need not have intrinsic amyloidogenic propensity to facilitate the selfassembly of the full-length protein. The propensity of peptides to form self-assembled structures that are non-amyloidogenic could be important in potentiating the self-assembly of full-length proteins into amyloid fibrils.</p>

				<title>Differences in predatory pressure on terrestrial snails by birds and mammals</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0691-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The evolution of shell polymorphism in terrestrial snails is a classic textbook example of the effect of natural selection in which avian and mammalian predation represents an important selective force on gene frequency. However, many questions about predation remain unclear, especially in the case of mammals. We collected 2000 specimens from eight terrestrial gastropod species to investigate the predation pressure exerted by birds and mice on snails. We found evidence of avian and mammalian predation in 26.5% and 36.8% of the shells. Both birds and mammals were selective with respect to snail species, size and morphs. Birds preferred the brown-lipped banded snail <i>Cepaea nemoralis</i> (L.) and mice preferred the burgundy snail <i>Helix</i> pomatia L. Mice avoided pink mid-banded <i>C. nemoralis</i> and preferred brown mid-banded morphs, which were neglected by birds. In contrast to mice, birds chose larger individuals. Significant differences in their predatory pressure can influence the evolution and maintenance of shell size and polymorphism of shell colouration in snails.</p>

				<page>0701-0708</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study was undertaken in seven major forest types of temperate zone (1500 m a.s.l. to 3100 m a.s.l.) of Garhwal Himalaya to understand the effect of slope aspects on carbon (C) density and make recommendations for forest management based on priorities for C conservation/sequestration. We assessed soil organic carbon (SOC) density, tree density, biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) on four aspects, viz. north-east (NE), north-west (NW), south-east (SE) and south-west (SW), in forest stands dominated by <i>Abies pindrow, Cedrus deodara, Pinus roxburghii, Cupressus torulosa, Quercus floribunda, Quercus semecarpifolia</i> and <i>Quercus leucotrichophora</i>. TCD ranged between 77.3 CMg ha<sup>−1</sup> on SE aspect (<i>Quercus leucotrichophora</i> forest) and 291.6 CMg ha<sup>−1</sup> on NE aspect (moist <i>Cedrus deodara</i> forest). SOC varied between 40.3 CMg ha<sup>−1</sup> on SW aspect (Himalayan <i>Pinus roxburghii</i> forest) and 177.5 CMg ha<sup>−1</sup> on NE aspect (moist <i>Cedrus deodara</i> forest). Total C density (SOC+TCD) ranged between 118.1 CMg ha<sup>−1</sup> on SW aspect (Himalayan <i>Pinus roxburghii</i> forest) and 469.1 CMg ha<sup>−1</sup> on NE aspect (moist <i>Cedrus deodara</i> forest). SOC and TCD were significantly higher on northern aspects as compared with southern aspects. It is recommended that for C sequestration, the plantation silviculture be exercised on northern aspects, and for C conservation purposes, mature forest stands growing on northern aspects be given priority.</p>

				<title>Eu-Detect: An algorithm for detecting eukaryotic sequences in metagenomic data sets</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0709-0717</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Physical partitioning techniques are routinely employed (during sample preparation stage) for segregating the prokaryotic and eukaryotic fractions of metagenomic samples. In spite of these efforts, several metagenomic studies focusing on bacterial and archaeal populations have reported the presence of contaminating eukaryotic sequences inmetagenomic data sets. Contaminating sequences originate not only from genomes of micro-eukaryotic species but also from genomes of (higher) eukaryotic host cells. The latter scenario usually occurs in the case of host-associatedmetagenomes. Identification and removal of contaminating sequences is important, since these sequences not only impact estimates of microbial diversity but also affect the accuracy of several downstream analyses. Currently, the computational techniques used for identifying contaminating eukaryotic sequences, being alignment based, are slow, inefficient, and require huge computing resources. In this article, we present Eu-Detect, an alignment-free algorithm that can rapidly identify eukaryotic sequences contaminating metagenomic data sets. Validation results indicate that on a desktop with modest hardware specifications, the Eu-Detect algorithm is able to rapidly segregate DNA sequence fragments of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin, with high sensitivity. A Web server for the Eu-Detect algorithm is available at <i>http://metagenomics.atc.tcs.com/Eu-Detect/</i>.</p>

				<title>Genome-based versus gene-based theory of cancer: Possible implications for clinical practice</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0719-0724</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The current state in oncology research indicates that the attempts to explain such complex process as cancerogenesis by a single or several genetic mutations were not successful enough. On the other hand, chromosomal/genomic instability – almost universal features of malignant tumours which influence a global pattern of gene expression and, subsequently, many oncogenic pathways – were often disregarded and considered nonessential to clinical application. However, a new arising field of system biology including ‘new forms’ of genome diversity such as copy number variations (CNV) and high-throughput oncogene mutation profiling now reveal all the complexity of cancer and provide the final explanation of the oncogenic pathways, based on stochastic (onco)genomic variation rather than on (onco)genic concepts.</p>

				<title>Nucleic acid therapy for lifespan prolongation: Present and future</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0725-0729</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lifespan prolongation is a common desire of the human race. With advances in biotechnology, the mechanism of aging has been gradually unraveled, laying the theoretical basis of nucleic acid therapy for lifespan prolongation. Regretfully, clinically applicable interventions do not exist without the efforts of converting theory into action, and it is the latter that has been far from adequately addressed at the moment. This was demonstrated by a database search on PubMed and Web of Science, from which only seven studies published between 2000 and 2010 were found to directly touch on the development of nucleic acid therapy for anti-aging and/or longevity enhancing purposes. In light of this, the objective of this article is to overview the current understanding of the intimate association between genes and longevity, and to bring the prospect of nucleic acid therapy for lifespan prolongation to light.</p>

					<p>Hypertension is one of the leading causes of disability or death due to stroke, heart attack and kidney failure. Because the etiology of essential hypertension is not known and may be multifactorial, the use of experimental animal models has provided valuable information regarding many aspects of the disease, which include etiology, pathophysiology, complications and treatment. The models of hypertension are various, and in this review, we provide a brief overview of the most widely used animal models, their features and their importance.</p>

				<title>Mango ginger (<i>Curcuma amada</i> Roxb.) – A promising spice for phytochemicals and biological activities</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0739-0748</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mango ginger (<i>Curcuma amada</i> Roxb.) is a unique spice having morphological resemblance with ginger but imparts a raw mango flavour. The main use of mango ginger rhizome is in the manufacture of pickles and culinary preparations. Ayurveda and Unani medicinal systems have given much importance to mango ginger as an appetizer, alexteric, antipyretic, aphrodisiac, diuretic, emollient, expectorant and laxative and to cure biliousness, itching, skin diseases, bronchitis, asthma, hiccough and inflammation due to injuries. The biological activities of mango ginger include antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity, antifungal activity, anti-inflammatory activity, platelet aggregation inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, antiallergic activity, hypotriglyceridemic activity, brine-shrimp lethal activity, enterokinase inhibitory activity, CNS depressant and analgesic activity. The major chemical components include starch, phenolic acids, volatile oils, curcuminoids and terpenoids like difurocumenonol, amadannulen and amadaldehyde. This article brings to light the major active components present in <i>C. amada</i> along with their biological activities that may be important from the pharmacological point of view.</p>

				<title>Fibrinolysis and anticoagulant potential of a metallo protease produced by <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> K42</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0773-0779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a potent fibrinolytic enzyme-producing bacterium was isolated from soybean flour and identified as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> K42 and assayed <i>in vitro</i> for its thrombolytic potential. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was 20.5 kDa and purification increased its specific activity 390-fold with a recovery of 14%. Maximal activity was attained at a temperature of 40&#176;C (stable up to 65&#176;C) and pH of 9.4 (range: 6.5–10.5). The enzyme retained up to 80% of its original activity after pre-incubation for a month at 4&#176;C with organic solvents such as diethyl ether (DE), toluene (TO), acetonitrile (AN), butanol (BU), ethyl acetate (EA), ethanol (ET), acetone (AC), methanol (ME), isopropanol (IP), diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), tosyl-lysyl-chloromethylketose (TLCK), tosyl-phenylalanyl chloromethylketose (TPCK), phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI). Aprotinin had little effect on this activity. The presence of ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a metal-chelating agent and two metallo protease inhibitors, 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine and 𝑜-phenanthroline, repressed the enzymatic activity significantly. This, however, could be restored by adding Co<sup>2+</sup> to the medium. The clotting time of human blood serum in the presence of this enzyme reached a relative PTT of 241.7% with a 3.4-fold increase, suggesting that this enzyme could be an effective antithrombotic agent.</p>

				<title>The membranotropic activity of N-terminal peptides from the pore-forming proteins sticholysin I and II is modulated by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions as well as lipid composition</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0781-0791</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sea anemone <i>Stichodactyla helianthus</i> produces two pore-forming proteins, sticholysins I and II (St I and St II). Despite their high identity (93%), these toxins exhibit differences in hemolytic activity that can be related to those found in their N-terminal. To clarify the contribution of the N-terminal amino acid residues to the activity of the toxins, we synthesized peptides spanning residues 1–31 of St I (StI<sub>1-31</sub>) or 1–30 of St II (StII<sub>1-30</sub>) and demonstrated that StII<sub>1-30</sub> promotes erythrocyte lysis to a higher extent than StI<sub>1-31</sub>. For a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the peptide activity, here we studied their binding to lipid monolayers and pemeabilizing activity in liposomes. For this, we examined the effect on peptide membranotropic activity of including phospatidic acid and cholesterol in a lipid mixture of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. The results suggest the importance of continuity of the 1–10 hydrophobic sequence in StII<sub>1-30</sub> for displaying higher binding and activity, in spite of both peptides’ abilities to form pores in giant unilamellar vesicles. Thus, the different peptide membranotropic action is explained in terms of the differences in hydrophobic and electrostatic peptide properties as well as the enhancing role of membrane inhomogeneities.</p>

				<title>Quaternary association in 𝛽-prism I fold plant lectins: Insights from X-ray crystallography, modelling and molecular dynamics</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0793-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dimeric banana lectin and calsepa, tetrameric artocarpin and octameric heltuba are mannose-specific 𝛽-prism I fold lectins of nearly the same tertiary structure. MD simulations on individual subunits and the oligomers provide insights into the changes in the structure brought about in the protomers on oligomerization, including swapping of the N-terminal stretch in one instance. The regions that undergo changes also tend to exhibit dynamic flexibility during MD simulations. The internal symmetries of individual oligomers are substantially retained during the calculations. Energy minimization and simulations were also carried out on models using all possible oligomers by employing the four different protomers. The unique dimerization pattern observed in calsepa could be traced to unique substitutions in a peptide stretch involved in dimerization. The impossibility of a specific mode of oligomerization involving a particular protomer is often expressed in terms of unacceptable steric contacts or dissociation of the oligomer during simulations. The calculations also led to a rationale for the observation of a heltuba tetramer in solution although the lectin exists as an octamer in the crystal, in addition to providing insights into relations among evolution, oligomerization and ligand binding.</p>

				<title>Faster heme loss from hemoglobin E than HbS, in acidic pH: Effect of aminophospholipids</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0809-0816</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report studies on loss of heme at or below pH 3.0 from two clinically important hemoglobin variants, HbE and HbS, in the presence and absence of phopholipid membranes. The kinetics of heme loss has been studied at pH 3.0 to simulate the same at a faster rate than at physiological pH, for spectroscopic investigation. Results obtained from the study clearly establish the probable fate of the lost heme to partition into the phospholipid bilayer independent of the pH range. This is also of particular importance to membranes containing the aminophospholipid and cholesterol which are predominantly localized in the inner leaflet of erythrocytes. Absorption measurements indicated such loss of heme when the Soret peak at 415 nm blue-shifted to 380 nm at pH 3.0. The extent of this blue shift decreased from 35 nm to &#8764;15 nm in the presence of small unilammelar vesicles of both dimyristoyl- and dioleoyl-based phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating partitioning of the released heme in the membrane bilayer. The kinetics of heme loss was faster from HbE than HbA and HbS, obeying first-order reaction kinetics. Released heme could be involved in the premature destruction of erythrocytes in hemoglobin disorders.</p>

				<title>A factor in a wild isolated <i>Neurospora crassa</i> strain enables a chromosome segment duplication to suppress repeat-induced point mutation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0817-0821</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) is a sexual stage-specific mutational process of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> and other fungi that alters duplicated DNA sequences. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that chromosome segment duplications (<i>Dps</i>) longer than &#8764;300 kbp can dominantly suppress RIP, presumably by titration of the RIP machinery, and that although <i>Dps</i> &#60; 200 kbp did not individually suppress RIP, they could do so in homozygous and multiply heterozygous crosses, provided the sum of the duplicated DNA exceeds &#8764;300 kbp. Here we demonstrate suppression of RIP in a subset of progeny carrying the normally sub-threshold 154 kbp <i>Dp(R2394)</i> from a cross of <i>T(R2394)</i> to the wild isolated Carrefour Mme. Gras strain (CMG). Thus, the CMG strain contains a factor that together with <i>Dp(R2394)</i> produces a synthetic RIP suppressor phenotype. It is possible that the factor is a cryptic <i>Dp</i> that together with <i>Dp(R2394)</i> can exceed the size threshold for titration of the RIP machinery and thereby causes RIP suppression.</p>

				<title><i>TP53</i> gene polymorphism: Importance to cancer, ethnicity and birth weight in a Brazilian cohort</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0823-0831</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Arg72Pro SNP of p53 has been associated with many types of cancer as well as with survival and longevity. We evaluated the Arg72Pro SNP frequencies of a Brazilian birth cohort and their association with current, demographic and birth epidemiological parameters available. In 1982, all hospital births of Pelotas, southern Brazil, were identified and studied prospectively. In 2004–5, blood samples were collected and DNA extracted. PCR-RFLP was used to genotype the Arg72Pro SNP in 3794 individual samples of the Brazil birth cohort and DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the genotypes. The genotype distribution, which was in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, showed a predominance of the arginine amino acid with a frequency of 46.9% Arg/Arg, 42.2% Arg/Pro and 10.9% Pro/Pro. The allele frequency was 0.68 of Arginine and 0.32 of Proline. The Arg72Pro SNP genotype and allelic frequency were related to skin colour where proline amino acid was observed more among black subjects, while arginine amino acid was observed more among white subjects. The individuals without family history of cancer and those with low birth weight were associated with arginine amino acid. The Arg72Pro SNP was strongly associated with important epidemiological variables confirming that genetic profiles on cohort studies can improve our understanding of the susceptibility of diseases and its risk factors.</p>

				<title>Identification and characterization of a novel legume-like lectin cDNA sequence from the red marine algae <i>Gracilaria fisheri</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0833-0843</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A legume-type lectin (L-lectin) gene of the red algae <i>Gracilaria fisheri</i> (GFL) was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of GFL was 1714 bp and contained a 1542 bp open reading frame encoding 513 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 56.5 kDa. Analysis of the putative amino acid sequence with NCBI-BLAST revealed a high homology (30–68%) with legume-type lectins (L-lectin) from <i>Griffithsia japonica, Clavispora lusitaniae, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> and <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i>. Phylogenetic relationship analysis showed the highest sequence identity to a glycoprotein of the red algae <i>Griffithsia japonica</i> (68%) (GenBank number AAM93989). Conserved Domain Database analysis detected an N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), the characteristic of L-lectins, which contained two sugar binding sites and a metal binding site. The secondary structure prediction of GFL showed a 𝛽-sheet structure, connected with turn and coil. The most abundant structural element of GFL was the random coil, while the 𝛼-helixes were distributed at the N- and C-termini, and 21 𝛽-sheets were distributed in the CRD. Computer analysis of three-dimensional structure showed a common feature of L-lectins of GFL, which included an overall globular shape that was composed of a 𝛽-sandwich of two anti-parallel 𝛽-sheets, monosaccharide binding sites, were on the top of the structure and in proximity with a metal binding site. Northern blot analysis using a DIG-labelled probe derived from a partial GFL sequence revealed a hybridization signal of &#8764;1.7 kb consistent with the length of the full-length GFL cDNA identified by RACE. No detectable band was observed from control total RNA extracted from filamentous green algae.</p>

				<page>0845-0850</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The maternally inherited obligate bacteria <i>Wolbachia</i> is known to infect various lepidopteran insects. However, so far only a few butterfly species harbouring this bacterium have been thoroughly studied. The current study aims to identify the infection status of these bacteria in some of the commonly found butterfly species in India. A total of nine butterfly species belonging to four different families were screened using PCR with <i>Wolbachia</i>-specific <i>wsp</i> and <i>ftsZ</i> primers. The presence of the <i>Wolbachia</i> super group ‘B’ in the butterflies Red Pierrot, <i>Talicada nyseus</i> (Guerin) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) and Blue Mormon, <i>Papilio polymnestor</i> Cramer (Papilionidae), is documented for the first time in India. The study also gives an account on the lifetime fecundity and female-biased sex ratio in <i>T. nyseus</i>, suggesting a putative role for <i>Wolbachia</i> in the observed female-biased sex ratio distortion.</p>

				<title>Ventilation rates indicate stress-coping styles in Nile tilapia</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0851-0855</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Behavioural responses to stress can form distinct profiles in a wide range of animals: proactive and reactive profiles or coping styles. Stress responsiveness can also differentiate between the behavioural profiles. The tendency to regain feed intake following transfer to a novel social-isolation tank (the speed of acclimation) can discriminate between proactive or reactive profiles. Consequently, differential stress responsiveness can be linked to this feeding behaviour trait. This study shows that ventilation rates of Nile tilapia, <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> (L.), correlate with the rate of feeding resumption, following transfer to a novel social-isolation aquarium. Therefore, ventilation rate (VR) indicates coping styles; consequently, VR is a proxy for the way fish will deal with environmental challenges.</p>

				<title>A two-step genetic study on quantitative precursors of coronary artery disease in a homogeneous Indian population: Case–control association discovery and validation by transmission-disequilibrium test</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0857-0868</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In spite of its strong familiality, gene identification for coronary artery disease (CAD) has not yielded a consistent picture. One major reason for this is that families or cases and controls were not recruited from a homogeneous population. We, therefore, attempted to map genes underlying 10 quantitative traits (QTs) that are known precursors of CAD in a homogeneous population (Marwari) of India. The QTs are apolipoprotein B (ApoB), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen (FBG), homocysteine (HCY), lipoprotein (a) (LPA), cholesterol – total (CHOL-T), cholesterol – HDL (CHOL-H), cholesterol – LDL (CHOL-L), cholesterol – VLDL (CHOL-V) and triglyceride (TG). We assayed 209 SNPs in 31 genes among members of Marwari families. After log-transformation and covariate-adjustment of the QTs, a two-step analysis was performed. In Step-1, data on unrelated individuals were analysed for association with the SNPs. In Step-2, for validation of Step-1 results, a quantitative transmission-disequilibrium test on parent–offspring data was performed for each SNP found to be significantly associated with a QT in Step-1 on an independent sample set drawn from the same population. Statistically significant results found for the various QTs and SNPs were: rs3774933, rs230528, rs230521, rs1005819 and rs1609798 (intronic, NFKB1) with APOB; rs5361 (Missense, R &#62; S, <i>SELE</i>) and rs4648004 (Intronic, <i>NFKB1</i>) with FBG; rs4220 (Missense, K &#62; R, <i>FGB</i>) with HCY; and rs3025035 (Intronic, <i>VEGFA</i>) with CHOL-H. SNPs in <i>SELE, VEGFA, FGB</i> and <i>NFKB1</i> genes impact significantly on levels of quantitative precursors of CAD in Marwaris.</p>

				<title>Polyopes affinis alleviates airway inflammation in a murine model of allergic asthma</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0869-0877</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Marine algae have been utilized in food as well as medicine products for a variety of purposes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an ethanol extract of <i>Polyopes affinis</i> (<i>P.affinis</i>) can inhibit the pathogenesis of T helper 2 (Th2)-mediated allergen-induced airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma. Mice that were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) evidenced typical asthmatic reactions such as the following: an increase in the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid; a marked influx of inflammatory cells into the lung around blood vessels and airways as well as the narrowing of the airway luminal; the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR); the presence of pulmonary Th2 cytokines; and the presence of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the serum. The successive intraperitoneal administration of <i>P. affinis</i> ethanolic extracts before the last airway OVA-challenge resulted in a significant inhibition of all asthmatic reactions. These data suggest that <i>P. affinis</i> ethanolic extracts possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of pulmonary allergic disorders such as allergic asthma.</p>

				<title>Inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 by podophyllotoxin: Implication for clinical drug–drug interactions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0879-0885</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Podophyllotoxin (PPT) and its derivatives exert significant anti-cancer activities, and one derivative etoposide is often utilized to treat various cancers in the clinic. The aim of the present study is to investigate the inhibitory effects of PPT on major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms in human livers. Inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP2A6 by PPT was investigated in the human liver microsomal system. Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by PPT was also evaluated. The results showed that PPT strongly exhibited inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Half inhibition concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was 1.1&#177;0.3 and 4.6&#177;0.3 𝜇M for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, respectively. Inhibition kinetic analysis showed that PPT exhibited competitive inhibition towards CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 with K<sub>i</sub> of 1.6 and 2.0 𝜇M, respectively. Additionally, PPT exerted time-dependent inhibition towards CYP3A4 and the kinetic parameters were 4.4&#177;2.1 𝜇M and 0.06&#177;0.01 min<sup>–1</sup> for K<sub>I</sub> and k<sub>inact</sub>, respectively. Our experimental data indicate that potential drug–drug interaction (DDI) might exist when PPT is co-administered with the substrates which mainly undergo CYP3A4- or CYP2C9-mediated metabolism.</p>

				<title>Geometry and evolutionary parallelism in the long bones of cavioid rodents and small artiodactyls</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0887-0895</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Morphological parallelism between South American cavioid rodents and small artiodactyls from the Old World has been postulated for a long time. Our study deals with this question from the point of view of biomechanical characteristics of the long bones. For this, cross-sectional area, second moment of the area, polar moment, athletic ability indicators and strength were calculated for the long bones (i.e. humerus, radius, femur and tibia) of five species of cavioids and two species of artiodactyls. Regressions of all these variables to body mass were established. Regarding the cross-sectional area, the confidence intervals show that the exponents calculated are not significantly different from the geometrical predicted value. The exponents obtained for the second moment of area and the polar moment are not significantly different from the geometrical prediction, except for the humerus. The two indicators of athletic ability scaled as expected, but the bending indicator of athletic ability of the femur was not correlated to body mass. The exponent calculated for femur strength is not different from zero, while the strength of the humerus decreases slightly with the body mass. Additional statistical tests (ANCOVAs) showed no difference between the values of these variables calculated for the samples studied of artiodactyls and rodents. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is significant evolutionary parallelism between cavioid rodents and small artiodactyls.</p>

				<title>Structure, composition and mechanical properties of the silk fibres of the egg case of the Joro spider, <i>Nephila clavata</i> (Araneae, Nephilidae)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0897-0910</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The silk egg case and orb web of spiders are elaborate structures that are assembled from a number of components. We analysed the structure, the amino acid and fibre compositions, and the tensile properties of the silk fibres of the egg case of <i>Nephila clavata</i>. SEM shows that the outer and inner covers of the egg case consist of thick, medium and thin silk fibres. The silk fibres of the outer cover of the egg case are probably produced by the major and minor ampullate glands. The silk fibres of the inner cover of the egg case from cylindrical glands appears to be distinct from the silk fibres of the major ampullate glands based on their micro-morphology, mole percent amino acid composition and types, and tensile behaviour and properties. Collectively, our investigations show that <i>N. clavata</i> uses silk fibres from relatively few glands in varying combinations to achieve different physical and chemical properties (e.g., color, diameter, morphology and amino acid composition) and functional and mechanical properties in the different layers of the egg case.</p>

				<title>Gravitational biology and space life sciences: Current status and implications for the Indian space programme</title>
				<feature>Mini-review</feature>
				<page>0911-0919</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper is an introduction to gravitational and space life sciences and a summary of key achievements in the field. Current global research is focused on understanding the effects of gravity/microgravity onmicrobes, cells, plants, animals and humans. It is now established that many plants and animals can progress through several generations in microgravity. Astrobiology is emerging as an exciting field promoting research in biospherics and fabrication of controlled environmental life support systems. India is one of the 14-nation International Space Exploration Coordination Group (2007) that hopes that someday humans may live and work on other planets within the Solar System. The vision statement of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) includes planetary exploration and human spaceflight. While a leader in several fields of space science, India is yet to initiate serious research in gravitational and life sciences. Suggestions are made here for establishing a full-fledged Indian space life sciences programme.</p>

				<title>Ribosome evolution: Emergence of peptide synthesis machinery</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0921-0928</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Proteins, the main players in current biological systems, are produced on ribosomes by sequential amide bond (peptide bond) formations between amino-acid-bearing tRNAs. The ribosome is an exquisite super-complex of RNA-proteins, containing more than 50 proteins and at least 3 kinds of RNAs. The combination of a variety of side chains of amino acids (typically 20 kinds with some exceptions) confers proteins with extraordinary structure and functions. The origin of peptide bond formation and the ribosome is crucial to the understanding of life itself. In this article, a possible evolutionary pathway to peptide bond formation machinery (proto-ribosome) will be discussed, with a special focus on the RNA minihelix (primordial form of modern tRNA) as a starting molecule. Combining the present data with recent experimental data, we can infer that the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) evolved from a primitive system in the RNA world comprising tRNA-like molecules formed by duplication of minihelix-like small RNA.</p>

				<title>Reviewing host proteins of Rhabdoviridae: Possible leads for lesser studied viruses</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0929-0937</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rhabdoviridae, characterized by bullet-shaped viruses, is known for its diverse host range, which includes plants, arthropods, fishes and humans. Understanding the viral–host interactions of this family can prove beneficial in developing effective therapeutic strategies. The host proteins interacting with animal rhabdoviruses have been reviewed in this report. Several important host proteins commonly interacting with animal rhabdoviruses are being reported, some of which, interestingly, have molecular features, which can serve as potential antiviral targets. This review not only provides the generalized importance of the functions of animal rhabdovirus-associated host proteins for the first time but also compares them among the two most studied viruses, i.e. Rabies virus (RV) and Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV). The comparative data can be used for studying emerging viruses such as Chandipura virus (CHPV) and the lesser studied viruses such as Piry virus (PIRYV) and Isfahan virus (ISFV) of the Rhabdoviridae family.</p>

				<title>Anhydrobiosis in bacteria: From physiology to applications</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0939-0950</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Anhydrobiosis is a phenomenon related to the partial or total desiccation of living organisms, keeping their vital functions after rehydration. The desiccated state in prokaryotes has been widely studied, mainly due to the broad spectrum of the anhydrobiosis applications. In this review, we present the basic theoretical concepts related to anhydrobiosis, focusing on bacterial species. An update about desiccation tolerance in bacteria is given; and the general mechanisms of desiccation tolerance and desiccation damage are described. In addition, we show how the study of anhydrobiosis in prokaryotes has established the theoretical and practical basis for the development of the drying technologies. With regard to the desiccation tolerance in bacteria, although many mechanisms remain undiscovered at the molecular level, important research about the physiology of the anhydrobiotic state and its applications has been performed, and here we provide the most recent information about this subject. On the other hand, the most widely used drying technologies and their particular applications in several fields are described (e.g. medicine, agriculture and food industry). Finally, topics on the stability of desiccated bacterial cells are treated, concluding with the necessity of focusing the research on the mathematical modelling of the desiccated state in bacteria.</p>

				<title>Physiological roles of plastid terminal oxidase in plant stress responses</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0951-0956</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) is a plastoquinol oxidase localized in the plastids of plants. It is able to transfer electrons from plastoquinone (PQ) to molecular oxygen with the formation of water. Recent studies have suggested that PTOX is beneficial for plants under environmental stresses, since it is involved in the synthesis of photoprotective carotenoids and chlororespiration, which could potentially protect the chloroplast electron transport chain (ETC) from over-reduction. The absence of PTOX in plants usually results in photo-bleached variegated leaves and impaired adaptation to environment alteration. Although PTOX level and activity has been found to increase under a wide range of stress conditions, the functions of plant PTOX in stress responses are still disputed now. In this paper, the possible physiological roles of PTOX in plant stress responses are discussed based on the recent progress.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Although questioned on several occasions, the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been confirmed by a number of studies on experimental animal models. Nevertheless, it was shown that CSC hypotheses have several limitations and inconsistencies regarding the explanation of CSC origin, CSC identification and isolation, possible heterogeneity within CSC population, as well as methodology issues in some studies that were carried out in order to prove CSC existence. The aim of this article is to give a short and comprehensive review of recent advances concerning CSC hypothesis and to describe its impact on modern molecular physiology and pharmacology research.</p>

				<title>Plant functional traits with particular reference to tropical deciduous forests: A review</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0963-0981</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Functional traits (FTs) integrate the ecological and evolutionary history of a species, and can potentially be used to predict its response as well as its influence on ecosystem functioning. Study of inter-specific variation in the FTs of plants aids in classifying species into plant functional types (PFTs) and provides insights into fundamental patterns and trade-offs in plant form and functioning and the effect of changing species composition on ecosystem functions. Specifically, this paper focuses on those FTs that make a species successful in the dry tropical environment. Following a brief overview, we discuss plant FTs that may be particularly relevant to tropical deciduous forests (TDFs). We consider the traits under the following categories: leaf traits, stem and root traits, reproductive traits, and traits particularly relevant to water availability. We compile quantitative information on functional traits of dry tropical forest species. We also discuss trait-based grouping of plants into PFTs. We recognize that there is incomplete knowledge about many FTs and their effects on TDFs and point out the need for further research on PFTs of TDF species, which can enable prediction of the dynamics of these forests in the face of disturbance and global climate change. Correlations between structural and ecophysiological traits and ecosystem functioning should also be established which could make it possible to generate predictions of changes in ecosystem services from changes in functional composition.</p>

					<p>Flanking regulatory long terminal repeats (LTRs) in <i>Human endogenous retrovirus</i> (HERV) is a kind of typical DNA repeat that is widespread in the human genome. Currently, many algorithms have been developed to detect the latent periodicity of a wide range of DNA repeats. However, no such attempt was made for HERV LTRs. The present study focused on the investigation of the possible sequence periodic patterns in the HERV LTRs and their regulatory mechanisms. We calculated the sequence periods of 5&#8242;, 3&#8242; and combined LTRs in HERVs with our devised matrix simulation algorithm. It is interesting that 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; LTRs have the same period of 7, and combined LTRs have a period of 9. These results indicated that HERV LTRs have predominant periodic patterns. Based on the obtained sequence periodicity, we constructed periodic consensus sequences of 5&#8242;, 3&#8242; and combined LTRs. As to 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; LTRs with the same period – 7, we manually scanned the nucleotide bases in the corresponding positions of their periodic consensus sequences, and found some positions have the nucleotide base unchanged, such as the 1st, 5th and 7th positions. These conservative nucleotide base positions represent critical binding sites of regulatory LTRs, and may be indicative of conserved regulatory mechanisms in LRT-participating regulatory networks.</p>

				<title>TP53 codon 72 polymorphism in pigmentary phenotypes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0033-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The p53 protein exerts different cellular functions, and recent findings have demonstrated its influence on the cascade of skin pigmentation during UV exposure. Among <i>TP53</i> gene polymorphisms, the most studied is the G to C transversion in exon 4 at codon 72, which results in three distinct genotypes, Arg/Arg, Pro/Pro and Arg/Pro, each one encoding different p53 isoforms. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and skin protection against sunburn. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and genotyping was performed by PCR and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. The genotype frequency was 50% for Arg/Arg and 14.6% for Pro/Pro genotype. The frequency of heterozygous subjects was 35.4%. In our population, p53 genotypes were in Hardy–Weinberg (HW) equilibrium ($\chi^{2}_{\text{HM}}$ &#60; 3.84), showing a predominance of arginine allele (total Arg allele frequency of 68%). No significant association between p53 genotype and skin colour, hair or eye colour and susceptibility to sun exposure was found. However, further analysis demonstrated a significant association between the genotype Pro/Pro and blue/green eyes among participants who presented redness (𝑃=0.016). Our findings indicate susceptibility to sun exposure when this phenotype (eye colour) occurs simultaneously with Pro/Pro genotype.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0041-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>CD44, an adhesion molecule, has been reported to be a binding site for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M. tuberculosis</i>) in macrophages and it also mediates mycobacterial phagocytosis, macrophage recruitment and protective immunity against pulmonary tuberculosis <i>in vivo</i>. However, the signalling pathways that are involved in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>–induced CD44 surface expression in monocytic cells are currently unknown. Exposure of THP-1 human monocytes to <i>M. tuberculosis</i> H37Rv and H37Ra induced distinct, time-dependent, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3/6, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun N-terminal kinases. The strains also differed in their usage of CD14 and human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) receptors in mediating mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. <i>M. tuberculosis</i> H37Rv strain induced lower CD44 surface expression and tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels, whereas H37Ra the reverse. Using highly specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-jun N-terminal kinase, we report that inhibition of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 and c-jun N-terminal kinases increases, but that inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase decreases <i>M. tuberculosis</i>–induced CD44 surface expression in THP-1 human monocytes.</p>

				<title>Aged mice have increased inflammatory monocyte concentration and altered expression of cell-surface functional receptors</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0055-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The expression of monocyte cell-surface receptors represents one index of immune dysfunction, which is common with aging. Although mouse models of aging are prevalent, monocyte subset assessment is rare. Our purpose was to compare cell receptor expression on classic (CD115<sup>+</sup>/Gr-1<sup>high</sup>) and non-classic (CD115<sup>+</sup>/Gr-1<sup>low</sup>) monocytes from 80- or 20-week-old CD-1 mice. Three-colour flow cytometry was used to determine the concentration of monocyte subsets and their respective cell-surface expression of TLR2, TLR4, CD80, CD86, MHC II and CD54. These receptors were selected because they have been previously associated with altered monocyte function. Data were analysed with independent 𝑡-tests; significance was set at 𝑃 &#60; 0.05. Old mice had a greater concentration of both classic (258%, 𝑃=0.003) and non-classic (70%, 𝑃=0.026) monocytes. The classic : non-classic monocyte ratio doubled in old as compared with that in young mice (𝑃=0.006), indicating a pro-inflammatory shift. TLR4 ($\downarrow$27%, 𝑃=0.001) and CD80 ($\downarrow$37%, 𝑃=0.004) were decreased on classic monocytes from old as compared with those from young mice. TLR2 ($\uparrow$24%, 𝑃=0.002) and MHCII ($\downarrow$21%, 𝑃=0.026) were altered on non-classic monocytes from old as compared with those from young mice. The increased classic : non-classic monocyte ratio combined with changes in the cell-surface receptor expression on both monocyte subsets is indicative of immune dysfunction, which may increase age-associated disease risk.</p>

				<title>High prevalence of oncogenic HPV-16 in cervical smears of asymptomatic women of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India: A population-based study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0063-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In developing countries like India, occurrence of <i>Human papillomavirus</i> (HPV) in cervical cancer as well as in the asymptomatic population was observed to be very high. Studies on HPV prevalence have been conducted in different parts of the country but no data were available from the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh (UP). The present study aimed to determine the status of HPV prevalence and its association with different socio-demographic factors in this population. Prevalence of HPV was investigated in a total of 2424 cervical scrape samples of asymptomatic women. Primer sets from L1 consensus region of viral genome were used to detect the presence of HPV, and the positive samples were genotyped by sequencing. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate association of socio-demographic factors with HPV. 9.9% of the clinically asymptomatic women were found to be infected with HPV comprising 26 different genotypes. Among HPV-positive women, 80.8% showed single infection, while 15.4% harboured multiple infections. HPV-16 (63.7%) was the most prevalent, followed by HPV-31 (6.7%), HPV-6 (5.4%), HPV-81 (4.6%) and HPV-33 (4.2%). Significant association of HPV with non-vegetarian diet (𝑃 &#60; 0.05) and rural residential areas (𝑃 &#60; 0.01) were observed. High prevalence of HPV-16 in asymptomatic women of this population, a frequency comparable to invasive cervical cancers, highlights an urgent need for a therapeutic HPV vaccine covering HPV-16 and other high-risk types to provide protection against the disease.</p>

				<title>Cytotoxic effects of the novel isoflavone, phenoxodiol, on prostate cancer cell lines</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0073-0084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Phenoxodiol is an isoflavone derivative that has been shown to elicit cytotoxic effects against a broad range of human cancers. We examined the effect of phenoxodiol on cell death pathways on the prostate cell lines LNCaP, DU145 and PC3, representative of different stages of prostate cancer, and its effects on cell death pathways in these cell lines. Cell proliferation assays demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of cell proliferation after 48 h exposure to phenoxodiol (10 and 30 𝜇M). FACS analysis and 3&#8242;-end labelling indicated that all three prostate cancer cell lines underwent substantial levels of cell death 48 h after treatment. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization, indicative of early-stage cell death signalling, using JC-1 detection, was also apparent in all cell lines after exposure to phenoxodiol in the absence of caspase-3 activation. Caspase inhibition assays indicated that phenoxodiol operates through a caspase-independent cell death pathway. These data demonstrate that phenoxodiol elicits anti-cancer effects in prostate cancer cell lines representative of early and later stages of development through an as-yet-unknown cell death mechanism. These data warrant the further investigation of phenoxodiol as a potential treatment for prostate cancer.</p>

				<title>Differential expression of <i>ZFX</i> gene in gastric cancer</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0085-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gastric cancer accounts for 8% of the total cancer cases and 10% of total cancer deaths worldwide. In Iran, gastric cancer is the leading cause of national cancer-related mortality. Most human cancers show substantial heterogeneity. The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis has been proposed to reconcile this heterogeneity. <i>ZFX</i> encodes a member of the krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family that is required as a transcriptional regulator for self-renewal of stem cells. A total of 30 paired tissue gastric samples were examined for <i>ZFX</i> gene expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Although the relative expression of the gene was significantly high in 47% of the examined tumour tissues, its expression was low in the others (53%). There was a statistically significant association between the <i>ZFX</i> gene expression and different tumour types and grades. This is the first report that shows <i>ZFX</i> was differentially expressed in gastric cancer. Of note, it was overexpressed in diffused-type and grade III gastric tumoural tissues. Due to this, <i>ZFX</i> may have the potential to be used as a target for therapeutic interventions.</p>

				<title>Leptin regulates proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal carcinoma through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0091-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity is associated with colorectal cancer. The obesity hormone leptin is considered as a key mediator for cancer development and progression. The present study aims to investigate regulatory effects of leptin on colorectal carcinoma. The expression of leptin and its receptor Ob-R was examined by immunohistochemistry in 108 Chinese patients with colorectal carcinoma. The results showed that leptin/Ob-R expression was significantly associated with T stage, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, differentiation and expression of p-mTOR, p-70S6 kinase, and p-Akt. Furthermore, the effects of leptin on proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells were determined. The results showed that leptin could stimulate the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of HCT-116 colon cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Ly294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) and rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) could prevent the regulatory effects of leptin on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 cells via abrogating leptin-mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. All these results indicated that leptin could regulate proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal carcinoma through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway.</p>

				<title>Expression, purification and characterization of the interferon-inducible, antiviral and tumour-suppressor protein, human RNase L</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0103-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interferon (IFN)-inducible, 2&#8242;,5&#8242;-oligoadenylate (2-5A)-dependent ribonuclease L (RNase L) plays key role in antiviral defense of mammalian cells. Induction by IFN and activation by double-stranded RNA lead to 2-5A cofactor synthesis, which activates RNase L by causing its dimerization. Active RNase L degrades single-stranded viral as well as cellular RNAs causing apoptosis of virus-infected cells. Earlier, we had reported that expression of recombinant human RNase L caused RNA-degradation and cell-growth inhibition in <i>E. coli</i> without the need for exogenous 2-5A. Expression of human RNase L in <i>E. coli</i> usually leads to problems of leaky expression, low yield and degradation of the recombinant protein, which demands number of chromatographic steps for its subsequent purification thereby, compromising its biochemical activity. Here, we report a convenient protocol for expression of full-length, soluble and biochemically active recombinant human RNase L as GST-R Nase L fusion protein from <i>E. coli</i> utilizing a single-step affinity purification with an appreciable yield of the highly purified protein. Recombinant R Nase L was characterized by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and MALDI-TOF analysis. A semi-quantitative agarose-gel-based ribonuclease assay was developed for measuring its 2-5A-dependent R Nase L activity against cellular large rRNAs as substrates. The optimized expression conditions minimized degradation of the protein, making it a convenient method for purification of R Nase L, which can be utilized to study effects of various agents on the R Nase L activity and its protein–protein interactions.</p>

				<title>Corticoadrenal activity in rat regulates betaine-homocysteine <i>S</i>-methyltransferase expression with opposite effects in liver and kidney</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0115-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Betaine-homocysteine 𝑆-methyltransferase (BHMT) is an enzyme that converts homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine using betaine as a methyl donor. Betaine also acts as osmolyte in kidney medulla, protecting cells from high extracellular osmolarity. Hepatic BHMT expression is regulated by salt intake. Hormones, particularly corticosteroids, also regulate BHMT expression in rat liver. We investigated to know whether the corticoadrenal activity plays a role in kidney BHMT expression. BHMT activity in rat kidneys is several orders of magnitude lower than in rat livers and only restricted to the renal cortex. This study confirms that corticosteroids stimulate BHMT activity in the liver and, for the first time in an animal model, also up-regulate the BHMT gene expression. Besides, unlike the liver, corticosteroids in rat kidney down-regulate BHMT expression and activity. Given that the classical effect of adrenocortical activity on the kidney is associated with sodium and water re-absorption by the distal tubule leading to volume expansion, by promoting lesser use of betaine as a methyl donor, corticosteroids would preserve betaine for its other role as osmoprotectant against changes in the extracellular osmotic conditions. We conclude that corticosteroids are, at least in part, responsible for the inhibition of BHMT expression and activity in rat kidneys.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transient expression of foreign genes based on plant viral vectors is a suitable system for the production of relevant immunogens that can be used for the development of a new generation of vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases. In the present study the epitope derived from HPV-16 L2 minor capsid protein (amino acids 108–120) was expressed from <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-based vector pGR106 as N- or C-terminal fusion with the PVX coat protein (PVX CP) in transgenic <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> plants. The fusion protein L2<sub>108-120</sub>-PVX CP was successfully expressed in plants at a level of 170 mg/kg of fresh leaf tissue. The C-terminal fusion protein PVX CP- L2<sub>108-120</sub> was expressed using mutated vector sequence to avoid homologous recombination at a level of 8 mg/kg of fresh leaf tissue. Immunogenicity of L2<sub>108-120</sub>-PVX CP virus-like particles was tested after immunization of mice by subcutaneous injection or tattoo administration. In animal sera the antibodies against the PVX CP and the L2<sub>108-120</sub> epitope were found after both methods of vaccine delivery.</p>

				<title>Development of transgenic finger millet (<i>Eleusine coracana</i> (L.) Gaertn.) resistant to leaf blast disease</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0135-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Finger millet plants conferring resistance to leaf blast disease have been developed by inserting a rice chitinase (<i>chi</i>11) gene through <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. Plasmid pHyg-Chi.11 harbouring the rice chitinase gene under the control of maize ubiquitin promoter was introduced into finger millet using <i>Agrobacterium</i> strain LBA4404 (pSB1). Transformed plants were selected and regenerated on hygromycin-supplemented medium. Transient expression of transgene was confirmed by GUS histochemical staining. The incorporation of rice chitinase gene in R<sub>0</sub> and R<sub>1</sub> progenies was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. Expression of chitinase gene in finger millet was confirmed by Western blot analysis with a barley chitinase antibody. A leaf blast assay was also performed by challenging the transgenic plants with spores of <i>Pyricularia grisea</i>. The frequency of transient expression was 16.3% to 19.3%. Stable frequency was 3.5% to 3.9%. Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of 3.1 kb chitinase gene. Western blot analysis detected the presence of 35 kDa chitinase enzyme. Chitinase activity ranged from 19.4 to 24.8. In segregation analysis, the transgenic R<sub>1</sub> lines produced three resistant and one sensitive for hygromycin, confirming the normal Mendelian pattern of transgene segregation. Transgenic plants showed high level of resistance to leaf blast disease compared to control plants. This is the first study reporting the introduction of rice chitinase gene into finger millet for leaf blast resistance.</p>

				<title>Molecular cytogenetic identification of a novel dwarf wheat line with introgressed <i>Thinopyrum ponticum</i> chromatin</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0149-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Novel dwarfing germplasms and dwarfing genes are valuable for the wheat breeding. A novel semi-dwarf line, 31505-1, with reduced height compared with its common wheat parent, was derived from a cross between common wheat and <i>Thinopyrum ponticum</i>. Cytological studies demonstrated that 31505-1 contained 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genomic <i>in situ</i> hybridization (GISH) analysis showed that 31505-1 had no large <i>Th. ponticum</i> chromosome fragments. Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) results revealed the absence of a pAs1 hybridization band on 2DL chromosome of 31505-1. Two SSR markers (<i>Xwmc41</i> and <i>Xcfd168</i>) and two STS markers (<i>Xmag4059</i> and <i>Xmag3596</i>), which were located on 2D chromosome, amplified unique bands of <i>Th. Ponticum</i> in 31505-1. These revealed presence of an introgressed <i>Th. ponticum</i> segment in 2DL chromosome of dwarf line 31505-1, although the alien segment could not be detected by GISH.</p>

				<title>Autophagy: A double-edged sword in Alzheimer's disease</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0157-0165</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Autophagy is a major protein degradation pathway that is essential for stress-induced and constitutive protein turnover. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that amyloid-𝛽 (A𝛽) protein can be generated in autophagic vacuoles, promoting its extracellular deposition in neuritic plaques as the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The molecular machinery for A𝛽 generation, including APP, APP-C99 and 𝛽-/𝛾-secretases, are all enriched in autophagic vacuoles. The induction of autophagy can be vividly observed in the brain at early stages of sporadic AD and in an AD transgenic mouse model. Accumulated evidence has also demonstrated a neuroprotective role of autophagy in mediating the degradation of aggregated proteins that are causative of various neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is thus widely regarded as an intracellular hub for the removal of the detrimental A𝛽 peptides and Tau aggregates. Nonetheless, compelling data also reveal an unfavorable function of autophagy in facilitating the production of intracellular A𝛽. The two faces of autophagy on the homeostasis of A𝛽 place it in a very unique and intriguing position in ADpathogenesis. This article briefly summarizes seminal discoveries that are shedding new light on the critical and unique roles of autophagy in AD and potential therapeutic approaches against autophagy-elicited AD.</p>

				<title>Recent advances in development of marker-free transgenic plants: Regulation and biosafety concern</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0167-0197</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the efficient genetic transformation of plants with the gene of interest, some selectable marker genes are also used in order to identify the transgenic plant cells or tissues. Usually, antibiotic- or herbicide-selective agents and their corresponding resistance genes are used to introduce economically valuable genes into crop plants. From the biosafety authority and consumer viewpoints, the presence of selectable marker genes in released transgenic crops may be transferred to weeds or pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract or soil, making them resistant to treatment with herbicides or antibiotics, respectively. Sexual crossing also raises the problem of transgene expression because redundancy of transgenes in the genome may trigger homology-dependent gene silencing. The future potential of transgenic technologies for crop improvement depends greatly on our abilities to engineer stable expression of multiple transgenic traits in a predictable fashion and to prevent the transfer of undesirable transgenic material to non-transgenic crops and related species. Therefore, it is now essential to develop an efficient marker-free transgenic system. These considerations underline the development of various approaches designed to facilitate timely elimination of transgenes when their function is no longer needed. Due to the limiting number of available selectable marker genes, in future the stacking of transgenes will be increasingly desirable. The production of marker-free transgenic plants is now a critical requisite for their commercial deployment and also for engineering multiple and complex trait. Here we describe the current technologies to eliminate the selectablemarker genes (SMG) in order to develop marker-free transgenic plants and also discuss the regulation and biosafety concern of genetically modified (GM) crops.</p>

				<title>Molecular typing of fecal eukaryotic microbiota of human infants and their respective mothers</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0221-0226</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The micro-eukaryotic diversity from the human gut was investigated using universal primers directed towards <i>18S rRNA</i> gene, fecal samples being the source of DNA. The subjects in this study included two breast-fed and two formula-milk-fed infants and their mothers. The study revealed that the infants did not seem to harbour any micro-eukaryotes in their gut. In contrast, there were distinct eukaryotic microbiota present in the mothers. The investigation is the first of its kind in the comparative study of the human feces to reveal the presence of micro-eukaryotic diversity variance in infants and adults from the Indian subcontinent. The micro-eukaryotes encountered during the investigation include known gut colonizers like <i>Blastocystis</i> and some fungi species. Some of these micro-eukaryotes have been speculated to be involved in clinical manifestations of various diseases. The study is an attempt to highlight the importance of micro-eukaryotes in the human gut.</p>

				<title>Neuropeptide Y gene expression around meal time in the Brazilian flounder <i>Paralichthys orbignyanus</i></title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0227-0232</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is considered the major stimulant for food intake in mammals and fish. Previous results indicate that NPY is involved in the feeding behaviour of the Brazilian flounder, <i>Paralichthys orbignyanus</i>. In this study, we evaluated hypothalamic NPY expression before (−2 h), during (0 h) and after feeding (+2 h) in two independent experiments: (1) during a normal feeding schedule and (2) in fish fasted for 2 weeks. During normal feeding, changes in the levels of NPY mRNA were periprandial, with expression levels being significantly elevated at meal time (𝑃 &#60; 0.05) and significantly reduced 2 h later (𝑃&#60; 0.05). Comparing the fasting and unfasted groups, NPY mRNA levels were significantly higher (𝑃 &#60; 0.05) at −2 h and +2 h in the fasting group, but there was no difference at 0 h. In addition, the higher NPY mRNA levels that were observed in the fasting group were maintained throughout the sampling period. In summary, our results show that NPY expression was associated with meal time (0 h) in food intake regulation.</p>

				<title>Effect of LNA- and OMeN-modified oligonucleotide probes on the stability and discrimination of mismatched base pairs of duplexes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0233-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Locked nucleic acid (LNA) and 2&#8242;-𝑂-methyl nucleotide (OMeN) are the most extensively studied nucleotide analogues. Although both LNA and OMeN are characterized by the <i>C3</i>&#8242;-<i>endo</i> sugar pucker conformation, which is dominant in A-form DNA and RNA nucleotides, they demonstrate different binding behaviours. Previous studies have focused attention on their properties of duplex stabilities, hybridization kinetics and resistance against nuclease digestion; however, their ability to discriminate mismatched hybridizations has been explored much less. In this study, LNA- and OMeN-modified oligonucleotide probes have been prepared and their effects on the DNA duplex stability have been examined: LNA modifications can enhance the duplex stability, whereas OMeN modifications reduce the duplex stability. Next, we studied how the LNA:DNA and OMeN:DNA mismatches reduced the duplex stability. Melting temperature measurement showed that different LNA:DNA or OMeN:DNA mismatches indeed influence the duplex stability differently. LNA purines can discriminate LNA:DNA mismatches more effectively than LNA pyrimidines as well as DNA nucleotides. Furthermore, we designed five LNA- and five OMeN-modified oligonucleotide probes to simulate realistic situations where target–probe duplexes contain a complementary LNA:DNA or OMeN:DNA base pairs and a DNA:DNA mismatch simultaneously. The measured collective effect showed that the duplex stability was enhanced by the complementary LNA:DNA base pair but decreased by the DNA:DNA mismatch in a position-dependent manner regardless of the chemical identity and position of the complementary LNA:DNA base pair. On the other hand, the OMeN-modified probes also showed that the duplex stability was reduced by both the OMeN modification and the OMeN:DNA mismatch in a position-dependent manner.</p>

				<title>STAT3 mutations correlated with hyper-IgE syndrome lead to blockage of IL-6/STAT3 signalling pathway</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0243-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Of all the causes identified for the disease hyper-immunoglobulinemia E syndrome (HIES), a homozygous mutation in tyrosine kinase2 (TYK2) and heterozygous mutations in STAT3 are implicated the defects in Jak/STAT signalling pathway in the pathogenesis of HIES. Mutations of STAT3 have been frequently clinically identified in autosomal-dominant (AD) HIES patients’ cells, and therefore, the genotype of STAT3 has been associated with the phenotype of HIES. Here, we conducted studies on the functional loss of the seven specific STAT3 mutations correlated with ADHIES. Using STAT3-null human colon carcinoma cell line A4 cells, we generated seven mutants of STAT3 bearing single mutations clinically identified in AD-HIES patients’ cells and studied the functional loss of these mutants in IL-6-Jak/STAT3 signalling pathway. Our results show that five STAT3 mutants bearing mutations in the DNA-binding domain maintain the phosphorylation of Tyr705 and the ability of dimerization while the other two with mutations in SH2 domain are devoid of the phosphorylation of Try705 and abrogate the dimerization in response to IL-6. The phosphorylation of Ser727 in these mutants shows diversity in response to IL-6. These mutations eventually converge on the abnormalities of the IL-6/Gp130/Jak2-mediated STAT3 transactivation on target genes, indicative of the dysregulation of JAK/STAT signalling present in HIES.</p>

				<title>Characterization of P1 promoter activity of the 𝛽-galactoside 𝛼2,6-sialyltransferase I gene (<i>siat 1</i>) in cervical and hepatic cancer cell lines</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0259-0267</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The level of 𝛽-galactoside 𝛼2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal I) mRNA, encoded by the gene <i>siat1</i>, is increased in malignant tissues. Expression is regulated by different promoters – P1, P2 and P3 – generating three mRNA isoforms H, X and YZ. In cervical cancer tissue the mRNA isoform H, which results from P1 promoter activity, is increased. To study the regulation of P1 promoter, different constructs from P1 promoter were evaluated by luciferase assays in cervical and hepatic cell lines. Deletion of a fragment of 1048 bp (−89 to +24 bp) increased 5- and 3-fold the promoter activity in C33A and HepG2 cell lines, respectively. The minimal region with promoter activity was a 37 bp fragment in C33A cells. The activity of this region does not require the presence of an initiator sequence. In HepG2 cells the minimal promoter activity was detected in the 66 bp fragment. Sp1 (−32) mutation increased the promoter activity only in HepG2 cells. HNF1 mutation decreased promoter activity in HepG2 cell line but not in C33A cells. We identified a large region that plays a negative regulation role. The regulation of promoter activity is cell type specific. Our study provides new insights into the complex transcriptional regulation of <i>siat1</i> gene.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0269-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Acacia nilotica</i> proteinase inhibitor (AnPI) was isolated by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and resulted in a purification of 10.68-fold with a 19.5% yield. Electrophoretic analysis of purified AnPI protein resolved into a single band with molecular weight of approximately 18.6+1.00 kDa. AnPI had high stability at different pH values (2.0 to 10.0) except at pH 5.0 and are thermolabile beyond 80&#176;C for 10 min. AnPI exhibited effective against total proteolytic activity and trypsin-like activity, but did not show any inhibitory effect on chymotrypsin activity of midgut of <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>. The inhibition kinetics studies against <i>H. armigera</i> gut trypsin are of non-competitive type. AnPI had low affinity for <i>H. armigera</i> gut trypsin when compared to SBTI. The partially purified and purified PI proteins-incorporated test diets showed significant reduction in mean larval and pupal weight of <i>H. armigera</i>. The results provide important clues in designing strategies by using the proteinase inhibitors (PIs) from the <i>A. nilotica</i> that can be expressed in genetically engineered plants to confer resistance to <i>H. armigera</i>.</p>

				<title>Quercetin modulates activities of Taiwan cobra phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> via its effects on membrane structure and membrane-bound mode of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub></title>

				<page>0277-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The goal of the present study is to elucidate the mechanism of quercetin on modulating <i>Naja naja</i> atra phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activities. Sphingomyelin inhibited PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymatic activity and membrane-damaging activity against egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC), while cholesterol and quercetin abrogated the sphingomeyelin inhibitory effect. Quercetin incorporation led to a reduction in PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymatic activity and membrane-damaging activity toward EYPC/sphingomyelin/cholesterol vesicles. Both cholesterol and quercetin increased detergent resistance and reduced membrane fluidity of EYPC/sphingomyelin vesicles. Quercetin reduced detergent insolubility but increased ordered lipid packing of EYPC/sphingomyelin/cholesterol vesicles. Acrylamide quenching studies and trinitrophenylation of Lys residues revealed that quercetin altered the membrane-bound mode of PLA<sub>2</sub> differently upon absorption onto the membrane bilayers of different lipid compositions. However, 8-anilinonaphthalene sulphonate-binding assay revealed that quercetin marginally affected the interaction between active site of PLA<sub>2</sub> with phospholipid vesicles. Collectively, our data indicate that membrane-inserted quercetin modulates PLA<sub>2</sub> interfacial activity and membrane-damaging activity via its effects on membrane structure and membrane-bound mode of PLA<sub>2</sub>.</p>

				<title>Insights into eisosome assembly and organization</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0295-0300</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eisosomes, large protein complexes that are predominantly composed of BAR-domain-containing proteins Pil1 and its homologs, are situated under the plasma membrane of ascomycetes. A successful targeting of Pil1 onto the future site of eisosome accompanies maturation of eisosome. During or after recruitment, Pil1 undergoes self-assembly into filaments that can serve as scaffolds to induce membrane furrows or invaginations. Although a consequence of the invagination is likely to redistribute particular proteins and lipids to a different location, the precise physiological role of membrane invagination and eisosome assembly awaits further investigation. The present review summarizes recent research findings within the field regarding the detailed structural and functional significance of Pil1 on eisosome organization.</p>

				<title>Nucleic acids in circulation: Are they harmful to the host?</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0301-0312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been estimated that 10<sup>11</sup>–10<sup>12</sup> cells, primarily of haematogenous origin, die in the adult human body daily, and a similar number is regenerated to maintain homeostasis. Despite the presence of an efficient scavenging system for dead cells, considerable amounts of fragmented genetic material enter the circulation in healthy individuals. Elevated blood levels of extracellular nucleic acids have been reported in various disease conditions; such as ageing and age-related degenerative disorders, cancer; acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, severe trauma and autoimmune disorders. In addition to genomic DNA and nucleosomes, mitochondrial DNA is also found in circulation, as are RNA and microRNA. There is extensive literature that suggests that extraneously added nucleic acids have biological actions. They can enter into cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and induce genetic transformation and cellular and chromosomal damage; and experimentally added nucleic acids are capable of activating both innate and adaptive immune systems and inducing a sterile inflammatory response. The possibility as to whether circulating nucleic acids may, likewise, have biological activities has not been explored. In this review we raise the question as to whether circulating nucleic acids may have damaging effects on the host and be implicated in ageing and diverse acute and chronic human pathologies.</p>

Subsequently, PQQ was shown to be an antioxidant protecting the living cells from oxidative damage <i>in vivo</i> and the biomolecules from artificially produced reaction oxygen species <i>in vitro</i>. The presence of PQQ has been documented from different biological samples. It functions as a nutrient and vitamin for supporting the growth and protection of living cells under stress. Recently, the role of PQQ has also been shown as a bio-control agent for plant fungal pathogens, an inducer for proteins kinases involved in cellular differentiation of mammalian cells and as a redox sensor leading to development of biosensor. Recent reviews published on PQQ and enzymes requiring this cofactor have brought forth the case specific roles of PQQ. This review covers the comprehensive information on various aspects of PQQ known till date. These include the roles of PQQ in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation in mammalian system, as a nutrient and vitamin in stress tolerance, in crop productivity through increasing the availability of insoluble phosphate and as a bio-control agent, and as a redox agent leading to the biosensor development. Most recent findings correlating the exceptionally high redox recycling ability of PQQ to its potential as anti-neurodegenerative, anticancer and pharmacological agents, and as a signalling molecule have been distinctly brought out. This review discusses different findings suggesting the versatility in PQQ functions and provides the most plausible intellectual basis to the ubiquitous roles of this compound in a large number of biological processes, as a nutrient and a perspective vitamin.</p>

				<title>Invertebrate lysozymes: Diversity and distribution, molecular mechanism and <i>in vivo</i> function</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0327-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lysozymes are antibacterial enzymes widely distributed among organisms. Within the animal kingdom, mainly three major lysozyme types occur. Chicken (c)-type lysozyme and goose (g)-type lysozyme are predominantly, but not exclusively, found in vertebrate animals, while the invertebrate (i)-type lysozyme is typical for invertebrate organisms, and hence its name. Since their discovery in 1975, numerous research articles report on the identification of i-type lysozymes in a variety of invertebrate phyla. This review describes the current knowledge on i-type lysozymes, outlining their distribution, molecular mechanism and <i>in vivo</i> function taking the representative from <i>Venerupis philippinarum</i> (formerly <i>Tapes japonica</i>) (Vp-ilys) as a model. In addition, invertebrate g-type and ch-type (chalaropsis) lysozymes, which have been described in molluscs and nematodes, respectively, are also briefly discussed.</p>

				<title>Mammary gland stem cells: More puzzles than explanations</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0349-0358</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mammary gland stem cells (MaSC) have not been identified in spite of extensive research spanning over several decades. This has been primarily due to the complexity of mammary gland structure and its development, cell heterogeneity in the mammary gland and the insufficient knowledge about MaSC markers. At present, Lin<sup>–</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup>CD49f<sup>hi</sup>CD24<sup>+/mod</sup>Sca-1<sup>–</sup> cells of the mammary gland have been reported to be enriched with MaSCs. We suggest that the inclusion of stem cell markers like Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and the mammary gland differentiation marker BRCA-1 may further narrow down the search for MaSCs. In addition, we have discussed some of the other unresolved puzzles on the mammary gland stem cells, such as their similarities and/or differences with mammary cancer stem cells, use of milk as source of mammary stem cells and the possibility of in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into functional mammary gland structures in this review. Nevertheless, it is the lack of identity for a MaSC that is curtailing the advances in some of the above and other related areas.</p>

				<title>Behavioural reproductive isolation and speciation in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0359-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The origin of premating reproductive isolation continues to help elucidate the process of speciation and is the central event in the evolution of biological species. Therefore, during the process of species formation the diverging populations must acquire some means of reproductive isolation so that the genes from one gene pool are prevented from dispersing freely into a foreign gene pool. In the genus <i>Drosophila</i>, the phenomenon of behavioural reproductive isolation, which is an important type of premating (prezygotic) reproductive isolating mechanisms, has been extensively studied and interesting data have been documented. In many cases incomplete sexual isolation has been observed and the pattern and degree of isolation within and between the species have often been used to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships. The present review documents an overview of speciation mediated through behavioural incompatibility in different species groups of <i>Drosophila</i> with particular reference to the models proposed on the basis of one-sided ethological isolation to predict the direction of evolution. This study is crucial for understanding the mechanism of speciation through behavioural incompatibility and also for an understanding of speciation genetics in future prospects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article provides a retrospective on the ABC initiative in the area of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including explicit solvent on all tetranucleotide steps of duplex B-form DNA duplex, ca. 2012. The ABC consortium has completed two phases of simulations, the most current being a set of 50–100 trajectories based on the <i>AMBER ff99</i> force field together with the <i>parmbsc0</i> modification. Some general perspectives on the field of MD on DNA and sequence effects on DNA structure are provided, followed by an overview our MD results, including a detailed comparison of the <i>ff99/parmbsc0</i> results with crystal and NMR structures available for d(CGCGAATTCGCG). Some projects inspired by or related to the ABC initiative and database are also reviewed, including methods for the trajectory analyses, informatics of dealing with the large database of results, compressions of trajectories for efficacy of distribution, DNA solvation by water and ions, parameterization of coarse-grained models with applications and gene finding and genome annotation</p>

				<title>Studies of base pair sequence effects on DNA solvation based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0399-0421</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Detailed analyses of the sequence-dependent solvation and ion atmosphere of DNA are presented based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on all the 136 unique tetranucleotide steps obtained by the ABC consortium using the AMBER suite of programs. Significant sequence effects on solvation and ion localization were observed in these simulations. The results were compared to essentially all known experimental data on the subject. Proximity analysis was employed to highlight the sequence dependent differences in solvation and ion localization properties in the grooves of DNA. Comparison of the MD-calculated DNA structure with canonical A- and B-forms supports the idea that the G/C-rich sequences are closer to canonical A- than B-form structures, while the reverse is true for the poly A sequences, with the exception of the alternating ATAT sequence. Analysis of hydration density maps reveals that the flexibility of solute molecule has a significant effect on the nature of observed hydration. Energetic analysis of solute–solvent interactions based on proximity analysis of solvent reveals that the GC or CG base pairs interactmore strongly with watermolecules in the minor groove of DNA that the AT or TA base pairs, while the interactions of the AT or TA pairs in the major groove are stronger than those of the GC or CG pairs. Computation of solvent-accessible surface area of the nucleotide units in the simulated trajectories reveals that the similarity with results derived from analysis of a database of crystallographic structures is excellent. The MD trajectories tend to follow Manning’s counterion condensation theory, presenting a region of condensed counterions within a radius of about 17 Å from the DNA surface independent of sequence. The GC and CG pairs tend to associate with cations in the major groove of the DNA structure to a greater extent than the AT and TA pairs. Cation association is more frequent in the minor groove of AT than the GC pairs. In general, the observed water and ion atmosphere around the DNA sequences is the MD simulation is in good agreement with experimental observations.</p>

				<title>Characterization of structural and free energy properties of promoters associated with Primary and Operon TSS in <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> genome and their orthologs</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0423-0431</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Promoter regions in the genomes of all domains of life show similar trends in several structural properties such as stability, bendability, curvature, etc. In current study we analysed the stability and bendability of various classes of promoter regions (based on the recent identification of different classes of transcription start sites) of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> 26695 strain. It is found that primary TSS and operon-associated TSS promoters show significantly strong features in their promoter regions. DNA free-energy-based promoter prediction tool PromPredict was used to annotate promoters of different classes, and very high recall values (&#8764;80%) are obtained for primary TSS. Orthologous genes from other strains of <i>H. pylori</i> show conservation of structural properties in promoter regions as well as coding regions. PromPredict annotates promoters of orthologous genes with very high recall and precision.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present here a novel methodology for predicting new genes in prokaryotic genomes on the basis of inherent energetics of DNA. Regions of higher thermodynamic stability were identified, which were filtered based on already known annotations to yield a set of potentially new genes. These were then processed for their compatibility with the stereo-chemical properties of proteins and tripeptide frequencies of proteins in Swissprot data, which results in a reliable set of new genes in a genome. Quite surprisingly, the methodology identifies new genes even in well-annotated genomes. Also, the methodology can handle genomes of any GC-content, size and number of annotated genes.</p>

				<title>Effect of temperature on DNA double helix: An insight from molecular dynamics simulation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0445-0455</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The three-dimensional structure of DNA contains various sequence-dependent structural information, which control many cellular processes in life, such as replication, transcription, DNA repair, etc. For the above functions, DNA double helices need to unwind or melt locally, which is different from terminal melting, as often seen in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or even in many DNA crystal structures. We have carried out detailed MD simulations of DNA double helices of regular oligonucleotide fragments as well as in polymeric constructs with water and charge-neutralizing counter-ions at several different temperatures. We wanted to eliminate the end-effect or terminal melting propensity by employing MD simulation of DNA oligonucleotides in such a manner that gives rise to properties of polymeric DNA of infinite length. The polymeric construct is expected to allow us to see local melting at elevated temperatures. Comparative structural analysis of oligonucleotides and its corresponding virtual polymer at various temperatures ranging from 300 K to 400 K is discussed. The general behaviour, such as volume expansion coefficients of both the simulations show high similarity, indicating polymeric construct, does not give many artificial constraints. Local melting of a polymer, even at elevated temperature, may need a high nucleation energy that was not available in the short (7 ns) simulations. We expected to observe such nucleation followed by cooperative melting of the polymers in longer MD runs. Such simulations of different polymeric sequences would facilitate us to predict probable melting origins in a polymeric DNA.</p>

				<title>Interaction of nucleic acids with carbon nanotubes and dendrimers</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0457-0474</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nucleic acid interaction with nanoscale objects like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and dendrimers is of fundamental interest because of their potential application in CNT separation, gene therapy and antisense therapy. Combining nucleic acids with CNTs and dendrimers also opens the door towards controllable self-assembly to generate various supra-molecular and nano-structures with desired morphologies. The interaction between these nanoscale objects also serve as a model system for studying DNA compaction, which is a fundamental process in chromatin organization. By using fully atomistic simulations, here we report various aspects of the interactions and binding modes of DNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) with CNTs, graphene and dendrimers. Our results give a microscopic picture and mechanism of the adsorption of single- and double-strand DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA) on CNT and graphene. The nucleic acid–CNT interaction is dominated by the dispersive van der Waals (vdW) interaction. In contrast, the complexation of DNA (both ssDNA and dsDNA) and siRNA with various generations of poly-amido-amine (PAMAM) dendrimers is governed by electrostatic interactions. Our results reveal that both the DNA and siRNA form stable complex with the PAMAM dendrimer at a physiological pH when the dendrimer is positively charged due to the protonation of the primary amines. The size and binding energy of the complex increase with increase in dendrimer generation. We also give a summary of the current status in these fields and discuss future prospects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>One class of small molecules with therapeutic potential for treatment of cancer functions as transcription inhibitors via interaction with double-stranded DNA. Majority of the studies of the interaction with DNA have so far been reported under conditions nonexistent <i>in vivo</i>. Inside the cell, DNA is present in the nucleus as a complex with proteins known as chromatin. For the last few years we have been studying the interaction of these DNA-binding small molecules at the chromatin level with emphasis on the drug-induced structural alterations in chromatin. Our studies have shown that at the chromatin level these molecules could be classified in two broad categories: single-binding and dual-binding molecules. Single-binding molecules access only DNA in the chromatin, while the dual-binding molecules could bind to both DNA and the associated histone(s). Structural effects of the DNA-binding molecules upon chromatin in light of the above broad categories and the associated biological implications of the two types of binding are discussed.</p>

				<title>Prediction of DNA-binding specificity in zinc finger proteins</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0483-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc finger proteins interact via their individual fingers to three base pair subsites on the target DNA. The four key residue positions −1, 2, 3 and 6 on the alpha-helix of the zinc fingers have hydrogen bond interactions with the DNA. Mutating these key residues enables generation of a plethora of combinatorial possibilities that can bind to any DNA stretch of interest. Exploiting the binding specificity and affinity of the interaction between the zinc fingers and the respective DNA can help to generate engineered zinc fingers for therapeutic purposes involving genome targeting. Exploring the structure–function relationships of the existing zinc finger–DNA complexes can aid in predicting the probable zinc fingers that could bind to any target DNA. Computational tools ease the prediction of such engineered zinc fingers by effectively utilizing information from the available experimental data. A study of literature reveals many approaches for predicting DNA-binding specificity in zinc finger proteins. However, an alternative approach that looks into the physico-chemical properties of these complexes would do away with the difficulties of designing unbiased zinc fingers with the desired affinity and specificity. We present a physico-chemical approach that exploits the relative strengths of hydrogen bonding between the target DNA and all combinatorially possible zinc fingers to select the most optimum zinc finger protein candidate.</p>

				<title>Inhibition of HIV-1 Integrase gene expression by 10-23 DNAzyme</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0493-0502</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>HIV Integrase (IN) is an enzyme that is responsible for the integration of the proviral genome into the human genome, and this integration step is the first step of the virus hijacking the human cell machinery for its propagation and replication. 10-23 DNAzyme has the potential to suppress gene expressions through sequence-specific mRNA cleavage. We have designed three novel DNAzymes, DIN54, DIN116, and DIN152, against HIV-1 Integrase gene using Mfold software and evaluated them for target site cleavage activity on the in vitro transcribed mRNA. All DNAzymes were tested for its inhibition of expression of HIV Integrase protein in the transiently transfected cell lines. DIN116 and DIN152 inhibited IN-EGFP expression by 80% and 70% respectively.</p>

				<title>DNA damage by reactive species: Mechanisms, mutation and repair</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0503-0517</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DNA is continuously attacked by reactive species that can affect its structure and function severely. Structural modifications to DNA mainly arise from modifications in its bases that primarily occur due to their exposure to different reactive species. Apart from this, DNA strand break, inter- and intra-strand crosslinks and DNA–protein crosslinks can also affect the structure of DNA significantly. These structural modifications are involved in mutation, cancer and many other diseases. As it has the least oxidation potential among all the DNA bases, guanine is frequently attacked by reactive species, producing a plethora of lethal lesions. Fortunately, living cells are evolved with intelligent enzymes that continuously protect DNA from such damages. This review provides an overview of different guanine lesions formed due to reactions of guanine with different reactive species. Involvement of these lesions in inter- and intra-strand crosslinks, DNA–protein crosslinks and mutagenesis are discussed. How certain enzymes recognize and repair different guanine lesions in DNA are also presented.</p>

				<title>DNA triplex structures in neurodegenerative disorder, Friedreich's ataxia</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0519-0532</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is now established that a small fraction of genomic DNA does adopt the non-canonical B-DNA structure or ‘unusual’ DNA structure. The unusual DNA structures like DNA-hairpin, cruciform, Z-DNA, triplex and tetraplex are represented as hotspots of chromosomal breaks, homologous recombination and gross chromosomal rearrangements since they are prone to the structural alterations. Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), the autosomal recessive degenerative disorder of nervous and muscles tissue, is caused by the massive expansion of (GAA) repeats that occur in the first intron of Frataxin gene X25 on chromosome 9q13-q21.1. The purine strand of the DNA in the expanded (GAA) repeat region folds back to form the (R∙R<sup>*</sup>Y) type of triplex, which further inhibits the frataxin gene expression, and this clearly suggests that the shape of DNA is the determining factor in the cellular function. FRDA is the only disease known so far to be associated with DNA triplex. Structural characterization of GAA-containing DNA triplexes using some simple biophysical methods like UV melting, UV absorption, circular dichroic spectroscopy and electrophoretic mobility shift assay are discussed. Further, the clinical aspects and genetic analysis of FRDA patients who carry (GAA) repeat expansions are presented. The potential of some small molecules that do not favour the DNA triplex formation as therapeutics for FRDA are also briefly discussed.</p>

				<page>0533-0538</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The energy landscape of RNA is known to be extremely rugged, and hence finding low-energy structures starting from a random structure is a challenging task for any optimization algorithm. In the current work, we have investigated the ability of one Monte Carlo–based optimization algorithm, Temperature Basin Paving, to explore the energy landscape of a small RNA T-loop hairpin. In this method, the history of the simulation is used to increase the probability of states less visited in the simulation. It has been found that using both energy and end-to-end distance as the biasing parameters in the simulation, the partially folded structure of the hairpin starting from random structures could be obtained.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Studies on RNA targeting by small molecules to specifically control certain cellular functions is an area of remarkable current interest. For this purpose, a basic understanding of the molecular aspects of the interaction of small molecules with various RNA structures is essential. Alkaloids are a group of natural products with potential therapeutic utility, and very recently, their interaction with many RNA structures have been reported. Especially noteworthy are the protoberberines and aristolochia alkaloids distributed widely in many botanical families. Many of the alkaloids of these group exhibit excellent binding affinity to many RNA structures that may be exploited to develop RNA targeted therapeutics. This review attempts to present the current status on the understanding of the interaction of these alkaloids with various RNA structures, mainly highlighting the biophysical aspects.</p>

				<title>Structural studies on ligand–DNA systems: A robust approach in drug design</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0553-0561</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular docking, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics and relaxation matrix simulation protocols have been extensively used to generate the structural details of ligand–receptor complexes in order to understand the binding interactions between the two entities. Experimental methods like NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography are known to provide structural information about ligand–receptor complexes. In addition, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and molecular docking have also been utilized to decode the phenomenon of the ligand–DNA interactions, with good correlation between experimental and computational results. The DNA binding affinity was demonstrated by analysing fluorescence spectral data. Structural rigidity of DNA upon ligand binding was identified by CD spectroscopy. Docking is carried out using the DNA-Dock program which results in the binding affinity data along with structural information like interatomic distances and H-bonding, etc. The complete structural analyses of various drug–DNA complexes have afforded results that indicate a specific DNA binding pattern of these ligands. It also exhibited that certain structural features of ligands can make a ligand to be AT- or GC-specific. It was also demonstrated that changing specificity from AT base pairs to GC base pairs further improved the DNA topoisomerase inhibiting activity in certain ligands. Thus, a specific molecular recognition signature encrypted in the structure of ligand can be decoded and can be effectively employed in designing more potent antiviral and antitumour agents.</p>

				<title><i>In silico</i> study of interaction between rice proteins enhanced disease susceptibility 1 and phytoalexin deficient 4, the regulators of salicylic acid signalling pathway</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0563-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1), a plant-specific protein has homology with the eukaryotic lipase in their N-terminal halves and a unique domain at its C-termini. EDS1 is known to be an important regulator of biotic stress and an essential component of basal immunity. EDS1 interacts with its positive co-regulator phytoalexin deficient 4 (PAD4), resulting in mobilization of the salicylic acid defence pathway. Limited information regarding this interaction in rice is available. To study this interaction, a model of EDS1 and PAD4 proteins from rice was generated and validated with Accelrys DS software version 3.1 using bioinformatics interface. The in silico docking between the two proteins showed a significant protein–protein interaction between rice EDS1 and PAD4, suggesting that they form a dimeric protein complex, which, similar to that in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, is perhaps also important for triggering the salicylic acid signalling pathway in plants.</p>

				<title>A possible molecular metric for biological evolvability</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0573-0577</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Proteins manifest themselves as phenotypic traits, retained or lost in living systems via evolutionary pressures. Simply put, survival is essentially the ability of a living system to synthesize a functional protein that allows for a response to environmental perturbations (adaptation). Loss of functional proteins leads to extinction. Currently there are no universally applicable quantitative metrics at the molecular level for either measuring ‘evolvability’ of life or for assessing the conditions under which a living system would go extinct and why. In this work, we show emergence of the first such metric by utilizing the recently discovered stoichiometric margin of life for all known naturally occurring (and functional) proteins. The constraint of having well-defined stoichiometries of the 20 amino acids in naturally occurring protein sequences requires utilization of the full scope of degeneracy in the genetic code, i.e. usage of all codons coding for an amino acid, by only 11 of the 20 amino acids. This shows that the non-availability of individual codons for these 11 amino acids would disturb the fine stoichiometric balance resulting in non-functional proteins and hence extinction. Remarkably, these amino acids are found in close proximity of any given amino acid in the backbones of thousands of known crystal structures of folded proteins. On the other hand, stoichiometry of the remaining 9 amino acids, found to be farther/distal from any given amino acid in backbones of folded proteins, is maintained independent of the number of codons available to synthesize them, thereby providing some robustness and hence survivability.</p>

				<title>Making sense of ocean biota: How evolution and biodiversity of land organisms differ from that of the plankton</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0589-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oceans cover 70% of the planet’s surface, and their planktonic inhabitants generate about half the global primary production, thereby playing a key role in modulating planetary climate via the carbon cycle. The ocean biota have been under scientific scrutiny for well over a century, and yet our understanding of the processes driving natural selection in the pelagic environment – the open water inhabited by drifting plankton and free-swimming nekton – is still quite vague. Because of the fundamental differences in the physical environment, pelagic ecosystems function differently from the familiar terrestrial ecosystems of which we are a part. Natural selection creates biodiversity but understanding how this quality control of randommutations operates in the oceans − which traits are selected for under what circumstances and by which environmental factors, whether bottom-up or top-down − is currently a major challenge. Rapid advances in genomics are providing information, particularly in the prokaryotic realm, pertaining not only to the biodiversity inventory but also functional groups. This essay is dedicated to the poorly understood tribes of planktonic protists (unicellular eukaryotes) that feed the ocean’s animals and continue to run the elemental cycles of our planet. It is an attempt at developing a conceptually coherent framework to understand the course of evolution by natural selection in the plankton and contrast it with the better-known terrestrial realm. I argue that organism interactions, in particular co-evolution between predators and prey (the arms race), play a central role in driving evolution in the pelagic realm. Understanding the evolutionary forces shaping ocean biota is a prerequisite for harnessing plankton for human purposes and also for protecting the oceanic ecosystems currently under severe stress from anthropogenic pressures.</p>

					<p>We rely on the helicoidal Peyrard-Bishop model for DNA dynamics. Interaction between nucleotides at a same site belonging to different strands is modelled by a Morse potential energy. This potential depends on two parameters that are different for AT and CG pairs, which is a possible source for inhomogeneity. It was shown recently (Zdravković and Satarić 2011) that certain values of these parameters bring about a negligible influence of inhomogeneity on the solitonic dynamics. We propose an experiment that should be carried out in order to determine the values of both of these parameters.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0617-0633</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Vitreoscilla</i> haemoglobin (VHb) expression in heterologous host was shown to enhance growth and oxygen utilization capabilities under oxygen-limited conditions. The exact mechanism by which VHb enhances the oxygen utilization under oxygen-limiting conditions is still unknown. In order to understand the role of VHb in promoting oxygen utilization, changes in the total protein profile of <i>E. coli</i> expressing the vgb gene under its native promoter was analysed. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) was employed to quantify the differentially expressed proteins under oxygen-limiting conditions. Overexpression of proteins involved in aerobic metabolic pathways and suppression of proteins involved in non-oxidative metabolic pathways shown in this study indicates that the cells expressing VHb prefer aerobic metabolic pathways even under oxygen limitation. Under these conditions, the expression levels of proteins involved in central metabolic pathways, cellular adaptation and cell division were also found to be altered. These results imply that <i>Vitreoscilla</i> haemoglobin expression alters aerobic metabolism specifically, in addition to altering proteins involved in other pathways, the significance of which is not clear as of now.</p>

				<title>Changes in membrane lipids and carotenoids during light acclimation in a marine cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus</i> sp.</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0635-0645</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time course of carotenoid and membrane lipid variation during high light (HL) acclimation (about 85 𝜇mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), after transfer from low light (LL) (5–10 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), was determined in a marine Synechococcus strain. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to diode array detector (DAD) or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used for compound separation and detection. Myxoxanthophyll rose within a time interval of 8 h to 24 h after the onset of exposure to HL. 𝛽-carotene content started to decrease after 4 h of the onset of exposure to HL. Zeaxanthin content rose with exposure to HL, but it was only significant after 24 h of exposure. Carotenoid changes are in agreement with a coordinated activity of the enzymes of the myxoxanthophyll biosynthetic pathway, with no rate-limiting intermediate steps. Lipid analysis showed all species with a C18:3/C16:0 composition increased their content, the changes of PG(18:3/16:0) and MGDG(18:3/16:0) being primarily significant. Major lipid changes were also found to occur within 24 h. These changes might suggest reduction and reorganization of the thylakoid membrane structure. Hypotheses are also drawn on the role played by lipid molecule shape and their possible effect in membrane fluidity and protein accommodation.</p>

				<title>Molecular analysis of gut microbiota in obesity among Indian individuals</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0647-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Obesity is a consequence of a complex interplay between the host genome and the prevalent obesogenic factors among the modern communities. The role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of the disorder was recently discovered; however, 16S-rRNA-based surveys revealed compelling but community-specific data. Considering this, despite unique diets, dietary habits and an uprising trend in obesity, the Indian counterparts are poorly studied. Here, we report a comparative analysis and quantification of dominant gut microbiota of lean, normal, obese and surgically treated obese individuals of Indian origin. Representative gut microbial diversity was assessed by sequencing fecal 16S rRNA libraries for each group (n=5) with a total of over 3000 sequences. We detected no evident trend in the distribution of the predominant bacterial phyla, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. At the genus level, the bacteria of genus <i>Bacteroides</i> were prominent among the obese individuals, which was further confirmed by qPCR (𝑃 &#62; 0.05). In addition, a remarkably high archaeal density with elevated fecal SCFA levels was also noted in the obese group. On the contrary, the treated-obese individuals exhibited comparatively reduced <i>Bacteroides</i> and archaeal counts along with reduced fecal SCFAs. In conclusion, the study successfully identified a representative microbial diversity in the Indian subjects and demonstrated the prominence of certain bacterial groups in obese individuals; nevertheless, further studies are essential to understand their role in obesity.</p>

				<title>The hnRNP A1 homolog Hrp36 is essential for normal development, female fecundity, omega speckle formation and stress tolerance in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0659-0678</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hrp36/Hrb87F is one of the most abundant and well-characterized hnRNP A homolog in <i>Drosophila</i> and is shown to have roles in regulation of alternative splicing, heterochromatin formation, neurodegeneration, etc. Yet, <i>hrp36</i> null individuals were reported to be viable and without any apparent phenotype, presumably because of overlapping functions provided by Hrp38 and related proteins. Here we show that loss of both copies of <i>hrp36</i> gene slows down development with significant reduction in adult life span, decreased female fecundity and high sensitivity to starvation and thermal stresses. In the absence of Hrp36, the nucleoplasmic omega speckles are nearly completely disrupted. The levels of nuclear matrix protein Megator and the chromatin remodeller ISWI are significantly elevated in principal cells of larval Malpighian tubules, which also display additional endoreplication cycles and good polytene chromosomes. We suggest that besides the non-coding hsr𝜔-n transcripts, the Hrp36 protein is also a core constituent of omega speckles. The heat-shock-induced association of other hnRNPs at the <i>hsr</i>𝜔 locus is affected in <i>hrp36</i> null cells, which may be one of the reasons for their high sensitivity to cell stress. Therefore, in spite of the functional redundancy provided by Hrp38, Hrp36 is essential for normal development and for survival under conditions of stress.</p>

				<title>Effect of chronic exposure to aspartame on oxidative stress in the brain of albino rats</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0679-0688</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study was aimed at investigating the chronic effect of the artificial sweetener aspartame on oxidative stress in brain regions of Wistar strain albino rats. Many controversial reports are available on the use of aspartame as it releases methanol as one of its metabolite during metabolism. The present study proposed to investigate whether chronic aspartame (75 mg/kg) administration could release methanol and induce oxidative stress in the rat brain. To mimic the human methanol metabolism, methotrexate (MTX)-treated rats were included to study the aspartame effects. Wistar strain male albino rats were administered with aspartame orally and studied along with controls and MTX-treated controls. The blood methanol level was estimated, the animal was sacrificed and the free radical changes were observed in brain discrete regions by assessing the scavenging enzymes, reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein thiol levels. It was observed that there was a significant increase in LPO levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, GPx levels and CAT activity with a significant decrease in GSH and protein thiol. Moreover, the increases in some of these enzymes were region specific. Chronic exposure of aspartame resulted in detectable methanol in blood. Methanol per se and its metabolites may be responsible for the generation of oxidative stress in brain regions.</p>

				<title>The present Pyrenean population of bearded vulture (<i>Gypaetus barbatus</i>): Its genetic characteristics</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0689-0694</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Pyrenean population of the endangered bearded vulture (<i>Gypaetus barbatus</i>) is the largest natural population in Europe. In this study, its current genetic variability was assessed using 110 animals of the recent population in order to know what the present situation. Sex identification by DNA methodology in the 110 bearded vultures, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and eight microsatellite markers in 87 bearded vultures have been analysed. Our results for sex identification present a number of 49 males and 61 females; no significant differences for number of males and females in this population have been observed. mtDNA studies indicate that nucleotide and haplotype diversities and number of variable sites were low. Tajima’s D test and Fu and Li’s D<sup>*</sup> and F<sup>*</sup> tests suggest that mutations are selectively neutral and the population is expanding. A mean number of alleles per locus and a mean observed heterozygosity have been obtained by microsatellite analysis. F<sub>IS</sub> is not high, and inbreeding depression could be discarded in the near future. The results suggest that the Pyrenean population of bearded vultures have to be controlled in order to avoid the loss of genetic variability. This data should be taken into account when considering conservation plans for the species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic epichlorohydrin for the production of enantiopure (𝑆)-epichloro-hydrin using whole cells of <i>Aspergillus niger</i> ZJB-09173 in organic solvents was investigated. Cyclohexane was used as the reaction medium based on the excellent enantioselectivity of epoxide hydrolase from <i>A. niger</i> ZJB-09173 in cyclohexane. However, cyclohexane had a negative effect on the stability of epoxide hydrolase from <i>A. niger</i> ZJB-09173. In the cyclohexane medium, substrate inhibition, rather than product inhibition of catalysis, was observed in the hydrolysis of racemic epichlorohydrin using <i>A. niger</i> ZJB-09173. The racemic epichlorohydrin concentration was markedly increased by continuous feeding of substrate without significant decline of the yield. Ultimately, 18.5% of (𝑆)-epichlorohydrin with 98% enantiomeric excess from 153.6 mM of racemic epichlorohydrin was obtained by the dry cells of <i>A. niger</i> ZJB-09173, which was the highest substrate concentration in the production of enantiopure (𝑆)-epichlorohydrin by epoxide hydrolases using an organic solvent medium among the known reports.</p>

				<title>Oxyradicals and PSII activity in maize leaves in the absence of UV components of solar spectrum</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0703-0712</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The regulation of oxyradicals and PSII activity by UV-B (280–315 nm) and UV-A (315–400 nm) components were investigated in the leaves of maize [Zea mays L. var: HQPM.1]. The impact of ambient UV radiation on the production of superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>˙<sup>−</sup>) and hydroxyl (˙OH) radicals were analysed in the leaves of 20-day-old plants. The amount of O<sub>2</sub>˙<sup>−</sup> and ˙OH radicals and the radical scavenging activity were significantly higher in the leaves exposed to ambient UV radiation as compared to the leaves of the plants grown under UV exclusion filters. Smaller amount of oxyradicals in the leaves of UV excluded plants was accompanied by a substantial increase in quantum yield of electron transport (𝜑Eo), rate of electron transport (𝜓o) and performance index (PI<sub>ABS</sub>), as indicated by chlorophyll 𝑎 fluorescence transient. Although higher amounts of oxyradicals invoked higher activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and peroxidase under ambient UV, they also imposed limitation on the photosynthetic efficiency of PSII. Exclusion of UV components (UV-B 280–315 nm; UV-A 315–400 nm) translated to enhanced photosynthesis, growth and biomass. Thus, solar UV components, especially in the tropical region, could be a major limiting factor in the photosynthetic efficiency of the crop plants.</p>

				<title>Ion distribution measured by electron probe X-ray microanalysis in apoplastic and symplastic pathways in root cells in sunflower plants grown in saline medium</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0713-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Little is known about how salinity affects ions distribution in root apoplast and symplast. Using x-ray microanalysis, ions distribution and the relative contribution of apoplastic and symplastic pathways for delivery of ions to root xylem were studied in sunflower plants exposed to moderate salinity (EC=6). Cortical cells provided a considerably extended Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> storage facility. Their contents are greater in cytoplasm (root symplast) as compared to those in intercellular spaces (root apoplast). Hence, in this level of salinity, salt damage in sunflower is not dehydration due to extracellular accumulation of sodium and chloride ions, as suggested in the Oertli hypothesis. On the other hand, reduction in calcium content due to salinity in intercellular space is less than reduction in the cytoplasm of cortical cells. It seems that sodium inhibits the radial movement of calcium in symplastic pathway more than in the apoplastic pathway. The cell wall seems to have an important role in providing calcium for the apoplastic pathway. Redistribution of calcium from the cell wall to intercellular space is because of its tendency towards xylem through the apoplastic pathway. This might be a strategy to enhance loading of calcium to xylem elements and to reduce calcium deficiency in young leaves under salinity. This phenomenon may be able to increase salt tolerance in sunflower plants. Supplemental calcium has been found to be effective in reducing radial transport of Na<sup>+</sup> across the root cells and their loading into the xylem, but not sodium absorption. Supplemental calcium enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and influx into roots and transport to stele.</p>

				<title>Simple luminosity normalization of greenness, yellowness and redness/greenness for comparison of leaf spectral profiles in multi-temporally acquired remote sensing images</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0723-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Observation of leaf colour (spectral profiles) through remote sensing is an effective method of identifying the spatial distribution patterns of abnormalities in leaf colour, which enables appropriate plant management measures to be taken. However, because the brightness of remote sensing images varies with acquisition time, in the observation of leaf spectral profiles in multi-temporally acquired remote sensing images, changes in brightness must be taken into account. This study identified a simple luminosity normalization technique that enables leaf colours to be compared in remote sensing images over time. The intensity values of green and yellow (green+red) exhibited strong linear relationships with luminosity (R<sup>2</sup> &#62; 0.926) when various invariant rooftops in Bangkok or Tokyo were spectral-profiled using remote sensing images acquired at different time points. The values of the coefficient and constant or the coefficient of the formulae describing the intensity of green or yellow were comparable among the single Bangkok site and the two Tokyo sites, indicating the technique’s general applicability. For single rooftops, the values of the coefficient of variation for green, yellow, and red/green were 16% or less (n=6−11), indicating an accuracy not less than those of well-established remote sensing measures such as the normalized difference vegetation index. After obtaining the above linear relationships, raw intensity values were normalized and a temporal comparison of the spectral profiles of the canopies of evergreen and deciduous tree species in Tokyo was made to highlight the changes in the canopies’ spectral profiles. Future aspects of this technique are discussed herein.</p>

				<title>Transcriptome response to nitrogen starvation in rice</title>

				<page>0731-0747</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nitrogen is an essential mineral nutrient required for plant growth and development. Insufficient nitrogen (N) supply triggers extensive physiological and biochemical changes in plants. In this study, we used Affymetrix GeneChip rice genome arrays to analyse the dynamics of rice transcriptome under N starvation. N starvation induced or suppressed transcription of 3518 genes, representing 10.88% of the genome. These changes, mostly transient, affected various cellular metabolic pathways, including stress response, primary and secondary metabolism, molecular transport, regulatory process and organismal development. 462 or 13.1% transcripts for N starvation expressed similarly in root and shoot. Comparative analysis between rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i> identified 73 orthologous groups that responded to N starvation, demonstrated the existence of conserved N stress coupling mechanism among plants. Additional analysis of transcription profiles of microRNAs revealed differential expression of miR399 and miR530 under N starvation, suggesting their potential roles in plant nutrient homeostasis.</p>

				<title>Metabolic response to exogenous ethanol in yeast: An <i>in vivo</i> statistical total correlation NMR spectroscopy approach</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0749-0755</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>In vivo</i> NMR spectroscopy, together with selectively 13C-labelled substrates and ‘statistical total correlation spectroscopy’ analysis (STOCSY), are valuable tools to collect and interpret the metabolic responses of a living organism to external stimuli. In this study, we applied this approach to evaluate the effects of increasing concentration of exogenous ethanol on the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> fermentative metabolism. We show that the STOCSY analysis correctly identifies the different types of correlations among the enriched metabolites involved in the fermentation, and that these correlations are quite stable even in presence of a stressing factor such as the exogenous ethanol.</p>

				<title>Molecular characterization of `Bhut Jolokia' the hottest chilli</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0757-0768</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The northeast region of India, considered as ‘hot spot’ of biodiversity, having unique ecological environment with hot and high-humidity conditions, has given rise to the world’s hottest chilli, ‘Bhut Jolokia’, which is at least two times hotter than Red Savina Habanero in terms of Scoville heat units (SHU). This study was undertaken to determine the distinctiveness of ‘Bhut Jolokia’ from <i>Capsicum frutescens</i> or <i>Capsicum chinense</i> through sequencing of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-internal transcribed (ITS) region along with its phylogenetic analysis. Although a compensatory base change (CBC) in the ITS2 region was not observed between the closely related species of <i>C. frutescens</i> and <i>C. chinense</i> when compared with <i>Bhut Jolokia</i>; phylogenetic analysis using ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 sequences indicated a distinct clade for all the accessions of ‘Bhut Joloikia’, while <i>C. frutescens</i> and <i>C. chinense</i> occupied discrete lineages. Further, a unique 13-base deletion was observed in all the representative accessions of ‘Bhut Jolokia’, making it distinct from all other members within the genus and beyond. The degree of genetic variations along with its extreme pungency might be related to ambient environmental factors of northeastern India.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Cocos sahnii Kaul</i>, a fossil palm fruit, is validated and described from the Fuller’s earth deposits of Kapurdi village of Rajasthan considered as Early Eocene in age. The fossil best resembles the genus <i>Cocos</i>, particularly <i>Cocos nucifera</i> L., which is now a common coastal element thriving in highly moist conditions. The recovery of this coconut-like fruit, along with earlier described evergreen taxa from the same formation, suggests the existence of typical tropical, warm and humid coastal conditions during the depositional period. The present arid to semi-arid climatic conditions occurring in Rajasthan indicate drastic climate change in the region during the Cenozoic. The possible time for the onset of aridity in the region which caused the total eradication of semi-evergreen to evergreen forests is discussed, as well as the palaeobiogeography of coconuts.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We empirically applied the GrooFiWorld agent-based model (Puga-González <i>et al.</i> 2009) in a group of captive red-capped mangabeys (<i>Cercocebus torquatus</i>). We analysed several measurements related to aggression and affiliative patterns. The group adopted a combination of despotic and egalitarian behaviours resulting from the behavioural flexibility observed in the Cercopithecinae subfamily. Our study also demonstrates that the GrooFiWorld agent-based model can be extended to other members of the Cercopithecinae subfamily generating parsimonious hypotheses related to the social organization.</p>

				<title>BIND – An algorithm for loss-less compression of nucleotide sequence data</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0785-0789</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the current generation of life science researchers to probe deeper into the genomic blueprint. The amount of data generated by these technologies has been increasing exponentially since the last decade. Storage, archival and dissemination of such huge data sets require efficient solutions, both from the hardware as well as software perspective. The present paper describes BIND – an algorithm specialized for compressing nucleotide sequence data. By adopting a unique ‘block-length’ encoding for representing binary data (as a key step), BIND achieves significant compression gains as compared to the widely used general purpose compression algorithms (gzip, bzip2 and lzma). Moreover, in contrast to implementations of existing specialized genomic compression approaches, the implementation of BIND is enabled to handle non-ATGC and lowercase characters. This makes BIND a loss-less compression approach that is suitable for practical use. More importantly, validation results of BIND (with real-world data sets) indicate reasonable speeds of compression and decompression that can be achieved with minimal processor/memory usage. BIND is available for download at <i>http://metagenomics.atc.tcs.com/compression/BIND</i>. No license is required for academic or non-profit use.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Begomoviruses are a large group of whitefly-transmitted plant viruses containing single-stranded circular DNA encapsidated in geminate particles. They are responsible for significant yield losses in a wide variety of crops in India. Research on begomoviruses has focussed on the molecular characterization of the viruses, their phylogenetic analyses, infectivities on host plants, DNA replication, transgenic resistance, promoter analysis and development of virus-based gene silencing vectors. There have been a number of reports of satellite molecules associated with begomoviruses. This article aims to summarize the major developments in begomoviral research in India in the last approximately 15 years and identifies future areas that need more attention.</p>

				<title>Advances in genetics and molecular breeding of three legume crops of semi-arid tropics using next-generation sequencing and high-throughput genotyping technologies</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0811-0820</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular markers are the most powerful genomic tools to increase the efficiency and precision of breeding practices for crop improvement. Progress in the development of genomic resources in the leading legume crops of the semi-arid tropics (SAT), namely, chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), pigeonpea (<i>Cajanus cajan</i>) and groundnut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>), as compared to other crop species like cereals, has been very slow. With the advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and high-throughput (HTP) genotyping methods, there is a shift in development of genomic resources including molecular markers in these crops. For instance, 2,000 to 3,000 novel simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers have been developed each for chickpea, pigeonpea and groundnut. Based on Sanger, 454/FLX and Illumina transcript reads, transcriptome assemblies have been developed for chickpea (44,845 transcript assembly contigs, or TACs) and pigeonpea (21,434 TACs). Illumina sequencing of some parental genotypes of mapping populations has resulted in the development of 120 million reads for chickpea and 128.9 million reads for pigeonpea. Alignment of these Illumina reads with respective transcriptome assemblies have provided &#62; 10,000 SNPs each in chickpea and pigeonpea. A variety of SNP genotyping platforms including GoldenGate, VeraCode and Competitive Allele Specific PCR (KASPar) assays have been developed in chickpea and pigeonpea. By using above resources, the first-generation or comprehensive genetic maps have been developed in the three legume speciesmentioned above. Analysis of phenotyping data together with genotyping data has provided candidate markers for drought-tolerance-related root traits in chickpea, resistance to foliar diseases in groundnut and sterility mosaic disease (SMD) and fertility restoration in pigeonpea. Together with these trait-associated markers along with those already available, molecular breeding programmes have been initiated for enhancing drought tolerance, resistance to fusarium wilt and ascochyta blight in chickpea and resistance to foliar diseases in groundnut. These trait-associated robust markers along with other genomic resources including genetic maps and genomic resources will certainly accelerate crop improvement programmes in the SAT legumes.</p>

				<title>Large SNP arrays for genotyping in crop plants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0821-0828</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genotyping with large numbers of molecular markers is now an indispensable tool within plant genetics and breeding. Especially through the identification of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using the novel high-throughput sequencing technologies, it is now possible to reliably identify many thousands of SNPs at many different loci in a given plant genome. For a number of important crop plants, SNP markers are now being used to design genotyping arrays containing thousands of markers spread over the entire genome and to analyse large numbers of samples. In this article, we discuss aspects that should be considered during the design of such large genotyping arrays and the analysis of individuals. The fact that crop plants are also often autopolyploid or allopolyploid is given due consideration. Furthermore, we outline some potential applications of large genotyping arrays including high-density genetic mapping, characterization (fingerprinting) of genetic material and breeding-related aspects such as association studies and genomic selection.</p>

				<title>Application of large-scale sequencing to marker discovery in plants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0829-0841</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Advances in DNA sequencing provide tools for efficient large-scale discovery of markers for use in plants. Discovery options include large-scale amplicon sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, gene-enriched genome sequencing and whole genome sequencing. Examples of each of these approaches and their potential to generate molecular markers for specific applications have been described. Sequencing the whole genome of parents identifies all the poly-morphisms available for analysis in their progeny. Sequencing PCR amplicons of sets of candidate genes from DNA bulks can be used to define the available variation in these genes that might be exploited in a population or germplasm collection. Sequencing of the transcriptomes of genotypes varying for the trait of interest may identify genes with patterns of expression that could explain the phenotypic variation. Sequencing genomic DNA enriched for genes by hybridization with probes for all or some of the known genes simplifies sequencing and analysis of differences in gene sequences between large numbers of genotypes and genes especially when working with complex genomes. Examples of application of the above-mentioned techniques have been described.</p>

				<title>Diversity in global maize germplasm: Characterization and utilization</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0843-0855</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) is not only of worldwide importance as a food, feed and as a source of diverse industrially important products, but is also a model genetic organism with immense genetic diversity. Although it was first domesticated in Mexico, maize landraces are widely found across the continents. Several studies in Mexico and other countries highlighted the genetic variability in the maize germplasm. Applications of molecular markers, particularly in the last two decades, have led to new insights into the patterns of genetic diversity in maize globally, including landraces as well as wild relatives (especially teosintes) in Latin America, helping in tracking the migration routes of maize from the centers of origin, and understanding the fate of genetic diversity during maize domestication. The genome sequencing of B73 (a highly popular US Corn Belt inbred) and Palomero (a popcorn landrace in Mexico) in the recent years are important landmarks in maize research, with significant implications to our understanding of the maize genome organization and evolution. Next-generation sequencing and high-throughput genotyping platforms promise to further revolutionize our understanding of genetic diversity and for designing strategies to utilize the genomic information for maize improvement. However, the major limiting factor to exploit the genetic diversity in crops like maize is no longer genotyping, but high-throughput and precision phenotyping. There is an urgent need to establish a global phenotyping network for comprehensive and efficient characterization of maize germplasm for an array of target traits, particularly for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and nutritional quality. ‘Seeds of Discovery’ (SeeD), a novel initiative by CIMMYT with financial support from the Mexican Government for generating international public goods, has initiated intensive exploration of phenotypic and molecular diversity of maize germplasm conserved in the CIMMYT Gene Bank; this is expected to aid in effective identification and use of novel alleles and haplotypes for maize improvement. Multi-institutional efforts are required at the global level to systematically explore the maize germplasm to diversify the genetic base of elite breeding materials, create novel varieties and counter the effects of global climate changes.</p>

				<title>Divergence of flowering genes in soybean</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0857-0870</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soybean genome sequences were blasted with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> regulatory genes involved in photoperiod-dependent flowering. This approach enabled the identification of 118 genes involved in the flowering pathway. Two genome sequences of cultivated (Williams 82) and wild (IT182932) soybeans were employed to survey functional DNA variations in the flowering-related homologs. Forty genes exhibiting nonsynonymous substitutions between <i>G. max</i> and <i>G. soja</i> were catalogued. In addition, 22 genes were found to co-localize with QTLs for six traits including flowering time, first flower, pod maturity, beginning of pod, reproductive period, and seed filling period. Among the genes overlapping the QTL regions, two <i>LHY/CCA1</i> genes, <i>GI</i> and <i>SFR6</i> contained amino acid changes. The recently duplicated sequence regions of the soybean genome were used as additional criteria for the speculation of the putative function of the homologs. Two duplicated regions showed redundancy of both flowering-related genes and QTLs. ID 12398025, which contains the homeologous regions between chr 7 and chr 16, was redundant for the <i>LHY/CCA1</i> and <i>SPA1</i> homologs and the QTLs. Retaining of the <i>CRY1</i> gene and the pod maturity QTLs were observed in the duplicated region of ID 23546507 on chr 4 and chr 6. Functional DNA variation of the <i>LHY/CCA1</i> gene (Glyma07g05410) was present in a counterpart of the duplicated region on chr 7, while the gene (Glyma16g01980) present in the other portion of the duplicated region on chr 16 did not show a functional sequence change. The gene list catalogued in this study provides primary insight for understanding the regulation of flowering time and maturity in soybean.</p>

				<title>Molecular markers in management of <i>ex situ</i> PGR - A case study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0871-0877</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Worldwide germplasm collections contain about 7.4 million accessions of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. One of the 10 largest <i>ex situ</i> genebanks of our globe is located at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research in Gatersleben, Germany. Molecular tools have been used for various gene bank management practices including characterization and utilization of the germplasm. The results on genetic integrity of longterm-stored gene bank accessions of wheat (self-pollinating) and rye (open-pollinating) cereal crops revealed a high degree of identity for wheat. In contrast, the out-pollinating accessions of rye exhibited shifts in allele frequencies. The genetic diversity of wheat and barley germplasm collected at intervals of 40 to 50 years in comparable geographical regions showed qualitative rather than a quantitative change in diversity. The inter- and intraspecific variation of seed longevity was analysed and differences were detected. Genetic studies in barley, wheat and oilseed rape revealed numerous QTL, indicating the complex and quantitative nature of seed longevity. Some of the loci identified were in genomic regions that co-localize with genes determining agronomic traits such as spike architecture or biotic and abiotic stress response. Finally, a genome-wide association mapping analysis of a core collection of wheat for flowering time was performed using diversity array technology (DArT) markers. Maker trait associations were detected in genomic regions where major genes or QTL have been described earlier. In addition, new loci were also detected, providing opportunities to monitor genetic variation for crop improvement.</p>

				<title>Genetic mapping and coccidial parasites: past achievements and future prospects</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0879-0886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coccidial parasites including <i>Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii</i> and the <i>Eimeria</i> species can cause severe disease of medical and veterinary importance. As many as one-third of the human population may carry <i>T. gondii</i> infection, and <i>Eimeria</i> are thought to cost the global poultry production industry in excess of US$2 billion per annum. Despite their significance, effective vaccines are scarce and have been confined to the veterinary field. As sequencing and genotyping technologies continue to develop, genetic mapping remains a valuable tool for the identification of genes that underlie phenotypic traits of interest and the assembly of contiguous genome sequences. For the coccidian, cross-fertilization still requires <i>in vivo</i> infection, a feature of their life cycle which limits the use of genetic mapping strategies. Importantly, the development of population-based approaches has now removed the need to isolate clonal lines for genetic mapping of selectable traits, complementing the classical clone-based techniques. To date, four coccidial species, representing three genera, have been investigated using genetic mapping. In this review we will discuss recent progress with these species and examine the prospects for future initiatives.</p>

				<title>Molecular-based rapid inventories of sympatric diversity: A comparison of DNA barcode clustering methods applied to geography-based vs clade-based sampling of amphibians</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0887-0896</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular markers offer a universal source of data for quantifying biodiversity. DNA barcoding uses a standardized genetic marker and a curated reference database to identify known species and to reveal cryptic diversity within well-sampled clades. Rapid biological inventories, e.g. rapid assessment programs (RAPs), unlike most barcoding campaigns, are focused on particular geographic localities rather than on clades. Because of the potentially sparse phylogenetic sampling, the addition of DNA barcoding to RAPs may present a greater challenge for the identification of named species or for revealing cryptic diversity. In this article we evaluate the use of DNA barcoding for quantifying lineage diversity within a single sampling site as compared to clade-based sampling, and present examples from amphibians. We compared algorithms for identifying DNA barcode clusters (e.g. species, cryptic species or Evolutionary Significant Units) using previously published DNA barcode data obtained from geography-based sampling at a site in Central Panama, and from clade-based sampling in Madagascar. We found that clustering algorithms based on genetic distance performed similarly on sympatric as well as clade-based barcode data, while a promising coalescent-based method performed poorly on sympatric data. The various clustering algorithms were also compared in terms of speed and software implementation. Although each method has its shortcomings in certain contexts, we recommend the use of the ABGD method, which not only performs fairly well under either sampling method, but does so in a few seconds and with a user-friendly Web interface.</p>

				<title>Exploring the correlations between sequence evolution rate and phenotypic divergence across the Mammalian tree provides insights into adaptive evolution</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0897-0909</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sequence evolution behaves in a relatively consistent manner, leading to one of the fundamental paradigms in biology, the existence of a `molecular clock’. The molecular clock can be distilled to the concept of accumulation of substitutions, through time yielding a stable rate from which we can estimate lineage divergence. Over the last 50 years, evolutionary biologists have obtained an in-depth understanding of this clock’s nuances. It has been fine-tuned by taking into account the vast heterogeneity in rates across lineages and genes, leading to `relaxed’ molecular clock methods for timetree reconstruction. Sequence rate varies with life history traits including body size, generation time and metabolic rate, and we review recent studies on this topic. However, few studies have explicitly examined correlates between molecular evolution and morphological evolution. The patterns observed across diverse lineages suggest that rates of molecular and morphological evolution are largely decoupled. We discuss how identifying the molecular mechanisms behind rapid functional radiations are central to understanding evolution. The vast functional divergence within mammalian lineages that have relatively `slow’ sequence evolution refutes the hypotheses that pulses in diversification yielding major phenotypic change are the result of steady accumulation of substitutions. Patterns rather suggest phenotypic divergence is likely caused by regulatory alterations mediated through mechanisms such as insertions/deletions in functional regions. These can rapidly arise and sweep to fixation faster than predicted from a lineage’s sequence neutral substitution rate, enabling species to leapfrog between phenotypic `islands’. We suggest research directions that could illuminate mechanisms behind the functional diversity we see today.</p>

				<title>Complex genetic origin of Indian populations and its implications</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0911-0919</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indian populations are classified into various caste, tribe and religious groups, which altogether makes them very unique compared to rest of the world. The long-term firm socio-religious boundaries and the strict endogamy practices along with the evolutionary forces have further supplemented the existing high-level diversity. As a result, drawing definite conclusions on its overall origin, affinity, health and disease conditions become even more sophisticated than was thought earlier. In spite of these challenges, researchers have undertaken tireless and extensive investigations using various genetic markers to estimate genetic variation and its implication in health and diseases. We have demonstrated that the Indian populations are the descendents of the very first modern humans, who ventured the journey of out-of-Africa about 65,000 years ago. The recent gene flow from east and west Eurasia is also evident. Thus, this review attempts to summarize the unique genetic variation among Indian populations as evident from our extensive study among approximately 20,000 samples across India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The discrepancy between the X-ray and NMR structures of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase in relation to the functionally important plasticity of the molecule led to molecular dynamics simulations. The X-ray and the NMR studies along with the simulations indicated an inverse correlation between crowding and molecular volume. A detailed comparison of proteins for which X-ray and the NMR structures appears to confirm this correlation. In consonance with the reported results of the investigations in cellular compartments and aqueous solution, the comparison indicates that the crowding results in compaction of the molecule as well as change in its shape, which could specifically involve regions of the molecule important in function. Crowding could thus influence the action of proteins through modulation of the functionally important plasticity of the molecule.</p>

				<title>Transcription of gD and gI genes in BHV1-infected cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0971-0977</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glycoprotein D (gD) and glycoprotein I (gI) genes of bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1) are contiguous genes with 141 bp region between the two open reading frames (ORFs). Expression of gD and gI from a bicistronic construct containing complete gD and gI gene has been reported either through internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-like element or through the scanning and leakage model (Mukhopadhyay 2000). We here show by computational and experimental means that gD is expressed solely as bicistronic transcript comprising gD and gI coding region in BHV1-infected cells. gI ORF was also shown to express separately. An IRES-like element was also predicted by IRES predicting software in the middle of the gD coding region; within that region a putative promoter was also identified by promoterscan. The intergenic region between the two ORF showed extensive secondary structure which brings the stop codon of gD very close to start codon of gI gene. gD gene transcript in BHV1-infected cells was solely bicistronic. gI transcript was also present in the BHV1-infected cells but in low copy number. The results indicate that gI is probably transcribed from its own transcript in BHV1-infected cells.</p>

				<title>Cx43, ZO-1, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin in cataractous lens epithelial cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0979-0987</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Specimens of the anterior lens capsule with an attached monolayer of lens epithelial cells (LECs) were obtained from patients (𝑛=52) undergoing cataract surgery. Specimens were divided into three groups based on the type of cataract: nuclear cataract, cortical cataract and posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC). Clear lenses (𝑛=11) obtained from donor eyes were used as controls. Expression was studied by immunofluorescence, real-time PCR and Western blot. Statistical analysis was done using the student’s 𝑡-test. Immunofluorescence results showed punctate localization of Cx43 at the cell boundaries in controls, nuclear cataract and PSC groups. In the cortical cataract group, cytoplasmic pools of Cx43 without any localization at the cell boundaries were observed. Real-time PCR results showed significant up-regulation of Cx43 in nuclear and cortical cataract groups. Western blot results revealed significant increase in protein levels of Cx43 and significant decrease of ZO-1 in all three cataract groups. Protein levels of alpha-catenin were decreased significantly in nuclear and cortical cataract group. There was no significant change in expression of beta-catenin in the cataractous groups. Our findings suggest that ZO-1 and alpha-catenin are important for gap junctions containing Cx43 in the LECs. Alterations in cell junction proteins may play a role during formation of different types of cataract.</p>

				<title>Comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term Indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): <i>Acinetobacter</i> sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0989-0998</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were <i>Acinetobacter</i> sp., <i>Bifidobacterium</i> sp. and <i>Staphylococcus</i> sp. However, CB infant’s fecal microbiota was dominated with <i>Citrobacter</i> sp., <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Clostridium difficile</i>. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of <i>Bifidobacteria</i> species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of <i>Acinetobacter</i> sp. consisting of <i>Acinetobacter pittii</i> (former <i>Acinetobacter</i> genomic species 3), <i>Acinetobacter junii</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> in the VB infants clone library. Among these, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a known nosocomial pathogen and <i>Acinetobacter pittii</i> (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the <i>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</i>–<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.</p>

				<title>Sialyl Lewis x expression in cervical scrapes of premalignant lesions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0999-1004</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sialylated oligosaccharides of glycoproteins and glycolipids have been implicated in tumour progression and metastases. Altered expression of glycosidic antigens has been reported in cervical cancer. In cervix premalignant lesions, an increased expression of sialic acid has been reported. In the present study we determined the expression profiles of the glycosidic antigens Tn, sialyl Tn (sTn), Lewis a (Le<sup>a</sup>), sialyl Lewis a (sLe<sup>a</sup>), Lewis x (Le<sup>x</sup>) and sialyl Lewis x (sLe<sup>x</sup>) in cervical scrapes with cytological diagnoses of normal, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL). Cervical scrapings were collected to detect tumour antigens expressions by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies. Cytometry analysis of Tn, sTn, Le<sup>a</sup> and Le<sup>x</sup> did not reveal differences at the expression level among groups. The number of positive cells to sLe<sup>a</sup> antigen increased in the HGSIL group with respect to the normal group (𝑝=0.0495). The number of positive cells to sLe<sup>x</sup> antigen in the samples increased with respect to the grade of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) (𝑝 &#60; 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). The intensity of expression of this antigen increased in the HGSIL samples with respect to normal samples (𝑝 &#60; 0.0068). sLe<sup>x</sup> antigen could be a candidate to be used as biomarker for the early diagnosis of cervical cancer.</p>

				<title>Swainsonine promotes apoptosis in human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> through activation of mitochondrial pathway</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1005-1016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Swainsonine, a natural indolizidine alkaloid, has been reported to have antitumour effects, and can induce apoptosis in human gastric and lung cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the antitumour effects of swainsonine on several oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells and investigated relative molecular mechanisms. Swainsonine treatment inhibited the growth of Eca-109, TE-1 and TE-10 cells in a concentration-dependent manner as measured by MTT assay. Morphological observation, DNA laddering detection and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that swainsonine treatment induced Eca-109 cell apoptosis <i>in vitro</i>. Further results showed that swainsonine treatment up-regulated Bax, down-regulated Bcl-2 expression, triggered Bax translocation to mitochondria, destructed mitochondria integrity and activated mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, followed by the release of cytochrome c, which in turn activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, promoted the cleavage of PARP, resulting in Eca-109 cell apoptosis. Moreover, swainsonine treatment inhibited Bcl-2 expression, promoted Bax translocation, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in xenograft tumour cells, resulting in a significant decrease of tumour volume and tumour weight in the swainsonine-treated xenograft mice groups compared with that in the control group. Taken together, this study demonstrated that swainsonine inhibited Eca-109 cells growth through activation of mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent pathway.</p>

				<title>Effects of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia on amyloid accumulation in ovariectomized mice</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1017-1027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A central hypothesis in the study of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation and aggregation of 𝛽-amyloid peptide (A𝛽). Recent epidemiological studies suggest that patients with elevated cholesterol and decreased estrogen levels are more susceptible to AD through A𝛽 accumulation. To test the above hypothesis, we used ovariectomized with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (OVX) and hypercholesterolemia (HCL) diet alone mouse models. HPLC analysis reveals the presence of beta amyloid in the OVX and HCL mice brain. Congo red staining analysis revealed the extent of amyloid deposition in OVX and hypercholesterolemia mice brain. Overall, A𝛽 levels were higher in OVX mice than in HCL. Secondly, estrogen receptors 𝛼 (ER𝛼) were assessed by immunohistochemistry and this suggested that there was a decreased expression of ER 𝛼 in OVX animals when compared to hypercholesterolemic animals. A𝛽 was quantified by Western blot and ELISA analysis. Overall, Aβ levels were higher in OVX mice than in HCL mice. Our experimental results suggested that OVX animals were more susceptible to AD with significant increase in A𝛽 peptide.</p>

				<title>Identification and characterization of a gene encoding a putative lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase from <i>Arachis hypogaea</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1029-1039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase (LPAT) is the important enzyme responsible for the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), leading to the generation of phosphatidic acid (PA) in plant. Its encoding gene is an essential candidate for oil crops to improve oil composition and increase seed oil content through genetic engineering. In this study, a full-length <i>AhLPAT4</i> gene was isolated via cDNA library screening and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE); our data demonstrated that <i>AhLPAT4</i> had 1631 nucleotides, encoding a putative 43.8 kDa protein with 383 amino acid residues. The deduced protein included a conserved acyltransferase domain and four motifs (I–IV) with putative LPA and acyl-CoA catalytic and binding sites. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that AhLPAT4 contained four transmembrane domains (TMDs), localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane; detailed analysis indicated that motif I and motifs II–III in AhLPAT4 were separated by the third TMD, which located on cytosolic and ER luminal side respectively, and hydrophobic residues on the surface of AhLPAT4 protein fold to form a hydrophobic tunnel to accommodate the acyl chain. Subcellular localization analysis confirmed that AhLPAT4 was a cytoplasm protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AhLPAT4 had a high homology (63.7–78.3%) with putative LPAT4 proteins from <i>Glycine max, Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Ricinus communis</i>. <i>AhLPAT4</i> was ubiquitously expressed in diverse tissues except in flower, which is almost undetectable. The expression analysis in different developmental stages in peanut seeds indicated that <i>AhLPAT4</i> did not coincide with oil accumulation.</p>

				<title><i>COCHLEATA</i> controls leaf size and secondary inflorescence architecture via negative regulation of <i>UNIFOLIATA</i> (<i>LEAFY</i> ortholog) gene in garden pea <i>Pisum sativum</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1041-1059</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>UNIFOLIATA</i> [(<i>UNI</i>) or <i>UNIFOLIATA-TENDRILLED ACACIA</i> (<i>UNI-TAC</i>)] expression is known to be negatively regulated by <i>COCHLEATA</i> (<i>COCH</i>) in the differentiating stipules and flowers of <i>Pisum sativum</i>. In this study, additional roles of <i>UNI</i> and <i>COCH</i> in <i>P. sativum</i> were investigated. Comparative phenotyping revealed pleiotropic differences between <i>COCH</i> (<i>UNI-TAC</i> and <i>uni-tac</i>) and <i>coch</i> (<i>UNI-TAC</i> and <i>uni-tac</i>) genotypes of common genetic background. Secondary inflorescences were bracteole-less and bracteolated in <i>COCH</i> and <i>coch</i> genotypes, respectively. In comparison to the leaves and corresponding sub-organs and tissues produced on <i>COCH</i> plants, <i>coch</i> plants produced leaves of 1.5-fold higher biomass, 1.5-fold broader petioles and leaflets that were 1.8-fold larger in span and 1.2-fold dorso-ventrally thicker. <i>coch</i> leaflets possessed epidermal cells 1.3-fold larger in number and size, 1.4-fold larger spongy parenchyma cells and primary vascular bundles with 1.2-fold larger diameter . The transcript levels of <i>UNI</i> were at least 2-fold higher in <i>coch</i> leaves and secondary inflorescences than the corresponding <i>COCH</i> organs. It was concluded that <i>COCH</i> negatively regulated <i>UNI</i> in the differentiating leaves and secondary inflorescences and thereby controlled their sizes and/or structures. It was also surmised that <i>COCH</i> and <i>UNI</i> (<i>LFY</i> homolog) occur together widely in stipulate flowering plants.</p>

				<title>Characteristic differences in metabolite profile in male and female plants of dioecious <i>Piper betle</i> L.</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1061-1066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Piper betle</i> is a dioecious pan-Asiatic plant having cultural and medicinal uses. It belongs to the family Piperaceae and is a native of the tropics although it is also cultivated in subtropical areas. Flowering in <i>P. betle</i> occurs only in tropical regions. Due to lack of inductive floral cycles the plant remains in its vegetative state in the subtropics. Therefore, due to lack of flowering, gender distinction cannot be made the in the subtropics. Gender distinction in <i>P. betle</i> in vegetative state can be made using Direct Analysis in Real Time Mass Spectroscopy (DARTMS), a robust high-throughput method. DARTMS analysis of leaf samples of two male and six female plants showed characteristic differences in the spectra between male and female plants. Semi-quantitative differences in some of the identified peaks in male and female landraces showed gender-based differences in metabolites. Cluster analysis using the peaks at <i>m/z</i> 151, 193, 235 and 252 showed two distinct clusters of male and female landraces. It appears that male and female plants besides having flowers of different sexes also have characteristic differences in the metabolites representing two metabolic types.</p>

				<title>Rates and pattern of ovule abortion vis-à-vis <i>in situ</i> pollen germination in some populations of <i>Trifolium fragiferum</i> L.</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1067-1077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is based on four populations of <i>Trifolium fragiferum</i> L. of the family Fabaceae growing at four different sites in Jammu region, India. The species, which grows as a common weed in the area of study, follows an annual life cycle of about 3&#189;month in the subtropical climates of Jammu region. While all of these populations were recorded in full bloom during February and March, they displayed a temporal scatter. Detailed studies revealed these population types to be morphologically similar but distinct in the many aspects studied. An interesting phenomenon noted for the plants of this species was <i>in situ</i> pollen germination, which was recorded in about 28.8% of the flowers studied. The species under investigation also showed an appreciable amount of ovule abortion. The ovule abortion in pistils was found to be non-random, with the peduncular ovule aborting at a higher rate than the stylar one. The rates and patterns of ovule abortion were studied vis-à-vis <i>in situ</i> pollen germination and were compared between different populations. Interesting results were obtained, indicative of the fact that precocious pollen germination does affect the ovule abortion in one way or other.</p>

				<title>Aluminium localization and toxicity symptoms related to root growth inhibition in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) seedlings</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1079-1088</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We correlated root growth inhibition with aluminium (Al<sup>3+</sup>) localization and toxicity symptoms in rice roots using seedlings of two genotypes (tolerant and sensitive) that were exposed to different AlCl<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Al<sup>3+</sup> localization was evaluated by hematoxylin in primary roots and by morin in cross-sections of the root tips. Neutral invertase enzyme activity and callose (1$\to$3, 𝛽-D-glucan) accumulation were observed and compared with Al<sup>3+</sup> accumulation sites. Root growth was inhibited by Al<sup>3+</sup> in a concentration-specific manner and proportional to the increase of hematoxylin staining, being more pronounced in the sensitive genotype. Morin staining showed the presence of Al<sup>3+</sup> deep within the roots of the sensitive genotype, indicating that the metal was able to penetrate beyond the first few cell layers. In the tolerant genotype, Al<sup>3+</sup> penetration was restricted to the first two cell layers. Ruptures in exodermis and epidermis layers by lateral root protrusions in both genotypes allowed Al<sup>3+</sup> to enter into the roots. More intense activity of invertase in roots of the tolerant genotype was also observed, which could be related to greater root growth of this cultivar when submitted to Al<sup>3+</sup> stress. Moreover, Al<sup>3+</sup>-induced callose accumulation was a late response occurring in the same areas where Al<sup>3+</sup> was present.</p>

				<page>1089-1095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Required by an increasing amount of scientists, the <i>in silico</i> docking field is in full expansion, new algorithms and methods appearing at an exponential rate. The sheer range of available programs is overwhelming for the bench-working biologist, which is often discouraging by the lack of a graphical user interface, good user manual or literature to validate a given program. This mini-review attempts to present the docking problem and available solutions from a non-bioinformatician point of view and makes a selection of the available servers and programs. These tools are evaluated from several points of view, as numbers of citations, ease of usage and computer requirements. Finally, the capabilities and limitations as well as specific applications of <i>in silico</i> docking techniques are presented.</p>

				<title>The hnRNP A1 homolog Hrp36 is essential for normal development, female fecundity, omega speckle formation and stress tolerance in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Erratum</feature>
				<page>1096-1096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hrp36/Hrb87F is one of the most abundant and well-characterized hnRNP A homolog in <i>Drosophila</i> and is shown to have roles in regulation of alternative splicing, heterochromatin formation, neurodegeneration, etc. Yet, <i>hrp36</i> null individuals were reported to be viable and without any apparent phenotype, presumably because of overlapping functions provided by Hrp38 and related proteins. Here we show that loss of both copies of <i>hrp36</i> gene slows down development with significant reduction in adult life span, decreased female fecundity and high sensitivity to starvation and thermal stresses. In the absence of Hrp36, the nucleoplasmic omega speckles are nearly completely disrupted. The levels of nuclear matrix protein Megator and the chromatin remodeller ISWI are significantly elevated in principal cells of larval Malpighian tubules, which also display additional endoreplication cycles and good polytene chromosomes. We suggest that besides the non-coding hsr𝜔-n transcripts, the Hrp36 protein is also a core constituent of omega speckles. The heat-shock-induced association of other hnRNPs at the <i>hsr</i>𝜔 locus is affected in <i>hrp36</i> null cells, which may be one of the reasons for their high sensitivity to cell stress. Therefore, in spite of the functional redundancy provided by Hrp38, Hrp36 is essential for normal development and for survival under conditions of stress.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous light could be produced from the firefly by making it inhale vapours of ethyl acetate. Here we perform such a <i>control</i> experiment on the Indian species of the firefly <i>Luciola praeusta</i> Kiesenwetter 1874 (Coleoptera : Lampyridae : Luciolinae), and analyse the light in the microsecond time scale. The amplitude of the continuous train of triangular pulses is apparently altered in accordance with the instantaneous values of a hypothetical signal, which exhibits pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). In addition to sampling in amplitude, this scheme apparently provides sampling in time, representing pulse width modulation (PWM). A Fourier transform spectrum of this waveform shows the `carrier’ frequency and the accompanying `side bands’.</p>

				<title>Epicotyl morphophysiological dormancy in seeds of <i>Lilium polyphyllum</i> (Liliaceae)</title>
				<feature>Brief communications</feature>
				<page>0013-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dormancy-breaking and seed germination studies in genus <i>Lilium</i> reveal that the majority of <i>Lilium</i> spp. studied have an underdeveloped embryo at maturity, which grows inside the seed before the radicle emerges. Additionally, the embryo, radicle or cotyledon has a physiological component of dormancy; thus, <i>Lilium</i> seeds have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). A previous study suggested that seeds of <i>Lilium polyphyllum</i> have MPD but the study did not investigate the development of the embryo, which is one of the main criteria to determine MPD in seeds. To test this hypothesis, we investigated embryo growth and emergence of radicles and epicotyls in seeds over a range of temperatures. At maturity, seeds had underdeveloped embryos which developed fully at warm temperature within 6 weeks. Immediately after embryo growth, radicles also emerged at warm temperatures. However, epicotyls failed to emerge soon after radicle emergence. Epicotyls emerged from &#62; 90% seeds with an emerged radicle only after they were subjected to 2 weeks of cold moist stratification. The overall temperature requirements for dormancy-breaking and seed germination indicate a non-deep simple epicotyl MPD in <i>L. polyphyllum</i>.</p>

				<title>Lower incidence of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate in females: Is homocysteine a factor?</title>
				<feature>Brief communications</feature>
				<page>0021-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In India, as in other parts of the world, nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL&#177;P) is a highly prevalent birth defect, its incidence in males being twice that in females. A case–control association study has been carried out with respect to homocysteine level and <i>MTHFR</i> C677T, A1298C and <i>SLC19A1</i> (<i>RFC1</i>) G80A genotypes from an eastern Indian cohort to investigate whether Hcy and other Hcy-pathway genes also contribute to the risk level. While <i>MTHFR</i> 677T and <i>SLC19A1</i> 80G are individually and cumulatively risk factors, <i>SLC19A1</i> 80A appears to be protective against <i>MTHFR</i> 677T risk allele. Elevated Hcy associates with NSCL&#177;P both in case mothers and cases. Significantly, this difference shows a gender bias: the level of elevation of Hcy in female cases is distinctly higher than in males, and more case females are hyperhomocyteinemic than the case males. It implies that compared with the males, higher level of Hcy is needed for NSCL&#177;P to manifest in the females. We consider this as one of the possible factors why the incidence of this disorder in females is much lower than in males.</p>

				<title>Early repeated maternal separation induces alterations of hippocampus reelin expression in rats</title>
				<feature>Brief communications</feature>
				<page>0027-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The long-term effects of repeated maternal separation (MS) during early postnatal life on reelin expression in the hippocampus of developing rats were investigated in the present study. MS was carried out by separating Wistar rat pups singly from their mothers for 3 h a day during postnatal days (PND) 2–14. Reelin mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus were determined using qRT-PCR and Western blotting, at PND 22, PND 60 and PND 90. MS resulted in the loss of body weight in the developing rats, and reelin mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus generally were down-regulated over the developing period, but the reelin mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus of 90-day-old male rats were up-regulated. These findings suggest that the long-term effects of MS on the expression levels of hippocampal reelin mRNA and protein depends on the age at which the stressed rats’ brains were collected; reelin had important implications for the maternal-neonate interaction needed for normal brain development. In conclusion, repeated MS occurring during early postnatal life may cause the alterations of hippocampal reelin expression with the increasing age of developing rats.</p>

In this study, transcripts of the UL140 and UL141, two of the UL/b&#8242; genes, were identified in late RNAs of three HCMV isolates using Northern blot hybridization, cDNA library screening and RACE-PCR. At least three transcripts with length of 2800, 2400 and 1700 nt, as well as a group of transcripts of about 1000–1300 nt, were found in this gene region with an accordant 3&#8242; ends. Among the transcripts, two initiated upstream of the start code of the UL140 gene and contained the UL140 and UL141 open reading frame (ORF), one initiated in the middle of the UL140 gene, and could encode short ORFs upstream of the UL141 ORF. A group of transcripts initiated upstream or downstream of the start code of the UL141 gene, and could encode `nested’ ORFs, including the UL141 ORF. These `nested’ ORFs possess different initiation sites but the same termination site as that of the UL141 ORF.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Virus encoded RNA-silencing suppressors (RSSs) are the key components evolved by the viruses to counter RNA-silencing defense of plants. Whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses infecting tomato crop code for five different proteins, ORF AC4, ORF AC2 and ORF AV2 in DNA-A component, ORF BV1 in DNA-B and ORF 𝛽C1 in satellite DNA 𝛽 which are predicted to function as silencing suppressors. In the present study suppressor function of ORF 𝛽C1 of three betasatellites <i>Tomato leaf curl Bangalore betasatellite</i> ToLCBB-[IN:Hess:08], <i>Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite</i> CLCuMB–[IN:Sri:02] and <i>Luffa leaf distortion betasatellite</i> LuLDB-[IN:Lu:04] were examined. Agroinfiltration of GFP-silenced <i>Nicotiana tabaccum cv</i>. Xanthi with the cells expressing 𝛽C1 protein resulted in reversal of silenced GFP expression. GFP-siRNA level was more than 50-fold lower compared to silenced plants in plants infiltrated with 𝛽C1 gene from ToLCBB. However, in the case of 35S-𝛽C1 CLCuMB and 35S-𝛽C1 LuLDB construct, although GFP was expressed, siRNA level was not reduced, indicating that the step at which 𝛽C1 interfere in RNA-silencing pathway is different.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the DNA damaging effects of amitraz on human lymphocytes in the Comet assay</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0053-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amitraz is formamidine pesticide widely used as insecticide and acaricide. In veterinary medicine, amitraz has important uses against ticks, mites and lice on animals. Also, amitraz is used in apiculture to control <i>Varroa destructor</i>. It this study, the alkaline Comet assay was used to evaluate DNA damaging effects of amitraz in human lymphocytes. Isolated human lymphocytes were incubated with varying concentrations of amitraz (0.035, 0.35, 3.5, 35 and 350 𝜇g/mL). The Comet assay demonstrated that all concentrations of amitraz caused statistically significant increase in the level of DNA damage, thus indicating that amitraz possesses genotoxic potential. The concentration of amitraz that produced the highest DNA damage (3.5 𝜇g/mL) was chosen for further analysis with the antioxidant catalase. The obtained results showed that co-treatment with antioxidant catalase (100 IU/mL or 500 IU/mL) significantly reduced the level of DNA damage, indicating the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species in DNA damaging effects of amitraz. Flow cytometric analysis revealed increase of the apoptotic index following treatment with amitraz. However, co-treatment with catalase reduced the apoptotic index, while treatment with catalase alone reduced the percentage of apoptotoc cells even in comparison with the negative control. Therefore, catalase had protective effects against ROS-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis.</p>

				<title>Fatty acyl chain-dependent but charge-independent association of the SH4 domain of Lck with lipid membranes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0063-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The SH4 domain of Src family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases represents the extreme N-terminal 1–16 amino acid region which mediates membrane association of these proteins and facilitates their functions. The SH4 domains among Src members lack well-defined sequence consensus and vary in the net charge. However, they readily anchor to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane upon fatty acid acylation. Here, we report the membrane association of differentially acylated SH4 domain of Lck kinase, which has net negative charge at physiological pH. Our results suggest that despite the net negative charge, the SH4 domain of Lck associates with membranes upon fatty acid acylation. While myristoylation at the N-terminus is sufficient for providing membrane anchorage, multiple acylation determines orientation of the peptide chain with respect to the lipid bilayer. Hence, fatty acylation serves more than just a lipid anchor. It has an important role in regulating the spatial orientation of the peptide domain with respect to the lipid bilayer, which could be important for the interaction of the other domains of these kinases with their partners.</p>

				<title>Vps1 in the late endosome-to-vacuole traffic</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0073-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vacuolar protein sorting 1 (Vps1), the yeast homolog to human dynamin, is a GTP hydrolyzing protein, which plays an important role in protein sorting and targeting between the Golgi and late endosomal compartments. In this study, we assessed the functional significance of Vps1 in the membrane traffic towards the vacuole. We show here that <i>vps1</i>𝛥 cells accumulated FM4-64 to a greater extent than wild-type (WT) cells, suggesting slower endocytic degradation traffic toward the vacuole. In addition, we observed that two endosome-to-vacuole traffic markers, DsRed-FYVE and Ste2-GFP, were highly accumulated in Vps1-deficient cells, further supporting Vps1’s implication in efficient trafficking of endocytosed materials to the vacuole. Noteworthy, a simultaneous imaging analysis in conjunction with FM4-64 pulse-chase experiment further revealed that Vps1 plays a role in late endosome to the vacuole transport. Consistently, our subcellular localization analysis showed that Vps1 is present at the late endosome. The hyperaccumulation of endosomal intermediates in the <i>vps1</i> mutant cells appears to be caused by the disruption of integrity of HOPS tethering complexes, manifested by mislocalization of Vps39 to the cytoplasm. Finally, we postulate that Vps1 functions together with the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) complex at the late endosomal compartments, based on the observation that the double mutants, in which <i>VPS1</i> along with singular ESCRT I, II and III genes have been disrupted, exhibited synthetic lethality. Together, we propose that Vps1 is required for correct and efficient trafficking from the late endosomal compartments to the vacuole.</p>

				<title>Cellular ontogeny of RBMY during human spermatogenesis and its role in sperm motility</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0085-0092</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Y-chromosome-encoded gene <i>RBMY</i> (RNA-binding motif on Y) is a male germline RNA-binding protein and is postulated to be a RNA-splicing regulator. In order to understand the roles of RBMY in different stages of male gamete maturation, the present study aimed at determining its cellular expression during spermatogenesis, spermeogenesis and in mature spermatozoa. In the spermatogonia (cKIT-positive cells), RBMY immunolocalized as two distinct foci, one in the nucleolus and the other in the subnuclear region; in the spermatocytes (cKIT-negative cells), the nucleus had punctuate staining with a subnuclear foci; in the pachytene cells, the protein was localized as a punctuate pattern in the nucleus spread along the elongating chromosomes. In the round and the elongating spermatids, the protein expression was polarized and restricted to the cytoplasm and in the developing mid-piece. In testicular and ejaculated sperm, RBMY was localized to the mid-piece region and weakly in the tail. Incubation of spermatozoa with the RBMY antibody reduced its motility. The spatial differences in expression of RBMY in the germ cells and the presences of this protein in post-meiotic cells and in transcriptionally inert spermatozoa suggest its involvement in multiple functions beyond RNA splicing. One such possible function of RBMY could be its involvement in sperm motility.</p>

				<title>Effect of normabaric hyperoxia treatment on neuronal damage following fluid percussion injury in the striatum of mice: A morphological approach</title>

				<page>0093-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes significant mortality in most developing countries worldwide. At present, it is imperative to identify a treatment to address the devastating post-TBI consequences. Therefore, the present study has been performed to assess the specific effect of immediate exposure to normabaric hyperoxia (NBO) after fluid percussion injury FPI) in the striatum of mice. To execute FPI, mice were anesthetised and sorted into </p>
					<ol>
						<li>a TBI group,</li>
						<li>a sham group without injury and</li>
						<li>a TBI group treated with immediate exposure to NBO for 3 h.</li>
					</ol> 
					<p>Afterwards, brains were harvested for morphological assessment. The results revealed no changes in morphological and neuronal damage in the sham group as compared to the TBI group. Conversely, the TBI group showed severe morphological changes as well as neuronal damage as compared to the TBI group exposed to NBO for 3 h. Interestingly, our findings also suggested that NBO treatment could diminish the neuronal damage in the striatum of mice after FPI. Neuronal damage was evaluated at different points of injury and the neighbouring areas using morphology, neuronal apoptotic cell death and pan-neuronal markers to determine the complete neuronal structure. In conclusion, immediate exposure to NBO following FPI could be a potential therapeutic approach to reduce neuronal damage in the TBI model.</p>

				<title>Regulation of DU145 prostate cancer cell growth by Scm-like with four mbt domains 2</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0105-0112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mammalian SFMBTs have been considered to be polycomb group repressors. However, molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian SFMBTs-mediated gene regulation and their biological function have not been characterized. In the present study, we identified YY1 and methylated histones as interacting proteins of human SFMBT2. We also found that human SFMBT2 binds preferentially to methylated histone H3 and H4 that are associated with transcriptional repression. Using DU145 prostate cancer cells as a model, we showed that SFMBT2 has a transcriptional repression activity on <i>HOXB13</i> gene expression. In addition, occupancy of SFMBT2 coincided with enrichment of diand tri-methylated H3K9 and H4K20 as well as tri-methylated H3K27 at the <i>HOXB13</i> gene promoter. When <i>SFMBT2</i> was depleted by siRNA in DU145 prostate cancer cells, significant up-regulation of <i>HOXB13</i> gene expression and decreased cell growth were observed. Collectively, our findings indicate that human SFMBT2 may regulate cell growth via epigenetic regulation of <i>HOXB13</i> gene expression in DU145 prostate cancer cells.</p>

				<page>0113-0122</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Telomere shortening is emerging as a biological indicator of accelerated aging and aging-related diseases including type 2 diabetes. While telomere length measurements were largely done in white blood cells, there is lack of studies on telomere length in relation to oxidative stress in target tissues affected in diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to induct oxidative stress in adipocytes and to test whether these adipocytes exhibit shortened telomeres, senescence and functional impairment. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were subjected to oxidative stress and senescence induction by a variety of means for 2 weeks (exogenous application of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, glucose oxidase, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and glucose oscillations). Cells were probed for reactive oxygen species generation (ROS), DNA damage, mRNA and protein expression of senescent and pro-inflammatory markers, telomere length and glucose uptake. Compared to untreated cells, both ROS generation and DNA damage were significantly higher in cells subjected to oxidative stress and senescence. Adipocytes subjected to oxidative stress also showed shortened telomeres and increased mRNA and protein expression of p53, p21, TNF𝛼 and IL-6. Senescent cells were also characterized by decreased levels of adiponectin and impaired glucose uptake. Briefly, adipocytes under oxidative stress exhibited increased ROS generation, DNA damage, shortened telomeres and switched to senescent/pro-inflammatory phenotype with impaired glucose uptake.</p>

				<title>Derivation, characterization and retinal differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0123-0134</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Millions of people world over suffer visual disability due to retinal dystrophies which can be age-related or a genetic disorder resulting in gradual degeneration of the retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells and photoreceptors. Therefore, cell replacement therapy offers a great promise in treating such diseases. Since the adult retina does not harbour any stem cells, alternative stem cell sources like the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a great promise for generating different cell types of the retina. Here, we report the derivation of four iPSC lines from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using a cocktail of recombinant retroviruses carrying the genes for Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc. The iPS clone MEF-4F3 was further characterized for stemness marker expression and stable reprogramming by immunocytochemistry, FACS and RT-PCR analysis. Methylation analysis of the nanog promoter confirmed the reprogrammed epigenetic state. Pluripotency was confirmed by embryoid body (EB) formation and lineage-specific marker expression. Also, upon retinal differentiation, patches of pigmented cells with typical cobble-stone phenotype similar to RPE cells are generated within 6 weeks and they expressed ZO-1 (tight junction protein), RPE65 and bestrophin (mature RPE markers) and showed phagocytic activity by the uptake of fluorescent latex beads.</p>

				<title>Potential of Raloxifene in reversing osteoarthritis-like alterations in rat chondrocytes: An <i>in vitro</i> model study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0135-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Raloxifene (Ral) on degeneration-related changes in osteoarthritis (OA)-like chondrocytes using two- and three-dimensional models. Five-azacytidine (Aza-C) was used to induce OA-like alterations in rat articular chondrocytes and the model was verified at molecular and macrolevels. Chondrocytes were treated with Ral (1, 5 and 10 𝜇M) for 10 days. Caspase-3 activity, gene expressions of aggrecan, collagen II, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen X, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-13, MMP-3 and MMP-2), and MMP-13, MMP-3 and MMP-2 protein expressions were studied in two-dimensional model. Matrix deposition and mechanical properties of agarose-chondrocyte discs were evaluated in three-dimensional model. One 𝜇M Ral reduced expression of OA-related genes, decreased apoptosis, and MMP-13 and MMP-3 protein expressions. It also increased aggrecan and collagen II gene expressions relative to untreated OA-like chondrocytes. In three-dimensional model, 1 𝜇M Ral treatment resulted in increased collagen deposition and improved mechanical properties, although a significant increase for sGAG was not observed. In summation, 1 𝜇M Ral improved matrix-related activities, whereas dose increment reversed these effects except ALP gene expression and sGAG deposition. These results provide evidence that low-dose Ral has the potential to cease or reduce the matrix degeneration in OA.</p>

				<title>Rhamnolipid but not motility is associated with the initiation of biofilm seeding dispersal of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strain PA17</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0149-0156</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seeding dispersal is an active detachment exhibit in aging <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilm. Yet, effect factors of this process in the biofilm of clinical isolated mucoid <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strain remain to be better characterized. In our previous work, one mucoid <i>P. earuginosa</i> strain PA17 was isolated from a patient with recurrent pulmonary infection. In this study, confocal scanning laser microscope combined with LIVE/DEAD viability staining revealed that PA17 biofilm exhibited earlier seeding dispersal than non-mucoid PAO1. We further compared the motility and the expression of motility-associated gene during biofilm development between PA17 and PAO1. PA17 was found to be impaired in all three kinds of motility compared to PAO1. Moreover, we investigated the expression of rhamnolipid-associated genes in PA17 and PAO1 biofilm. The expression of these genes was in accordance with the process of seeding dispersal. Our results indicated that rhamnolipid but not motility is associated with the initiation of seeding dispersal of PA17 biofilm.</p>

				<title>Seagrasses in tropical Australia, productive and abundant for decades decimated overnight</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0157-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seagrass ecosystems provide unique coastal habitats critical to the life cycle of many species. Seagrasses are a major store of organic carbon. While seagrasses are globally threatened and in decline, in Cairns Harbour, Queensland, on the tropical east coast of Australia, they have flourished. We assessed seagrass distribution in Cairns Harbour between 1953 and 2012 from historical aerial photographs, Google map satellite images, existing reports and our own surveys of their distribution. Seasonal seagrass physiology was assessed through gross primary production, respiration and photosynthetic characteristics of three seagrass species, <i>Cymodocea serrulata, Thalassia hemprichii</i> and <i>Zostera muelleri</i>. At the higher water temperatures of summer, respiration rates increased in all three species, as did their maximum rates of photosynthesis. All three seagrasses achieved maximum rates of photosynthesis at low tide and when they were exposed. For nearly six decades there was little change in seagrass distribution in Cairns Harbour. This was most likely because the seagrasses were able to achieve sufficient light for growth during intertidal and low tide periods. With historical data of seagrass distribution and measures of species production and respiration, could seagrass survival in a changing climate be predicted? Based on physiology, our results predicted the continued maintenance of the Cairns Harbour seagrasses, although one species was more susceptible to thermal disturbance. However, in 2011 an unforeseen episodic disturbance – Tropical Cyclone Yasi – and associated floods lead to the complete and catastrophic loss of all the seagrasses in Cairns Harbour.</p>

				<title>Excised radicle tips as a source of genomic DNA for PCR-based genotyping and melting curve analysis in cotton</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0167-0172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genomic DNA isolation in cotton is complicated because of the presence of secondary metabolites that are inhibitory to PCR amplification. We report here that radicle tips, but not other parts of cotton seedlings, yield high-quality DNA that is readily amenable for PCR. The radicle-tip-excised seedlings retain viability because of the formation of adventitious roots. We demonstrate the utility of this method in distinguishing homozygotes from heterozygotes in a cotton breeding population and in hybrid seed purity testing.</p>

				<title>An algorithm to find all palindromic sequences in proteins</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0173-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A palindrome is a set of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards. Since the discovery of palindromic peptide sequences two decades ago, little effort has been made to understand its structural, functional and evolutionary significance. Therefore, in view of this, an algorithm has been developed to identify all perfect palindromes (excluding the palindromic subset and tandem repeats) in a single protein sequence. The proposed algorithm does not impose any restriction on the number of residues to be given in the input sequence. This avant-garde algorithm will aid in the identification of palindromic peptide sequences of varying lengths in a single protein sequence.</p>

				<title>Cloning, sequencing and expression of cDNA encoding growth hormone from Indian catfish (<i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i>)</title>
				<feature>Erratum</feature>
				<page>0179-0179</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A tissue-specific cDNA library was constructed using polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA from pituitary glands of the Indian catfish <i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i> (Bloch) and a cDNA clone encoding growth hormone (GH) was isolated. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers representing the conserved regions of fish GH sequences the 3&#8242; region of catfish GH cDNA (540 bp) was cloned by random amplification of cDNA ends and the clone was used as a probe to isolate recombinant phages carrying the full-length cDNA sequence. The full-length cDNA clone is 1132 bp in length, coding for an open reading frame (ORF) of 603 bp; the reading frame encodes a putative polypeptide of 200 amino acids including the signal sequence of 22 amino acids. The 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; untranslated regions of the cDNA are 58 bp and 456 bp long, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of <i>H. fossils</i> GH shared 98% homology with other catfishes. Mature GH protein was efficiently expressed in bacterial and zebrafish systems using appropriate expression vectors. The successful expression of the cloned GH cDNA of catfish confirms the functional viability of the clone.</p>

				<title>Commentary: On toxic effects of scientific journals</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0189-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The advent of online publishing greatly facilitates the dissemination of scientific results. This revolution might have led to the untimely death of many traditional publishing companies, since today’s scientists are perfectly capable of writing, formatting and uploading files to appropriate websites that can be consulted by colleagues and the general public alike. They also have the intellectual resources to criticize each other and organize an anonymous peer review system. The Open Access approach appears promising in this respect, but we cannot ignore that it is fraught with editorial and economic problems. A few powerful publishing companies not only managed to survive, but also rake up considerable profits. Moreover, they succeeded in becoming influential ‘trendsetters’ since they decide which papers deserve to be published. To make money, one must set novel trends, like Christian Dior or Levi’s in fashion, and open new markets, for example in Asia. In doing so, the publishers tend to supplant both national and transnational funding agencies in defining science policy. In many cases, these agencies tend simply to adopt the commercial criteria defined by the journals, forever eager to improve their impact factors. It is not obvious that the publishers of scientific journals, the editorial boards that they appoint, or the people who sift through the vast numbers of papers submitted to a handful of ‘top’ journals are endowed with sufficient insight to set the trends of future science. It seems even less obvious that funding agencies should blindly follow the fashion trends set by the publishers. The perverse relationships between private publishers and public funding agencies may have a toxic effect on science policy.</p>

Citrus plants infected by the HLB bacterium may not show visible symptoms sometimes for years following infection. The aim of this study was to develop effective gene-specific primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction based method for quick screening of HLB disease. Thirty-two different gene-specific primer pairs, across the <i>Ca</i>. Liberibacter asiaticus genome, were successfully developed. The possibility of these primer pairs for cross-genome amplification across `<i>Ca</i>. Liberibacter africanus’ and `<i>Ca</i>. Liberibacter americanus’ were tested. The applicability of these primer pairs for detection and differentiation of <i>Ca</i> Liberibacter spp. is discussed.</p>

				<title>Identification of bifidobacteria isolated from Asian elephant (<i>Elephas maximus</i>)</title>
				<feature>Brief communications</feature>
				<page>0239-0243</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bifidobacteria are considered as one of the key genera in intestinal tracts of animals, and their species composition vary depending on the host. The aim of this study was to identify faecal bifidobacteria from Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>), housed in Zoological gardens (Ostrava, Czech Republic). Using culturing, bifidobacteria were found in counts 7.60&#177;0.56 log CFU/g. Twenty-six pure strains were isolated from faeces of Asian elephant. The isolates were clustered into two groups according to fingerprinting profiles and fermentation characteristic. Bacteria were identified by a combination of MALDI-TOF MS, PCR methods and sequencing as <i>B. boum</i> (12 isolates) and <i>B. adolescentis</i> (14 isolates). Elephant strains showed different fingerprinting profiles than type and collection strains. Since these two species are frequently isolated from gastrointestinal tract of herbivores, they seem to be typical of animals fed plant diets.</p>

				<title>A mini-IRES sequence for stringent selection of high producers</title>
				<feature>Brief communications</feature>
				<page>0245-0249</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) sequences have been widely used to link the expression of two independent proteins on the same mRNA transcript. Genes encoding fluorescent proteins or drug-resistance enzymes are usually placed downstream of IRES, serving as expression indicators or selection markers. In biological applications where the upstream gene-of-interest is to be expressed at extremely high levels, it is often desirable to purposely reduce IRES downstream gene expression to economize the cellular resources and/or to generate more stringent selection pressure. Here we describe a miniature IRES mutant sequence (IRESmut3) with dramatically diminished co-translational efficiency to fulfill these purposes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study the most efficient 𝑅-factor controlling the <i>ars</i> operon was selected after screening of 39 <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolates by minimum inhibitory concentration test (MIC) studies from water samples of different geographical locations of India. Among all, strain isolated from Hooghly River (West Bengal) was found to have maximum tolerance towards arsenic and was further used for the development of bioreporter bacteria. Cloning of the <i>ars</i> regulatory element along with operator-promotor and <i>luxCDABE</i> from <i>Photobacteria</i> into expression vector has been accomplished by following recombinant DNA protocols. The bioreporter sensor system developed in this study can measure the estimated range of 0.74–60 𝜇g of As/L and is both specific and selective for sensing bioavailable As. The constructed bacterial biosensor was further used for the determination of arsenic ion concentration in different environmental samples of India.</p>

				<title>Role of amylase, mucin, IgA and albumin on salivary protein buffering capacity: A pilot study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0259-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been suggested that proteins serve as major salivary buffers below pH5. It remains unclear, however, which salivary proteins are responsible for these buffering properties. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the correlation between salivary concentration of total protein, amylase, mucin, immunoglobulin A (IgA), albumin and total salivary protein buffering capacity at a pH range of 4–5. In addition, the buffering capacity and the number of carboxylic acid moieties of single proteins were assessed.</p>
					<p>Stimulated saliva samples were collected at 9:00, 13:00 and 17:00 from 4 healthy volunteers on 3 successive days. The buffering capacities were measured for total salivary protein or for specific proteins. Also, the concentration of total protein, amylase, mucin, IgA and albumin were analysed.</p>
					<p>Within the limits of the current study, it was found that salivary protein buffering capacity was highly positively correlated with total protein, amylase and IgA concentrations. A weak correlation was observed for both albumin and mucin individually. Furthermore, the results suggest that amylase contributed to 35% of the salivary protein buffering capacity in the pH range of 4–5.</p>

				<title>A unique DNA repair and recombination gene (<i>rec</i>N) sequence for identification and intraspecific molecular typing of bacterial wilt pathogen <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> and its comparative analysis with ribosomal DNA sequences</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0267-0278</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ribosomal gene sequences are a popular choice for identification of bacterial species and, often, for making phylogenetic interpretations. Although very popular, the sequences of 16S rDNA and 16-23S intergenic sequences often fail to differentiate closely related species of bacteria. The availability of complete genome sequences of bacteria, in the recent years, has accelerated the search for new genome targets for phylogenetic interpretations. The recently published full genome data of nine strains of <i>R. solanacearum</i>, which causes bacterial wilt of crop plants, has provided enormous genomic choices for phylogenetic analysis in this globally important plant pathogen. We have compared a gene candidate <i>rec</i>N, which codes for DNA repair and recombination function, with 16S rDNA/16-23S intergenic ribosomal gene sequences for identification and intraspecific phylogenetic interpretations in <i>R. solanacearum. rec</i>N gene sequence analysis of <i>R. solanacearum</i> revealed subgroups within phylotypes (or newly proposed species within plant pathogenic genus, <i>Ralstonia</i>), indicating its usefulness for intraspecific genotyping. The taxonomic discriminatory power of <i>rec</i>N gene sequence was found to be superior to ribosomal DNA sequences. In all, the <i>rec</i>N-sequence-based phylogenetic tree generated with the Bayesian model depicted 21 haplotypes against 15 and 13 haplotypes obtained with 16S rDNA and 16-23S rDNA intergenic sequences, respectively. Besides this, we have observed high percentage of polymorphic sites (S 23.04%), high rate of mutations (Eta 276) and high codon bias index (CBI 0.60), which makes the <i>rec</i>N an ideal gene candidate for intraspecific molecular typing of this important plant pathogen.</p>

				<title>Identification of a premature termination of DNA polymerization <i>in vitro</i> by Klenow fragment mutants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0279-0289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DNA polymerization products by Klenow fragment (KF) are blunt-ended. In the present study, we found that the Klenow fragment mutants with partial deletions of thumb subdomain were unable to extend primers to the 5&#8242; terminal of templates, thus creating 5&#8242; overhanging sticky ends 2 nt long. We termed this phenomenon as PmTP (premature termination of polymerization). The KF mutants produced homogenous sticky-ended products only under mild reaction conditions, whereas under vigorous reaction conditions, the sticky ends were prone to be blunt-ended. It was also identified that deletions of more than four residues of KF thumb subdomain could induce PmTP, and two-residue deletion of KF thumb subdomain only induced PmTP in a lower-concentration situation. Structure modelling analysis suggested that shortening or destruction of 𝛼 helix H<sub>1</sub> at the tip of the thumb subdomain was crucial to PmTP, while the conserved residues in front of 𝛼 helix was less important. PmTP might be caused by the reduced DNA-binding affinity of the mutants. The sticky ends made by PmTP have potential applications in gene splicing and molecular cloning techniques.</p>

				<title>Spo0A positively regulates <i>epr</i> expression by negating the repressive effect of co-repressors, SinR and ScoC, in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0291-0299</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Bacillus subtilis</i> under nutritional deprivation exhibits several physiological responses such as synthesis of degradative enzymes, motility, competence, sporulation, etc. At the onset of post-exponential phase the global response regulator, Spo0A, directly or indirectly activates the expression of genes involved in the above processes. These genes are repressed during the exponential phase by a group of proteins called transition state regulators, e.g. AbrB, ScoC and SinR. One such post-exponentially expressed gene is <i>epr</i>, which encodes a minor extracellular serine protease and is involved in the swarming motility of <i>B. subtilis</i>. Deletion studies of the upstream region of <i>epr</i> promoter revealed that <i>epr</i> is co-repressed by transition state regulators, SinR and ScoC. Our study shows that Spo0A positively regulates <i>epr</i> expression by nullifying the repressive effect of co-repressors, SinR and ScoC. We demonstrate via <i>in vitro</i> mobility shift assays that Spo0A binds to the upstream region of <i>epr</i> promoter and in turn occludes the binding site of one of the co-repressor, SinR. This explains the mechanism behind the positive regulatory effect of Spo0A on <i>epr</i> expression.</p>

				<title>Transcriptome analysis of <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> embryo using expressed sequence tags</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0301-0309</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Germ band retraction (GBR) stage is one of the important stages during insect development. It is associated with an extensive epithelial morphogenesis and may also be pivotal in generation of morphological diversity in insects. Despite its importance, only a handful of studies report the transcriptome repertoire of this stage in insects. Here, we report generation, annotation and analysis of ESTs from the embryonic stage (16–22 h post fertilization) of laboratory-reared <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> mosquitoes. A total of 1002 contigs were obtained upon clustering of 1140 high-quality ESTs, which demonstrates an astonishingly low transcript redundancy (12.1%). Putative functions were assigned only to 213 contigs (21%), comprising mainly of transcripts encoding protein synthesis machinery. Approximately 78% of the transcripts remain uncharacterized, illustrating a lack of sequence information about the genes expressed in the embryonic stages of mosquitoes. This study highlights several novel transcripts, which apart from insect development, may significantly contribute to the essential biological complexity underlying insect viability in adverse environments. Nonetheless, the generated sequence information from this work provides a comprehensive resource for genome annotation, microarray development, phylogenetic analysis and other molecular biology applications in entomology.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Classic characteristics are poor predictors of the risk of thromboembolism. Thus, better markers for the carotid atheroma plaque formation and symptom causing are needed. Our objective was to study by microarray analysis gene expression of genes involved in homeostasis of iron and heme in carotid atheroma plaque from the same patient. mRNA gene expression was measured by an Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using RNA prepared from 68 specimens of endarteriectomy from 34 patients. Two genes involved in iron-heme homeostasis, CD163 and heme oxygenase (HO-1), were analysed in 34 plaques. CD163 (2.18, 𝑝=1.45E−08) and HO-1 (fold-change 2.67, 𝑝=2.07E−09) mRNAs were induced. We suggest that atheroma plaques show a more pronounced induction of CD163 and HO-1. Although further evidence is needed, our results support previous data. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing gene expression between intact arterial tissue and carotid plaque using microarray analysis.</p>

				<title>Changes in leaf proteome profile of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> in response to salicylic acid</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0317-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Salicylic acid (SA) has been implicated in determining the outcome of interactions between many plants and their pathogens. Global changes in response to this phytohormone have been observed at the transcript level, but little is known of how it induces changes in protein abundance. To this end we have investigated the effect of 1 mM SA on soluble proteins of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leaves by proteomic analysis. An initial study at transcript level has been performed on temporal landscape, which revealed that induction of most of the SA-responsive genes occurs within 3 to 6 h post treatment (HPT) and the expression peaked within 24 HPT. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis has been used to identify differentially expressed proteins and 63 spots have been identified successfully. This comparative proteomic profiling of SA treated leaves versus control leaves demonstrated the changes of many defence related proteins like pathogenesis related protein 10a (PR10a), disease-resistance-like protein, putative late blight-resistance protein, WRKY4, MYB4, etc. along with gross increase in the rate of energy production, while other general metabolism rate is slightly toned down, presumably signifying a transition from ‘normal mode’ to ‘defence mode’.</p>

				<title>Development of rapid phenotypic system for the identification of Gram-negative oxidase-positive bacilli in resource-limited settings</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0329-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens is a fundamental goal of clinical microbiology. The diagnosis and surveillance of diseases is dependent, to a great extent, on laboratory services, which cannot function without effective reliable reagents and diagnostics. Despite the advancement in microbiology diagnosis globally, resource-limited countries still struggle to provide an acceptable diagnosis quality which helps in clinical disease management and improve their mortality and morbidity data. During this study an indigenous product, Quick Test Strip (QTS) NE, was developed for the rapid identification of biochemically slower group of Gram-negative oxidase-positive bacilli that covers 19 different bacterial genera. Some of the members belonging to these groups are well-established human pathogens, e.g. various species of <i>Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Aeromonas, Achromobacter</i> and <i>Stenotrophomonas</i>. This study also evaluates the performance of QTS-NE by comparing with genotypic characterization methods. A total of 232 clinical and reference bacterial isolates were tested by three different methods. QTS-NE provides 100% concordant results with other rapid identification and molecular characterization methods and confirms the potential to be used in clinical diagnosis.</p>

				<title>Dietary diversification and variations in the number of labrum sensilla in grasshoppers: Which came first?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0339-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The diversity of the diet of grasshoppers (Acrididae, Orthoptera) is related to multiple factors, including the chemoreceptors on the antennae, palps and on the epipharyngeal face of the labrum. In the present study, we sought to understand the nature of the diet of 12 Moroccan acridian species and to try to relate various aspects of their diet to the number of labrum sensilla. If the effect of the labrum size on the number of sensilla is removed, four groups of species are recorded:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>polyphagous species with a broad diet and numerous sensilla;</li>
						<li>polyphagous species with a graminivorous diet and numerous sensilla;</li>
						<li>oligophagous species feeding exclusively on Poaceae and with a medium number of sensilla; and</li>
						<li>strictly monophagous species feeding on a single plant species and with the smallest number of sensilla.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>These observations show the close relationship between the diet and the number of labrum sensilla. However, <i>Sphingonotus rubescens</i>, a polyphagous species, is an exception to this trend as it harbours a medium number of sensilla. We propose that the modification in the number of labrum sensilla is a result of a progressive adaptation to a different diet and does not represent its cause.</p>

				<title>Inactivation of Tor proteins affects the dynamics of endocytic proteins in early stage of endocytosis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0351-0361</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tor2 is an activator of the Rom2/Rho1 pathway that regulates 𝛼-factor internalization. Since the recruitment of endocytic proteins such as actin-binding proteins and the amphiphysins precedes the internalization of 𝛼-factor, we hypothesized that loss of Tor function leads to an alteration in the dynamics of the endocytic proteins. We report here that endocytic proteins, Abp1 and Rvs167, are less recruited to endocytic sites not only in <i>tor2</i> but also <i>tor1</i> mutants. Furthermore, we found that the endocytic proteins Rvs167 and Sjl2 are completely mistargeted to the cytoplasm in <i>tor1</i>𝛥<i>tor2</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> double mutant cells. We also demonstrate here that the efficiency of endocytic internalization or scission in all <i>tor</i> mutants was drastically decreased. In agreement with the Sjl2 mislocalization, we found that in <i>tor1</i>𝛥<i>tor2</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> double mutant cells, as well as other <i>tor</i> mutant cells, the overall PIP<sub>2</sub> level was dramatically increased. Finally, the cell wall chitin content in <i>tor2</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> and <i>tor1</i>𝛥<i>tor2</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup> mutant cells was also significantly increased. Taken together, both functional Tor proteins, Tor1 and Tor2, are essentially required for proper endocytic protein dynamics at the early stage of endocytosis.</p>

				<title>Short-term hypoxia/reoxygenation activates the angiogenic pathway in rat caudate putamen</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0363-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In response to hypoxia, tissues have to implement numerous mechanisms to enhance oxygen delivery, including the activation of angiogenesis. This work investigates the angiogenic response of the hypoxic caudate putamen after several recovery times.</p>
					<p>Adult <i>Wistar</i> rats were submitted to acute hypoxia and analysed after 0 h, 24 h and 5 days of reoxygenation. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alfa (HIF-1𝛼) and angiogenesis-related genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), adrenomedullin (ADM) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-𝛽1) was determined by both RT-PCR and ELISA. For vessel labelling, lectin location and expression were analysed using histochemical and image processing techniques (fractal dimension).</p>
					<p>Expression of <i>Hif-1</i>𝛼, <i>Vegf, Adm</i> and <i>Tgf</i>-𝛽
					<i>1</i> mRNA rose immediately after hypoxia and this increase persisted in some cases after 5 days post-hypoxia. While VEGF and TGF-𝛽1 protein levels increased parallel to mRNA expression, ADM remained unaltered. The quantification of the striatal vessel network showed a significant augmentation at 24 h of reoxygenation.</p>
					<p>These results reveal that not only short-term hypoxia, but also the subsequent reoxygenation period, up-regulate the angiogenic pathway in the rat caudate putamen as a neuroprotective mechanism to hypoxia that seeks to maintain a proper blood supply to the hypoxic tissue, thereby minimizing the adverse effects of oxygen deprivation.</p>

				<title>Physiological responses to acute experimental hypoxia in the air-breathing Indian catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (Linnaeus, 1758)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0373-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With an aim to study the mechanism of adaptation to acute hypoxic periods by hypoxia-tolerant catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>, the mass-specific metabolic rate (VO<sub>2</sub>) along with its hematological parameters, metabolic response and antioxidant enzyme activities were studied. During progressive hypoxia, <i>C. batrachus</i> was found to be an oxyconformer and showed a steady decline in its aquatic oxygen consumption rate. When <i>C. batrachus</i> was exposed for different periods at experimental hypoxia level (0.98&#177;0.1 mg/L, DO), hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations were increased, along with decrease in mean cellular hemoglobin concentration, which reflected a physiological adaptation to enhance oxygen transport capacity. Significant increase in serum glucose and lactate concentration as well as lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed. Antioxidant enzymes were found to operate independently of one another, while total glutathione concentration was unaffected in any of the tissues across treatments. These observations suggested that hypoxia resulted in the development of oxidative stress and <i>C. batrachus</i> was able to respond through increase in the oxygen carrying capacity, metabolic depression and efficient antioxidant defense system to survive periods of acute hypoxia.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial disease caused by the interplay of environmental risk factors with multiple predisposing genes. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of DNA repair efficiency and oxidative stress and antioxidant status in CAD patients. Malonaldehyde (MDA), which is an indicator of oxidative stress, and mean break per cell (b/c) values, which is an indicator of decreased DNA repair efficiency, were found to be significantly increased in patients compared to normal controls (𝑃 &#60; 0.05) whereas ascorbic acid and GSH were found to be lower among patients than the control group. It has been found that elevated oxidative stress decreased antioxidant level and decreased DNA repair efficiency can contribute to the development of CAD. This study also showed that high MDA, low ascorbic acid and GSH were significantly associated with high b/c value.</p>

				<title>Allometric scaling relationship between frequency of intestinal contraction and body size in rodents and rabbits</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0391-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study aimed to establish an allometric scaling relationship between the frequency of intestinal contractions and body mass of different mammalian species. The frequency of intestinal contractions of rabbit, guinea pig, rat and mouse were measured using an isolated organ system. The isolated rings were prepared from proximal segments of jejunums and the frequency of contractions was recorded by an isometric force procedure. The coefficients of the obtained allometric equation were ascertained by computation of least squares after logarithmic transformation of both body mass and frequency. Significant differences (𝑝 &#60;0.001) were shown in the frequency of contractions between different species. The highest frequency that corresponded to the mice was 57.7 min<sup>−1</sup> and the 95% confidence interval (CI) ranged from 45.4 to 70, while rabbits showed the lowest frequency (12.71 min<sup>−1</sup>, CI: 8.6–16.8). Logarithms of frequency were statistically proportional to logarithms of body mass (r=0.99; 𝑝 &#60; 0.001). The data fitted an equation 𝐹 = 18:51 𝐵<sup>-0.31</sup> and the 95% confidence interval of the exponent ranged from −0.30 to −0.32. The results of this study suggest that it is probably possible to extrapolate the intestinal contraction frequency of other mammalian species by the means of allometry scaling.</p>

				<title>A simple and reliable methodology to detect egg white in art samples</title>

				<page>0397-0408</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A protocol for a simple and reliable dot-blot immunoassay was developed and optimized to test work of art samples for the presence of specific proteinaceus material (i.e. ovalbumin-based). The analytical protocol has been extensively set up with respect, among the other, to protein extraction conditions, to densitometric analysis and to the colorimetric reaction conditions. Feasibility evaluation demonstrated that a commercial scanner and a free image analysis software can be used for the data acquisition and elaboration, thus facilitating the application of the proposed protocol to commonly equipped laboratories and to laboratories of museums and conservation centres. The introduction of method of standard additions in the analysis of fresh and artificially aged laboratory-prepared samples, containing egg white and various pigments, allowed us to evaluate the matrix effect and the effect of sample aging and to generate threshold density values useful for the detection of ovalbumin in samples from ancient works of art. The efficacy of the developed dot-blot immunoassay was proved testing microsamples from 13th–16th century mural paintings of Saint Francesco Church in Lodi (Italy). Despite the aging, the altered conditions of conservation, the complex matrix, and the micro-size of samples, the presence of ovalbumin was detected in all those mural painting samples where mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis unambiguously detected ovalbumin peptides.</p>

				<title>UV-screening of grasses by plant silica layer?</title>
				<feature>Mini-reviews</feature>
				<page>0413-0416</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>UV-screening by terrestrial plants is a crucial trait since colonization of terrestrial environments has started. In general, it is enabled by phenolic substances. Especially for grasses it remains unclear why plants grown under the absence of UV-B-radiation exhibit nonetheless a high UV-B-screening potential. But this may be explained by the UV-screening effect of the silicon double layer. It was shown for seedlings of soybeans (<i>Glycine max</i> L.) and wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) that enhanced silicon supply reduces stress induced by UV-radiation. Even more important is a direct correlation between silicon content in the epidermis near area (intercellular spaces) and the absorption of UV-radiation in this area shown in other papers. The silicon double layer may act like a glass layer and decreases the transmission of UV-radiation at the epidermis near area. In summary, the absorbance/reflection of ultraviolet radiation is dependent on the characteristics of the epidermis near area of leaves, particularly the occurrence (qualitatively and quantitatively) of phenolic substances and/or a silicon double layer in this area. Consequently, UV-screening by plant silicon double layer should get more attention in future research with emphasis on effects of UV-radiation on plant physiology.</p>

				<title>The multiple faces of calcineurin signaling in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>: Development, behaviour and aging</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0417-0431</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Calcineurin, a well-conserved protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin–dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is known to be involved in a myriad of cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. The biological role of calcineurin has been extensively studied in diverse groups of organisms. Homologues of mammalian and <i>Drosophila</i> calcineurin subunits exist in the nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The <i>C. elegans</i> counterpart of the catalytic subunit, calcineurin A, <i>cna-1/tax-6</i>, and the regulatory subunit, calcineurin B, <i>cnb-1</i>, are known to express ubiquitously in multiple tissues including neurons. The characterization of <i>C. elegans</i> calcineurin mutants facilitates identification of its physiological functions and signaling pathways. Genetic interactions between <i>cna-1/tax-6</i> and <i>cnb-1</i> mutants with a number of mutants involved in several signaling pathways have exemplified the pivotal role of calcineurin in regulating nematode development, behaviour and lifespan (aging). The present review has been aimed to provide a succinct summary of the multiple functions of calcineurin in <i>C. elegans</i> relating to its development, fertility, proliferation, behaviour and lifespan. Analyses of <i>cna-1/tax-6</i> and <i>cnb-1</i> interacting proteins and regulators of the phosphatase in this fascinating worm model have an immense scope to identify potential drug targets in various parasitic nematodes, which cause many diseases inflicting huge economic loss; and also for many human diseases, particularly neurodegenerative and myocardial diseases.</p>

				<title>Plant innate immunity: An updated insight into defense mechanism </title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0433-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plants are invaded by an array of pathogens of which only a few succeed in causing disease. The attack by others is countered by a sophisticated immune system possessed by the plants. The plant immune system is broadly divided into two, viz. microbial-associated molecular-patterns-triggered immunity (MTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). MTI confers basal resistance, while ETI confers durable resistance, often resulting in hypersensitive response. Plants also possess systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which provides long-term defense against a broad-spectrum of pathogens. Salicylic-acid-mediated systemic acquired immunity provokes the defense response throughout the plant system during pathogen infection at a particular site. Trans-generational immune priming allows the plant to heritably shield their progeny towards pathogens previously encountered. Plants circumvent the viral infection through RNA interference phenomena by utilizing small RNAs. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of plant immune system, and the latest breakthroughs reported in plant defense. We discuss the plant–pathogen interactions and integrated defense responses in the context of presenting an integral understanding in plant molecular immunity.</p>

					<p>Sexually dimorphic characters have two-fold complexities in pattern formation as they have to get input fromboth somatic sex determination as well as the positional determining regulators.

Our results in this study indicate that male-like pattern of SCR expression is independent of <i>dsx</i> function, and <i>dsx</i><sup><i>F</i></sup> must be responsible for bringing about dimorphism in SCR expression, whereas <i>dsx</i><sup><i>M</i></sup> function is required with <i>Scr</i> for the morphogenesis of sex comb.</p>

				<title>Effect of zinc and calcium ions on the rat kidney membrane-bound form of dipeptidyl peptidase IV</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0461-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is an ectopeptidase with many roles, and a target of therapies for different pathologies. Zinc and calcium produce mixed inhibition of porcine DPP-IV activity. To investigate whether these results may be generalized to mammalian DPP-IV orthologues, we purified the intact membrane-bound form from rat kidney. Rat DPP-IV hydrolysed Gly-Pro-𝑝-nitroanilide with an average V<sub>max</sub> of 0.86&#177;0.01 𝜇mol min<sup>–1</sup>mL<sup>–1</sup> and K<sub>M</sub> of 76&#177;6 𝜇M. The enzyme was inhibited by the DPP-IV family inhibitor L-threo-Ile-thiazolidide (K<sub>i</sub>=64.0&#177;0.53 nM), competitively inhibited by bacitracin (K<sub>i</sub>=0.16&#177;0.01 mM) and bestatin (K<sub>i</sub>=0.23&#177;0.02 mM), and irreversibly inhibited by TLCK (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.20&#177;0.11 mM). The enzyme was also inhibited by divalent ions like Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, for which a mixed inhibition mechanism was observed (K<sub>i</sub> values of the competitive component: 0.15&#177;0.01 mM and 50.0&#177;1.05 mM, respectively). According to bioinformatic tools, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions preferentially bound to the 𝛽-propeller domain of the rat and human enzymes, while Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions to the 𝛼-𝛽 hydrolase domain; the binding sites were essentially the same that were previously reported for the porcine DPP-IV. These data suggest that the cationic susceptibility of mammalian DPP-IV orthologues involves conserved mechanisms.</p>

				<title>Fluorescent tag is not a reliable marker for small RNA transfection in the presence of serum</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0471-0478</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemically synthetic siRNA and miRNA have become powerful tools to study gene function in the past decade. Fluorescent dyes covalently attached to the 5&#8242; or 3&#8242; ends of synthetic small RNAs are widely used for fluorescently imaging and detection of these RNAs. However, the reliability of fluorescent tags as small RNA markers in different conditions has not attracted enough attention. We used Cy3-labelled small RNAs to explore the reliability of fluorescent tags as small RNA markers in cell cultures involving serum. A strong Cy3-fluorescence signal was observed in the cytoplasm of the cells transfected with Cy3-miR24 in the culture medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), but qRT-PCR results showed that little miR24 were detected in these cells. Further study demonstrated that small RNAs were degraded in the presence of FBS, suggesting that it was Cy3-RNA fragments, rather than the original Cy3-miR24, diffused into cells. These phenomena disappeared when FBS was replaced by boiled-FBS, further supporting that the Cy3-fluorescence we observed in cells in the presence of FBS could not represent the presence of intact small RNAs. These findings addressed that fluorescent tags are not reliable for small RNA transfection in the presence of serum in culture.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0479-0485</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs, 19–23 nucleotides in length, which regulate a variety of cellular processes. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes only one intronic miRNA: human cytomegalovirus microRNA UL36 (hcmv-miR-UL36). In this study, we found that over-expression of hcmv-miR-UL36 resulted in a more than threefold increase in HCMV DNA synthesis at 24 h post infection. Fifteen putative targets of hcmv-miR-UL36 were identified using hybrid PCR, one being the HCMV UL138 gene that has previously been identified as a novel latency-associated determinant of HCMV infection. Down-regulation of UL138 expression by hcmv-miR-UL36 was validated using luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis in HEK293 cells. In the presence of hcmv-miR-UL36, we observed a 74.6% decrease in luciferase activity and a 46.2% decrease in HCMV UL138 protein expression. Our results indicate that hcmv-miR-UL36 may be a viral miRNA contributing to HCMV replication.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0487-0497</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bacterial genome segregation and cell division has been studied mostly in bacteria harbouring single circular chromosome and low-copy plasmids. <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>, a radiation-resistant bacterium, harbours multipartite genome system. Chromosome I encodes majority of the functions required for normal growth while other replicons encode mostly the proteins involved in secondary functions. Here, we report the characterization of putative P-loop ATPase (ParA2) encoded on chromosome II of <i>D. radiodurans</i>. Recombinant ParA2 was found to be a DNA-binding ATPase. <i>E. coli</i> cells expressing ParA2 showed cell division inhibition and mislocalization of FtsZ-YFP and those expressing ParA2-CFP showed multiple CFP foci formation on the nucleoid. Although, <i>in trans</i> expression of ParA2 failed to complement SlmA loss <i>per se</i>, it could induce unequal cell division in <i>slmAmin</i>CDE double mutant. These results suggested that ParA2 is a nucleoid-binding protein, which could inhibits cell division in <i>E. coli</i> by affecting the correct localization of FtsZ and thereby cytokinesis. Helping <i>slmAmin</i>CDE mutant to produce minicells, a phenotype associated with mutations in the `Min’ proteins, further indicated the possibility of ParA2 regulating cell division by bringing nucleoid compaction at the vicinity of septum growth.</p>

				<page>0499-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium isolates produce type 1 fimbriae and exhibit fimbrial phase variation <i>in vitro</i>. Static broth culture favours the production of fimbriae, while solid agar medium inhibits the generation of these appendages. Little information is available regarding whether 𝑆. Typhimurium continues to produce type 1 fimbriae during <i>in vivo</i> growth. We used a type 1 fimbrial phase-variable strain 𝑆. Typhimurium LB5010 and its derivatives to infect RAW 264.7 macrophages. Following entry into macrophages, 𝑆. Typhimurium LB5010 gradually decreased the transcript levels of fimbrial subunit gene <i>fimA</i>, positive regulatory gene <i>fimZ</i>, and global regulatory gene <i>lrp</i>. A similar decrease in transcript levels was detected by RT-PCRwhen the pH of static brothmediumwas shifted frompH 7 to amore acidic pH 4. A <i>fimA</i>-deleted strain continued to multiply within macrophages as did the parental strain. An <i>lrp</i> deletion strain was unimpaired for <i>in vitro</i> growth at pH 7 or pH 4, while a strain harboring an <i>lrp</i>-containing plasmid exhibited impaired <i>in vitro</i> growth at pH 4. We propose that acidic medium, which resembles one aspect of the intracellular environment in a macrophage, inhibits type 1 fimbrial production by down-regulation of the expression of <i>lrp, fimZ</i> and <i>fimA</i>.</p>

				<title>A functional connection of Dictyostelium paracaspase with the contractile vacuole and a possible partner of the vacuolar proton ATPase</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0509-0521</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> possesses only one caspase family member, paracaspase (<i>pcp</i>). Two separate mutant cell lines were first analysed: one cell line was an over-expressed GFP-tagged Pcp (GFP-Pcp), while the other cell line was a <i>pcp</i>-null (<i>pcp</i>-). Microscopic analysis of cells expressing GFP-Pcp revealed that Pcp was associated with the contractile vacuole membrane consisting of bladder-like vacuoles. This association was disrupted when cells were exposed to osmotic stress conditions. Compared with wild-type cells, the GFP-Pcp-over-expressing cells were susceptible to osmotic stress and were seen to be very rounded in hypo-osmotic conditions and contained more abnormally swollen contractile vacuole. Cells with <i>pcp</i>- were also rounded but had few, if any, contractile vacuoles. These observations suggest that Pcp is essential for <i>Dictyostelium</i> osmotic regulation via its functioning in the contractile vacuole system. Subjecting these cells to selected contractile vacuole inhibitor provided additional support for these findings. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid system identified vacuolar proton ATPase (VatM) as the protein interacting with Pcp. Taken together, this work gives evidence for an eukaryotic paracaspase to be associated with both localization in and regulation of the contractile vacuolar system, an organelle critical for maintaining the normal morphology of the cell.</p>

				<title>MiR-200a enhances the migrations of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells by regulating the expression of TSPAN1</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0523-0532</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MicroRNA-200a (miR-200a) has been reported to regulate tumour progression in several tumours; however, little is known about its role in non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs). Here, we found that miR-200a was up-regulated in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells compared with normal lung cells HELF. By a series of gain-of-function and loss-offunction studies, over-expression of miR-200a was indicated to enhance cells migration, and its knock-down inhibited migration of cells in NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, miR-200a was identified to induce TSPAN1 expression which was related to migration. TSPAN1 was proved to induce migration, and so up-regulation of TSPAN1 by miR-200a may explain why over-expressing miR-200a promotes NSCLC cells migration.</p>

				<title>NOD1 and NOD2 receptors in mrigal (<i>Cirrhinus mrigala</i>): Inductive expression and downstream signalling in ligand stimulation and bacterial infections</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0533-0548</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)1 and NOD2 are important cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and key members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. They sense a wide range of bacteria or their products and play a key role in inducing innate immunity. This report describes the role of NOD1 and NOD2 receptors signalling in innate immunity in the Indian major carp, mrigal (<i>Cirrhinus mrigala</i>). Tissue-specific expression analysis of NOD1 and NOD2 genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed their wide distribution in various organs/tissues. In the untreated fish, the highest expression of NOD1 and NOD2 was detected in liver and blood, respectively. Stimulation with NOD1- and NOD2-specific ligands, i.e. iE-DAP and MDP, activated NOD1 and NOD2 receptor signalling <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> resulting in significant (𝑝 &#60; 0.05) induction of downstream signalling molecule RICK, and the effector molecules IL-1𝛽, IL-8 and IFN-𝛾 in the treated group as compared to their controls. In response to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections, NOD1 and NOD2 receptors signalling were activated and IL-1𝛽, IL-8 and IFN-𝛾 were induced. These findings highlight the important role of NOD receptors in eliciting innate immune response during the pathogenic invasion to the fish.</p>

				<title><i>Rhodnius prolixus</i> and <i>Rhodnius robustus</i> - like (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) wing asymmetry under controlled conditions of population density and feeding frequency</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0549-0560</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Habitat change in <i>Rhodnius</i> spp may represent an environmental challenge for the development of the species, particularly when feeding frequency and population density vary in nature. To estimate the effect of these variables in stability on development, the degree of directional asymmetry (DA) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the wing size and shape of <i>R. prolixus</i> and <i>R. robustus</i>–like were measured under laboratory controlled conditions. DA and FA in wing size and shape were significant in both species, but their variation patterns showed both inter-specific and sexual dimorphic differences in FA of wing size and shape induced by nutrition stress. These results suggest different abilities of the genotypes and sexes of two sylvatic and domestic genotypes of <i>Rhodnius</i> to buffer these stress conditions. However, both species showed non-significant differences in the levels of FA between treatments that simulated sylvan vs domestic conditions, indicating that the developmental noise did not explain the variation in wing size and shape found in previous studies. Thus, this result confirm that the variation in wing size and shape in response to treatments constitute a plastic response of these genotypes to population density and feeding frequency.</p>

				<title>Repeated oral administration of capsaicin increases anxiety-like behaviours with prolonged stress-response in rats</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0561-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study was conducted to examine the psycho-emotional effects of repeated oral exposure to capsaicin, the principal active component of chili peppers. Each rat received 1 mL of 0.02% capsaicin into its oral cavity daily, and was subjected to behavioural tests following 10 daily administrations of capsaicin. Stereotypy counts and rostral grooming were significantly increased, and caudal grooming decreased, in capsaicin-treated rats during the ambulatory activity test. In elevated plus maze test, not only the time spent in open arms but also the percent arm entry into open arms was reduced in capsaicin-treated rats compared with control rats. In forced swim test, although swimming duration was decreased, struggling increased in the capsaicin group, immobility duration did not differ between the groups. Repeated oral capsaicin did not affect the basal levels of plasma corticosterone; however, the stress-induced elevation of plasma corticosterone was prolonged in capsaicin treated rats. Oral capsaicin exposure significantly increased c-Fos expression not only in the nucleus tractus of solitarius but also in the paraventricular nucleus. Results suggest that repeated oral exposure to capsaicin increases anxiety-like behaviours in rats, and dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may play a role in its pathophysiology.</p>

				<title>Production of marker-free and RSV-resistant transgenic rice using a twin T-DNA system and RNAi</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0573-0581</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A twin T-DNA system is a convenient strategy for creating selectable marker-free transgenic plants. The standard transformation plasmid, pCAMBIA 1300, was modified into a binary vector consisting of two separate T-DNAs, one of which contained the hygromycin phosphotransferase (<i>hpt</i>) marker gene. Using this binary vector, we constructed two vectors that expressed inverted-repeat (IR) structures targeting the rice stripe virus (RSV) coat protein (CP) gene and the special-disease protein (SP) gene. Transgenic rice lines were obtained via <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. Seven independent clones harbouring both the <i>hpt</i> marker gene and the target genes (RSV CP or SP) were obtained in the primary transformants of pDTRSVCP and pDTRSVSP, respectively. The segregation frequencies of the target gene and the marker gene in the T<sub>1</sub> plants were 8.72% for pDTRSVCP and 12.33% for pDTRSVSP. Two of the pDTRSVCP lines and three pDTRSVSP lines harbouring the homozygous target gene, but not the <i>hpt</i> gene, were strongly resistant to RSV. A molecular analysis of the resistant transgenic plants confirmed the stable integration and expression of the target genes. The resistant transgenic plants displayed lower levels of the transgene transcripts and specific small interfering RNAs, suggesting that RNAi induced the viral resistance.</p>

				<title>Down-regulation of OsSAG12-1 results in enhanced senescence and pathogen-induced cell death in transgenic rice plants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0583-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Senescence is a highly regulated process accompanied by changes in gene expression. While the mRNA levels of most genes decline, the mRNA levels of specific genes (senescence associated genes, SAGs) increase during senescence. <i>Arabidopsis SAG12</i> (<i>AtSAG12</i>) gene codes for papain-like cysteine protease. The promoter of <i>AtSAG12</i> is SA-responsive and reported to be useful to delay senescence by expressing cytokinin biosynthesis gene isopentenyltransferase specifically during senescence in several plants including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, lettuce and rice. The physiological role of <i>AtSAG12</i> is not known; the homozygous <i>atsag12</i> mutant neither fails to develop senescence-associated vacuoles nor shows any morphological phenotype. Through BLAST search using AtSAG12 amino acid sequences as query, we identified a few putative homologues from rice genome (OsSAGs; <i>Oryza sativa</i> SAGs). <i>OsSAG12-1</i> is the closest homologue of AtSAG12 with 64% similar amino acid composition. Expression of <i>OsSAG12-1</i> is induced during senescence and pathogen-induced cell death. To evaluate the possible role of <i>OsSAG12-1</i> we generated RNAi transgenic lines in Japonica rice cultivar TP309. The transgenic lines developed early senescence at varying levels and showed enhanced cell death when inoculated with bacterial pathogen <i>Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae</i>. Our results suggest that OsSAG12-1 is a negative regulator of cell death in rice.</p>

				<title>Functional analyses of a flavonol synthase - like gene from <i>Camellia nitidissima</i> reveal its roles in flavonoid metabolism during floral pigmentation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0593-0604</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The flavonoids metabolic pathway plays central roles in floral coloration, in which anthocyanins and flavonols are derived from common precursors, dihydroflavonols. Flavonol synthase (FLS) catalyses dihydroflavonols into flavonols, which presents a key branch of anthocyanins biosynthesis. The yellow flower of <i>Camellia nitidissima</i> Chi. is a unique feature within the genus <i>Camellia</i>, which makes it a precious resource for breeding yellow camellia varieties. In this work, we characterized the secondary metabolites of pigments during floral development of <i>C. nitidissima</i> and revealed that accumulation of flavonols correlates with floral coloration. We first isolated <i>CnFLS1</i> and showed that it is a FLS of <i>C. nitidissima</i> by gene family analysis. Second, expression analysis during floral development and different floral organs indicated that the expression level of <i>CnFLS1</i> was regulated by developmental cues, which was in agreement with the accumulating pattern of flavonols. Furthermore, over-expression of <i>CnFLS1</i> in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> altered floral colour into white or light yellow, and metabolic analysis showed significant increasing of flavonols and reducing of anthocyanins in transgenic plants. Our work suggested <i>CnFLS1</i> plays critical roles in yellow colour pigmentation and is potentially a key point of genetic engineering toward colour modification in <i>Camellia</i>.</p>

				<title>Role of sound stimulation in reprogramming brain connectivity</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0605-0614</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sensory stimulation has a critical role to play in the development of an individual. Environmental factors tend to modify the inputs received by the sensory pathway. The developing brain is most vulnerable to these alterations and interacts with the environment to modify its neural circuitry. In addition to other sensory stimuli, auditory stimulation can also act as external stimuli to provide enrichment during the perinatal period. There is evidence that suggests that enriched environment in the form of auditory stimulation can play a substantial role in modulating plasticity during the prenatal period. This review focuses on the emerging role of prenatal auditory stimulation in the development of higher brain functions such as learning and memory in birds and mammals. The molecular mechanisms of various changes in the hippocampus following sound stimulation to effect neurogenesis, learning and memory are described. Sound stimulation can also modify neural connectivity in the early postnatal life to enhance higher cognitive function or even repair the secondary damages in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, it becomes imperative to examine in detail the possible ameliorating effects of prenatal sound stimulation in existing animal models of various psychiatric disorders, such as autism.</p>

				<title>mRNA quality control pathways in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i></title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0615-0640</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Efficient production of translation-competent mRNAs involves processing and modification events both in the nucleus and cytoplasm which require a number of complex machineries at both co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Mutations in the genomic sequence sometimes result in the formation of mutant non-functional defective messages. In addition, the enormous amounts of complexities involved in the biogenesis of mRNPs in the nucleus very often leads to the formation of aberrant and faulty messages along with their functional counterpart. Subsequent translation of these mutant and defective populations of messenger RNAs could possibly result in the unfaithful transmission of genetic information and thus is considered a threat to the survival of the cell. To prevent this possibility, mRNA quality control systems have evolved both in the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotes to scrutinize various stages of mRNP biogenesis and translation. In this review, we will focus on the physiological role of some of these mRNA quality control systems in the simplest model eukaryote <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.</p>

				<page>0641-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stem cell research holds a promise to treat and prevent age-related degenerative changes in humans. Literature is replete with studies showing that stem cell function declines with aging, especially in highly proliferative tissues/organs. Among others, telomerase and telomere damage is one of the intrinsic physical instigators that drive agerelated degenerative changes. In this review we provide brief overview of telomerase-deficient aging affects in diverse stem cells populations. Furthermore, potential disease phenotypes associated with telomerase dysregulation in a specific stem cell population is also discussed in this review. Additionally, the role of telomerase in stem cell driven cancer is also briefly touched upon.</p>

				<title>The aging of the 2000 and 2011 Hallmarks of Cancer reviews: A critique</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0651-0663</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two review articles published in 2000 and 2011 by Hanahan and Weinberg have dominated the discourse about carcinogenesis among researchers in the recent past. The basic tenets of their arguments favour considering cancer as a cell-based, genetic disease whereby DNA mutations cause uncontrolled cell proliferation. Their explanation of cancer phenotypes is based on the premises adopted by the somatic mutation theory (SMT) and its cell-centered variants. From their perspective, eight broad features have been identified as so-called ‘Hallmarks of Cancer’. Here, we criticize the value of these features based on the numerous intrinsic inconsistencies in the data and in the rationale behind SMT. An alternative interpretation of the same data plus data mostly ignored by Hanahan and Weinberg is proposed, based instead on evolutionarily relevant premises. From such a perspective, cancer is viewed as a tissue-based disease. This alternative, called the tissue organization field theory, incorporates the premise that <i>proliferation</i> and <i>motility</i> are the default state of <i>all</i> cells, and that carcinogenesis is due to alterations on the reciprocal interactions among cells and between cells and their extracellular matrix. In this view, cancer is development gone awry.</p>

				<title><i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> in Egypt: Past, present and future</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0665-0672</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The African species of <i>Biomphalaria</i> appeared as a result of the relatively recent west-to-east trans-Atlantic dispersal of the <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i>-like taxon. In Egypt, <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> is the intermediate host for <i>Schistosoma mansoni. Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> originated in the area between Alexandria and Rosetta and has historically been confined to the Nile Delta. <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> reached Egypt via infected slaves and baboons from the Land of Punt through migrations that occurred as early as the Vth Dynasty. The suggestion of the presence of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> infection in Lower Egypt during Pharaonic times is discussed despite the fact that that there is no evidence of such infection in Egyptian mummies. It is only recently that <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> colonized the Egyptian Nile from the Delta to Lake Nasser. This change was likely due to the construction of huge water projects, the development of new water resources essential for land reclamation projects and the movement of refugees from the Suez Canal zone to the Delta and vice versa. The situation with respect to <i>Biomphalaria</i> in Egypt has become complicated in recent years by the detection of <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i> and a hybrid between both species; however, follow-up studies have demonstrated the disappearance of such species within Egypt. The National Schistosoma Control Program has made great strides with respect to the eradication of schistosoma; however, there has unfortunately been a reemergence of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> resistant to praziquantel. There are numerous factors that may influence the prevalence of snails in Egypt, including the construction of water projects, the increase in reclaimed areas, global climate change and pollution. Thus, continued field studies in addition to the cooperation of several scientists are needed to obtain an accurate representation of the status of this species. In addition, the determination of the genome sequence for <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> and the use of modern technology will allow for the study of the host–parasite relationship at a molecular level.</p>

				<page>0685-0693</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Actinorhizal plants have been found in eight genera belonging to three orders (Fagales, Rosales and Cucurbitales). These all bear root nodules inhabited by bacteria identified as the nitrogen-fixing actinobacterium <i>Frankia</i>. These nodules all have a peripheral cortex with enlarged cells filled with <i>Frankia</i> hyphae and vesicles. Isolation in pure culture has been notoriously difficult, due in a large part to the growth of fast-growing contaminants where, it was later found, <i>Frankia</i> was slow-growing.</p>
					<p>Many of these contaminants, which were later found to be <i>Micromonospora</i>, were obtained from <i>Casuarina</i> and <i>Coriaria</i>. Our study was aimed at determining if <i>Micromonospora</i> were also present in other actinorhizal plants. Nodules from <i>Alnus glutinosa, Alnus viridis, Coriaria myrtifolia, Elaeagnus x ebbingei, Hippophae rhamnoides, Myrica gale</i> and <i>Morella pensylvanica</i> were tested and were all found to contain <i>Micromonospora</i> isolates. These were found to belong to mainly three species: <i>Micromonospora lupini, Micromonospora coriariae</i> and <i>Micromonospora saelicesensis</i>.</p>
					<p><i>Micromonospora</i> isolates were found to inhibit some <i>Frankia</i> strains and to be innocuous to other strains.</p>

					<p>The occurrence of uncultivated <i>Frankia</i> was evaluated in Tunisian soils by a plant-trapping assay using <i>Coriaria myrtifolia</i> seedlings. Despite the lack of this compatible host plant for more than two centuries, soil-borne <i>Frankia</i> cells were detected in one sampled soil as shown by the development of root nodules on 2-year-old seedlings. Based on <i>glnA</i> sequences, Tunisian trapped <i>Frankia</i> strains belong to the uncultivated cluster 2 strains that associate with other <i>Coriaria</i> species and also with <i>Ceanothus, Datisca</i> and Rosaceae actinorhizal species.

				<title>Structural and gene expression analyses of uptake hydrogenases and other proteins involved in nitrogenase protection in <i>Frankia</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0703-0712</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The actinorhizal bacterium <i>Frankia</i> expresses nitrogenase and can therefore convert molecular nitrogen into ammonia and the by-product hydrogen. However, nitrogenase is inhibited by oxygen. Consequently, <i>Frankia</i> and its actinorhizal hosts have developed various mechanisms for excluding oxygen from their nitrogen-containing compartments. These include the expression of oxygen-scavenging uptake hydrogenases, the formation of hopanoid-rich vesicles, enclosed by multi-layered hopanoid structures, the lignification of hyphal cell walls, and the production of haemoglobins in the symbiotic nodule. In this work, we analysed the expression and structure of the so-called uptake hydrogenase (Hup), which catalyses the <i>in vivo</i> dissociation of hydrogen to recycle the energy locked up in this ‘waste’ product. Two uptake hydrogenase syntons have been identified in <i>Frankia</i>: synton 1 is expressed under free-living conditions while synton 2 is expressed during symbiosis. We used qPCR to determine synton 1 <i>hup</i> gene expression in two <i>Frankia</i> strains under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We also predicted the 3D structures of the Hup protein subunits based on multiple sequence alignments and remote homology modelling. Finally, we performed BLAST searches of genome and protein databases to identify genes that may contribute to the protection of nitrogenase against oxygen in the two <i>Frankia</i> strains. Our results show that in <i>Frankia</i> strain ACN14a, the expression patterns of the large (HupL1) and small (HupS1) uptake hydrogenase subunits depend on the abundance of oxygen in the external environment. Structural models of the membrane-bound hydrogenase subunits of ACN14a showed that both subunits resemble the structures of known [NiFe] hydrogenases (Volbeda <i>et al.</i> 1995), but contain fewer cysteine residues than the uptake hydrogenase of the <i>Frankia</i> DC12 and Eu1c strains. Moreover, we show that all of the investigated <i>Frankia</i> strains have two squalene hopane cyclase genes (<i>shc1</i> and <i>shc2</i>). The only exceptions were CcI3 and the symbiont of <i>Datisca</i> glomerata, which possess <i>shc1</i> but not <i>shc2</i>. Four truncated haemoglobin genes were identified in <i>Frankia</i> ACN14a and Eu1f, three in CcI3, two in EANpec1 and one in the <i>Datisca glomerata</i> symbiont (Dg).</p>

				<title>Codon-optimized antibiotic resistance gene improves efficiency of transient transformation in <i>Frankia</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0713-0717</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Frankia</i> is a unique actinobacterium having abilities to fix atmospheric dinitrogen and to establish endosymbiosis with trees, but molecular bases underlying these interesting characteristics are poorly understood because of a lack of stable transformation system. Extremely high GC content of <i>Frankia</i> genome (&#62; 70%) can be a hindrance to successful transformation. We generated a synthetic gentamicin resistance gene whose codon usage is optimized to <i>Frankia</i> (<i>fgm</i><sup><i>R</i></sup>) and evaluated its usefulness as a selection marker using a transient transformation system. Success rate of transient transformation and cell growth in selective culture were significantly increased by use of <i>fgm</i><sup><i>R</i></sup> instead of a native gentamicin resistance gene, suggesting that codon optimization improved translation efficiency of the marker gene and increased antibiotic resistance. Our result shows that similarity in codon usage pattern is an important factor to be taken into account when exogenous transgenes are expressed in <i>Frankia</i> cells.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Among the Actinobacteria, the genus <i>Frankia</i> is well known for its facultative lifestyle as a plant symbiont of dicotyledonous plants and as a free-living soil dweller. <i>Frankia</i> sp. strains are generally classified into one of four major phylogenetic groups that have distinctive plant host ranges. Our understanding of these bacteria has been greatly facilitated by the availability of the first three complete genome sequences, which suggested a correlation between genome size and plant host range. Since that first report, eight more <i>Frankia</i> genomes have been sequenced. Representatives from all four lineages have been sequenced to provide vital baseline information for genomic approaches toward understanding these novel bacteria. An overview of the <i>Frankia</i> genomes will be presented to stimulate discussion on the potential of these organisms and a greater understanding of their physiology and evolution.</p>

					<p>Pseudogenes are defined as non-functional relatives of genes whose protein-coding abilities are lost and are no longer expressed within cells. They are an outcome of accumulation of mutations within a gene whose end product is not essential for survival. Proper investigation of the procedure of pseudogenization is relevant for estimating occurrence of duplications in genomes. Frankineae houses an interesting group of microorganisms, carving a niche in the microbial world. This study was undertaken with the objective of determining the abundance of pseudogenes, understanding strength of purifying selection, investigating evidence of pseudogene expression, and analysing their molecular nature, their origin, evolution and deterioration patterns amongst domain families. Investigation revealed the occurrence of 956 core pFAM families sharing common characteristics indicating co-evolution. WD40, Rve_3, DDE_Tnp_IS240 and phage integrase core domains are larger families, having more pseudogenes, signifying a probability of harmful foreign genes being disabled within transposable elements. High selective pressure depicted that gene families rapidly duplicating and evolving undoubtedly facilitated creation of a number of pseudogenes in Frankineae. Codon usage analysis between protein-coding genes and pseudogenes indicated a wide degree of variation with respect to different factors. Moreover, the majority of pseudogenes were under the effect of purifying selection. Frankineae pseudogenes were under stronger selective constraints, indicating that they were functional for a very long time and became pseudogenes abruptly. The origin and deterioration of pseudogenes has been attributed to selection and mutational pressure acting upon sequences for adapting to stressed soil environments.</p>

				<title>Functional divergence outlines the evolution of novel protein function in NifH/BchL protein family</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0733-0740</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biological nitrogen fixation is accomplished by prokaryotes through the catalytic action of complex metalloenzyme, nitrogenase. Nitrogenase is a two-protein component system comprising MoFe protein (NifD&amp;K) and Fe protein (NifH). NifH shares structural and mechanistic similarities as well as evolutionary relationships with light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase (BchL), a photosynthesis-related metalloenzyme belonging to the same protein family. We performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the NifH/BchL family in order to elucidate the intrinsic functional diversity and the underlying evolutionary mechanism among the members. To analyse functional divergence in the NifH/BchL family, we have conducted pair-wise estimation in altered evolutionary rates between the member proteins. We identified a number of vital amino acid sites which contribute to predicted functional diversity.We have also made use of the maximum likelihood tests for detection of positive selection at the amino acid level followed by the structure-based phylogenetic approach to draw conclusion on the ancient lineage and novel characterization of the NifH/BchL protein family. Our investigation provides ample support to the fact that NifH protein and BchL share robust structural similarities and have probably deviated from a common ancestor followed by divergence in functional properties possibly due to gene duplication.</p>

				<page>0741-0747</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i> Forst. is a tree crop that provides fuel wood, land reclamation, dune stabilization, and scaffolding for construction, shelter belts, and pulp and paper production. <i>C. equisetifolia</i> fixes atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with <i>Frankia</i>, a soil bacterium of the actinobacteria group. The roots of <i>C. equisetifolia</i> produce root nodules where the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen, which is an essential nutrient for all plant metabolic activities. However, rooted stem cuttings of elite clones of <i>C. equisetifolia</i> by vegetative propagation is being planted by the farmers of Pondicherry as costeffective method. As the vegetative propagation method uses inert material (vermiculite) for rooting there is no chance for <i>Frankia</i> association. Therefore after planting of these stocks the farmers are applying 150 kg of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)/acre/year. To overcome this fertilizer usage, the <i>Frankia</i>-inoculated rooted stem cuttings were propagated under nursery conditions and transplanted in the nutrient-deficient soils of Karaikal, Pondicherry (India), in this study. Under nursery experiments the growth and biomass of <i>C. equisetifolia</i> rooted stem cuttings inoculated with <i>Frankia</i> showed 3 times higher growth and biomass than uninoculated control. These stocks were transplanted and monitored for their growth and survival for 1 year in the nutrient-deficient farm land. The results showed that the rooted stem cuttings of <i>C. equisetifolia</i> significantly improved growth in height (8.8 m), stem girth (9.6 cm) and tissue nitrogen content (3.3 mg g<sup>−1</sup>) than uninoculated controls. The soil nutrient status was also improved due to inoculation of <i>Frankia</i>.</p>

				<title>Indigenous actinorhizal plants of Australia</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0749-0759</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indigenous species of actinorhizal plants of Casuarinaceae, Elaeagnaceae and Rhamnaceae are found in specific regions of Australia. Most of these plants belong to Casuarinaceae, the dominant actinorhizal family in Australia. Many of them have significant environmental and economical value. The other two families with their indigenous actinorhizal plants have only a minor presence in Australia. Most Australian actinorhizal plants have their native range only in Australia, whereas two of these plants are also found indigenously elsewhere. The nitrogen-fixing ability of these plants varies between species. This ability needs to be investigated in some of these plants. Casuarinas form a distinctive but declining part of the Australian landscape. Their potential has rarely been applied in forestry in Australia despite their well-known uses, which are being judiciously exploited elsewhere. To remedy this oversight, a programme has been proposed for increasing and improving casuarinas that would aid in greening more regions of Australia, increasing the soil fertility and the area of wild life habitat (including endangered species). Whether these improved clones would be productive with local strains of Frankia or they need an external inoculum of <i>Frankia</i> should be determined and the influence of mycorrhizal fungi on these clones also should be investigated.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0761-0776</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To estimate the N<sub>2</sub> fixation ability of the alder (<i>Alnus hirsuta</i> (Turcz.) var. <i>sibirica</i>), we examined the seasonal variation in nitrogenase activity of nodules using the acetylene reduction method in an 18-year-old stand naturally regenerated after disturbance by road construction in Japan. To evaluate the contribution of N<sub>2</sub> fixation to the nitrogen (N) economy in this alder stand, we also measured the phenology of the alder, the litterfall, the decomposition rate of the leaf litter, and N accumulation in the soil. The acetylene reduction activity per unit nodule mass (ARA) under field conditions appeared after bud break, peaked the maximum in midsummer after full expansion of the leaves, and disappeared after all leaves had fallen. There was no consistent correlation between ARA and tree size (dbh). The amount of N<sub>2</sub> fixed in this alder stand was estimated at 56.4 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> when a theoretical molar ratio of 3 was used to convert the amount of reduced acetylene to the amount of fixed N<sub>2</sub>. This amount of N<sub>2</sub> fixation corresponded to the 66.4% of N in the leaf litter produced in a year. These results suggested that N<sub>2</sub> fixation still contributed to the large portion of N economy in this alder stand.</p>

				<title>Characterization of haemoglobin from Actinorhizal plants  -- An <i>in silico</i> approach</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0777-0787</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plant haemoglobins (Hbs), found in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants, are heme proteins and members of the globin superfamily. Hb genes of actinorhizal Fagales mostly belong to the non-symbiotic type of haemoglobin; however, along with the non-symbiotic Hb, <i>Casuarina</i> sp. posses a symbiotic one (symCgHb), which is expressed specifically in infected cells of nodules. A thorough sequence analysis of 26 plant Hb proteins, currently available in public domain, revealed a consensus motif of 29 amino acids. This motif is present in all the members of symbiotic class II Hbs including symCgHb and non-symbiotic Class II Hbs, but is totally absent in Class I symbiotic and non-symbiotic Hbs. Further, we constructed 3D structures of Hb proteins from <i>Alnus</i> and <i>Casuarina</i> through homology modelling and peeped into their structural properties. Structure-based studies revealed that the <i>Casuarina</i> symbiotic haemoglobin protein shows distinct stereochemical properties from that of the other <i>Casuarina</i> and <i>Alnus</i> Hb proteins. It also showed considerable structural similarities with leghemoglobin structure from yellow lupin (pdb id 1GDI). Therefore, sequence and structure analyses point to the fact that symCgHb protein shows significant resemblance to symbiotic haemoglobin found in legumes and may thus eventually play a similar role in shielding the nitrogenase from oxygen as seen in the case of leghemoglobin.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Trees of <i>Myrica</i> sp. grow abundantly in the forests of Meghalaya, India. These trees are actinorhizal and harbour nitrogen-fixing <i>Frankia</i> in their root nodules and contribute positively towards the enhancement of nitrogen status of forest areas. They can be used in rejuvenation of mine spoils and nitrogen-depleted fallow lands generated due to slash and burn agriculture practiced in the area. We have studied the association of amplicon restriction patterns (ARPs) of <i>Myrica</i> ribosomal RNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and nitrogenase activity of its root nodules. We found that ARPs thus obtained could be used as markers for early screening of seedlings that could support strains of <i>Frankia</i> that fix atmospheric nitrogen more efficiently.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of phytochemical constituents and antioxidant activity of selected actinorhizal fruits growing in the forests of Northeast India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0797-0803</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Hippophae salicifolia, Elaeagnus pyriformis, Myrica esculenta</i> and <i>M. nagi</i> are actinorhizal plants growing in the sacred forests of Northeast India with multipurpose uses. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the phenol, flavonoid and flavonol contents of the fresh fruit juice of these plant species including the antioxidant potential by means of DPPH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO scavenging activity and FRP. The total phenolic, flavonoid and flavonol contents of fruit juice ranged from 321.68&#177;0.06 to 76.67&#177;0.01 mg/g GAE, 272.92&#177;0.07 to 20.12&#177;0.02 mg/g QE and 258.92&#177;0.08 to 18.72&#177;0.02 mg/g QE, respectively. At 2.0 mg/mL concentration, DPPH scavenging activity was found to be the highest in <i>M. esculenta</i> (89.62%) and the lowest in <i>E. pyriformis</i> (17.58%). The reducing power activity was found significantly higher in <i>H. salicifolia</i> juice, which increased with increase in concentration. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging activity of <i>H. salicifolia</i> juice was found to be as high as 98.78%, while <i>Elaeagnus</i> juice was found to be less effective with just 48.90%. Juice of <i>H. salicifolia</i> showed the greatest NO scavenging effect of 75.24% as compared to juice of <i>E. pyriformis</i>, where only 37.54% scavenging was observed at the same concentration. Taking into account all the experimental data, it can be said that the fruits of <i>H. salicifolia</i> and both <i>M. nagi</i> and <i>M. esculenta</i> have good antioxidant activity compared to fruits of <i>E. pyriformis</i>.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0805-0814</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Type 2 diabetes is an inevitably progressive disease, with irreversible 𝛽 cell failure. Glycogen synthase kinase and Glukokinase, two important enzymes with diverse biological actions in carbohydrate metabolism, are promising targets for developing novel antidiabetic drugs. A combinatorial structure-based molecular docking and pharmacophore modelling study was performed with the compounds of <i>Hippophae salicifolia</i> and <i>H. rhamnoides</i> as inhibitors. Docking with Discovery Studio 3.5 revealed that two compounds from <i>H. salicifolia</i>, viz Lutein D and an analogue of Zeaxanthin, and two compounds from <i>H. rhamnoides</i>, viz Isorhamnetin-3-rhamnoside and Isorhamnetin-7-glucoside, bind significantly to the GSK-3 𝛽 receptor and play a role in its inhibition; whereas in the case of Glucokinase, only one compound from both the plants, i.e. vitamin C, had good binding characteristics capable of activation. The results help to understand the type of interactions that occur between the ligands and the receptors. Toxicity predictions revealed that none of the compounds had hepatotoxic effects and had good absorption as well as solubility characteristics. The compounds did not possess plasma protein-binding, crossing blood–brain barrier ability. Further, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies need to be performed to prove that these compounds can be used effectively as antidiabetic drugs.</p>

				<title><i>Casuarina glauca</i>: A model tree for basic research in actinorhizal symbiosis</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0815-0823</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Casuarina glauca</i> is a fast-growing multipurpose tree belonging to the <i>Casuarinaceae</i> family and native to Australia. It requires limited use of chemical fertilizers due to the symbiotic association with the nitrogen-fixing actinomycete <i>Frankia</i> and with mycorrhizal fungi, which help improve phosphorous and water uptake by the root system. <i>C. glauca</i> can grow in difficult sites, colonize eroded lands and improve their fertility, thereby enabling the subsequent growth of more demanding plant species. As a result, this tree is increasingly used for reforestation and reclamation of degraded lands in tropical and subtropical areas such as China and Egypt. Many tools have been developed in recent years to explore the molecular basis of the interaction between <i>Frankia</i> and <i>C. glauca</i>. These tools include <i>in vitro</i> culture of the host and genetic transformation with <i>Agrobacterium</i>, genome sequencing of <i>Frankia</i> and related studies, isolation of plant symbiotic genes combined with functional analyses (including knock-down expression based on RNA interference), and transcriptome analyses of roots inoculated with <i>Frankia</i> or <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i>. These efforts have been fruitful since recent results established that many common molecular mechanisms regulate the nodulation process in actinorhizal plants and legumes, thus providing new insights into the evolution of nitrogen-fixing symbioses.</p>

Since many predators orient their eyes towards prey while attacking, predator gaze and directness of approach could serve as conspicuous indicators of risk to prey. The ability to perceive these cues and discriminate between high and low predation risk should benefit prey species through both higher survival and decreased energy expenditure. We experimentally examined whether Indian rock lizards (<i>Psammophilus dorsalis</i>) can perceive these two indicators of predation risk by measuring the variation in their fleeing behaviour in response to type of gaze and approach by a human predator. Overall, we found that the gaze and approach of the predator influenced flight initiation distance, which also varied with attributes of the prey (i.e. size/sex and tail-raise behaviour). Flight initiation distance (FID) was 43% longer during direct approaches with direct gaze compared with tangential approaches with averted gaze. In further, exploratory, analyses, we found that FID was 23% shorter for adult male lizards than for female or young male (FYM) lizards. In addition, FYM lizards that showed a tail-raise display during approach had a 71% longer FID than those that did not. Our results suggest that multiple factors influence the decision to flee in animals. Further studies are needed to test the generality of these factors and to investigate the proximate mechanisms underlying flight decisions.</p>

				<title>Influence of clove oil on certain quorum-sensing-regulated functions and biofilm of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0835-0844</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quorum sensing (QS) plays an important role in virulence, biofilm formation and survival of many pathogenic bacteria including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. This signalling pathway is considered as novel and promising target for anti-infective agents. In the present investigation, effect of the Sub-MICs of clove oil on QS regulated virulence factors and biofilm formation was evaluated against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1 and <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> WAF-38 strain. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of the clove oil demonstrated statistically significant reduction of <i>las</i>- and <i>rhl</i>-regulated virulence factors such as LasB, total protease, chitinase and pyocyanin production, swimming motility and exopolysaccharide production. The biofilm forming capability of PAO1 and <i>A. hydrophila</i> WAF-38 was also reduced in a concentration-dependent manner at all tested sub-MIC values. Further, the PAO1-preinfected <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> displayed an enhanced survival when treated with 1.6% v/v of clove oil. The above findings highlight the promising anti-QS-dependent therapeutic function of clove oil against <i>P. aeruginosa</i>.</p>

				<title>Molecular flexibility of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> ribosome recycling factor and its functional consequences: An exploration involving mutants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0845-0855</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Internal mobility of the two domain molecule of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) is known to be important for its action. <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> RRF does not complement <i>E. coli</i> for its deficiency of RRF (in the presence of <i>E. coli</i> EF-G alone). Crystal structure had revealed higher rigidity of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> RRF due to the presence of additional salt bridges between domains. Two inter-domain salt bridges and one between the linker region and the domain containing C-terminal residues were disrupted by appropriate mutations. Except for a C-terminal deletion mutant, all mutants showed RRF activity in <i>E. coli</i> when <i>M. tuberculosis</i> EF-G was also co-expressed. The crystal structures of the point mutants, that of the C-terminal deletion mutant and that of the protein grown in the presence of a detergent, were determined. The increased mobility resulting from the disruption of the salt bridge involving the hinge region allows the appropriate mutant to weakly complement <i>E. coli</i> for its deficiency of RRF even in the absence of simultaneous expression of the mycobacterial EF-G. The loss of activity of the C-terminal deletion mutant appears to be partly due to the rigidification of the molecule consequent to changes in the hinge region.</p>

				<title>Realizing directional cloning using sticky ends produced by 3ʹ-5ʹ exonuclease of Klenow fragment</title>

				<page>0857-0866</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Klenow fragment (KF) has been used to make the blunt end as a tool enzyme. Its 5&#8242;-3&#8242; polymerase activity can extend the 5&#8242; overhanging sticky end to the blunt end, and 3&#8242;-5&#8242; exonuclease activity can cleave the 3&#8242; overhanging sticky end to the blunt end. The blunt end is useful for cloning. Here, we for the first time determined that a sticky end can be made by using the 3&#8242;-5&#8242; exonuclease activity of KF. We found that KF can cleave the blunt end into certain sticky ends under controlled conditions. We optimized enzyme cleavage conditions, and characterized the cleaved sticky ends to be mainly 2 nt 5&#8242; overhang. By using these sticky ends, we realized ligation reaction <i>in vitro</i>, and accomplished cloning short oligonucleotides directionally with high cloning efficiency. In some cases, this method can provide sticky end fragments in large scale for subsequent convenient cloning at low cost.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Expression of 𝛽1,6-branched N-linked oligosaccharides have a definite association with invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which these oligosaccharides regulate these processes is not well understood. Invasive variants of B16 murine melanoma, B16F10 (parent) and B16BL6 (highly invasive variant) cell lines have been used for these studies. We demonstrate that substitution of 𝛼2,6-linked sialic acids on multiantennary structures formed as a result of 𝛽1,6-branching modulate cellular adhesion on both extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane (BM) components. Removal of 𝛼2,6 sialic acids either by enzymatic desialylation or by stably down-regulating the ST6Gal-I (enzyme that catalyses the addition of 𝛼2,6-linked sialic acids on N-linked oligosaccharides) by lentiviral driven shRNA decreased the adhesion on both ECM and BM components and invasion through reconstituted BM matrigel.</p>

				<title>Region-specific vulnerability to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced neuronal death in rat brain after status epilepticus</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0877-0886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We sought to clarify the involvement and the intra-cerebral distribution variability of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a representative molecule related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death signalling pathways, in neuronal death resulting from status epilepticus in rats. The expression patterns of CHOP and glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78, a good marker of ER stress, were assessed by Western blotting, real-time PCR, Hoechst and immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum on a status epilepticus (SE) model. Double-fluorescent staining of CHOP and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labelling (TUNEL) method were performed to clarify the involvement of CHOP in cell death. SE resulted in a time-dependent increase in the expression of GRP78 and CHOP. The expression of GRP78 protein was increased at 3, 6 and 12 h after SE and no brain region variability was found. The expression of CHOP protein was also increased, reached its peak at 24 h and remained high at 48 h. CHOP protein expression, however, showed brain region variability with highest expression noted in the hippocampus followed by the striatum, and lowest in the cortex. The up-regulation of CHOP occurring at the transcriptional level was demonstrated by real-time PCR. Double fluorescence showed that CHOP expression strongly correlated with neurons undergoing apoptosis. The results indicated that SE compromises the function of the ER and that the hippocampus is more vulnerable than the cortex and the striatum.</p>

				<title>Maternal hormonal interventions as a risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder: An epidemiological assessment from India</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0887-0892</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Globalization and women empowerment have led to stressful life among Indian women. This stress impairs women’s hormonal makeup and menstrual cycle, leading to infertility. National Family Health Survey-3 (NFHS-3) reports a decline in fertility status in India, indicating a rise in various infertility treatments involving hormonal interventions. No studies are available from India on the risk association link between maternal hormonal treatments and ASD. Hence, this study explores the association of maternal hormonal interventions with risk for ASD. Parents of 942 children (471 ASD and 471 controls) across 9 cities in India participated in the questionnaire-based study. The questionnaire was pilot tested and validated for its content and reliability as a psychometric instrument. Data collection was done at 70 centres through direct interaction with parents and with the help of trained staff. Statistical analysis of data was carried out using SAS 9.1.3. Out of the 471 ASD cases analysed, 58 mothers had undergone hormonal interventions (12.3%) while there were only 22 mothers among controls who underwent hormonal interventions (4.6%). According to logistic regression analysis maternal hormonal intervention (OR=2.24) was a significant risk factor for ASD.</p>

				<title><i>ABCA1</i> C69T gene polymorphism and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Saudi population</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0893-0897</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease induced by complex interactions between environmental factors and certain genetic factors. Genetic variants in the Adenosine Binding Cassette Transporter Proteins 1 (<i>ABCA1</i>) have been associated with abnormalities of serum lipid levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). Decreased serum levels of HDL-C have often been observed in T2DM cases, and this condition has been considered to be involved in the mechanism of insulin resistance (IR). Therefore, we investigated possible association between <i>ABCA1</i> C69T gene polymorphism and T2DMin a Saudi population. This study was carried out with 380 healthy control subjects and 376 T2DM patients. Genotyping of <i>ABCA1</i> C69T polymorphism was carried out by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism technique. We observed that the frequency of the T allele of the <i>ABCA1</i> C69T gene was significantly higher in healthy subjects compared to T2DMpatients (0.28 vs 0.45; 𝑝 &#60; 0.0001; OR (95% CI) = 0.4624 (0.3732–0.5729), and therefore the T allele may be a protective factor against T2DM in the Saudi population.</p>

				<title>Signatures of positive selection in <i>LY96</i> gene in vertebrates</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0899-0904</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As a secreted glycoprotein that binds to the extracellular domain of Toll-like receptor 4 (<i>TLR4</i>), Lymphocyte Antigen 96 (<i>LY96</i>), also called myeloid differentiation 2 (<i>MD2</i>), is required for the activation of <i>TLR4</i> by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and plays an important role in innate immunity, which is the first line of defence against microbial infections. Previous studies have proposed that mammalian toll-like receptors (TLRs) have evolved under diversifying selection due to their role in pathogen detection. Given the fact that <i>LY96</i> is highly functionally linked to <i>TLR4</i>, it would be interesting to test whether <i>LY96</i> is under the intense pressure of natural selection. To investigate the natural selection hypothesis, we compared the coding sequences from 13 vertebrates and evaluated the molecular evolution of <i>LY96</i> gene in these species. Result shows that natural selection at exon 4 has indeed played a role in shaping the function of <i>LY96</i> in the course of evolution. In addition to the study of Nakajima, we found the two branch nodes with Ka/Ks ratios greater than 1: the one leading to cow and pig and the other to rabbit and the primates.</p>

				<title>Assessment of lexical semantic judgment abilities in alcohol-dependent subjects: An fMRI study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0905-0915</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Neuropsychological studies have shown that alcohol dependence is associated with neurocognitive deficits in tasks requiring memory, perceptual motor skills, abstraction and problem solving, whereas language skills are relatively spared in alcoholics despite structural abnormalities in the language-related brain regions. To investigate the preserved mechanisms of language processing in alcohol-dependents, functional brain imaging was undertaken in healthy controls (𝑛=18) and alcohol-dependents (𝑛=16) while completing a lexical semantic judgment task in a 3 T MR scanner. Behavioural data indicated that alcohol-dependents took more time than controls for performing the task but there was no significant difference in their response accuracy. fMRI data analysis revealed that while performing the task, the alcoholics showed enhanced activations in left supramarginal gyrus, precuneus bilaterally, left angular gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus as compared to control subjects. The extensive activations observed in alcoholics as compared to controls suggest that alcoholics recruit additional brain areas to meet the behavioural demands for equivalent task performance. The results are consistent with previous fMRI studies suggesting compensatory mechanisms for the execution of task for showing an equivalent performance or decreased neural efficiency of relevant brain networks. However, on direct comparison of the two groups, the results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons; therefore, the present findings need further exploration.</p>

				<title>White Spot Syndrome Virus infection in <i>Penaeus monodon</i> is facilitated by housekeeping molecules</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0917-0924</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is a major pathogen in shrimp aquaculture, and its rampant spread has resulted in great economic loss. Identification of host cellular proteins interacting with WSSV will help in unravelling the repertoire of host proteins involved in WSSV infection. In this study, we have employed one-dimensional and two-dimension virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to identify the host proteins of <i>Penaeus monodon</i> that could interact with WSSV. The VOPBA results suggest that WSSV interacted with housekeeping proteins such as heat shock protein 70, ATP synthase subunit 𝛽, phosphopyruvate hydratase, allergen Pen m 2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein, actin and 14-3-3-like protein. Our findings suggest that WSSV exploits an array of housekeeping proteins for its transmission and propagation in <i>P. monodon</i>.</p>

				<title>Biomineralization: Some complex crystallite-oriented skeletal structures</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0925-0935</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present review focuses on some specific aspects of biomineralization with regard to the evolution of the first focused visioning systems in trilobites, the formation of molluscan shell architecture, dental enamel and its biomechanical properties and the structure of the calcified amniote egg, both fossil and recent. As an interdisciplinary field, biomineralization deals with the formation, structure and mechanical strength of mineralized skeletonized tissue secreted by organisms. Mineral matter formed in this way occurs in all three domains of life and consists of several mineral varieties, of which carbonates, phosphates and opaline silica are the most common. Animals and plants need mechanical support to counteract gravitational forces on land and hydrostatic pressure in the deep ocean, which is provided by a skeletonized framework. Skeleton architecture mainly consists of basic elements represented by small usually micrometer- to nanometer-sized crystallites of calcite and aragonite for carbonate systems and apatite crystallites for phosphatic ones, and then these building blocks develop into structured more complex frameworks. As selective pressures work towards optimizing stress and response, the orientation, morphology and structural arrangement of the crystallites indicates the distribution of the stress field of the biomineralized tissue. Large animals such as the dinosaurs have to deal with large gravitational forces, but in much smaller skeletonized organism such as the coccoliths, a few micrometer in diameter made up of even smaller individual crystallites, van der Waals forces play an increasingly important role and are at present poorly understood. Skeleton formation is dependent upon many factors including ambient water chemistry, temperature and environment. Ocean chemistry has played a vital role in the origins of skeletonization, 500 to 600 million years (ma) ago with the dominance of calcium carbonate as the principal skeleton-forming tissue and with phosphates and silica as important but secondary materials. The preservation of calcareous skeletons in deep time has resulted in providing interesting information: for example, the number of days in the Devonian year has been established on the basis of well-preserved lunar (annual) cycles, and isotope chemistry has led to an elaborate protocol for using O<sup>18</sup>/O<sup>16</sup> stable isotopes for palaeotemperature measurements in the geological past. Stable isotopes of dental apatite have helped to establish ecological shifts (terrestrial to wholly marine) during the evolution of the Cetacea. Biomineralization as a field of specialization is still searching for its own independent identity, but gradually, its importance is being realized as a model for engineering applications especially at the nanometer scale.</p>

				<title>Side-effects of protein kinase inhibitors on ion channels</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0937-0949</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein kinases are one of the largest gene families and have regulatory roles in all aspects of eukaryotic cell function. Modulation of protein kinase activity is a desirable therapeutic approach for a number of human diseases associated with aberrant kinase activity, including cancers, arthritis and cardiovascular disorders. Several strategies have been used to develop specific and selective protein kinase modulators, primarily via inhibition of phosphorylation and down-regulation of kinase gene expression. These strategies are effective at regulating intracellular signalling pathways, but are unfortunately associated with several undesirable effects, particularly those that modulate ion channel function. In fact, the side-effects have precluded these inhibitors from being both useful experimental tools and therapeutically viable. This review focuses on the ion channel side-effects of several protein kinase inhibitors and specifically on those modulating K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels. It is hoped that the information provided with a detailed summary in this review will assist the future development of novel specific and selective compounds targeting protein kinases both for experimental tools and for therapeutic approaches.</p>

				<title>Origin and occurrence of sexual and mating systems in Crustacea: A progression towards communal living and eusociality</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0951-0969</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Crustaceans are known for their unrivalled diversity of sexual systems, as well as peculiar mating associations to achieve maximum mating success and fertilization accomplishment. Although sexes are separate in most species, various types of hermaphroditism characterize these predominantly aquatic arthropods. A low operational sex ratio between female and male, together with temporally limited receptivity of females towards males, imposes restrictions on the structuring of mating systems in crustaceans. The basic mating systems consist of monogamy, polygamy, mate guarding and pure searching. Understandably, ecological influences may also play a determinative role in the evolution of such sexual and mating systems in crustaceans. An important outcome of the crustacean sexual biology is the development of complex social structures in many aquatic species, in much the same way insects have established them in terrestrial conditions. In addition, groups like isopods and certain families of brachyuran crabs have shown terrestrial adaptation, exhibiting peculiar reproductive modes, sometimes reminiscent of their terrestrial counterparts, insects. Many caridean shrimps, living in symbiotic relationship with other marine invertebrates in the coral reef habitats, have reached pinnacle of complexity in sexuality and peculiar mating behaviours, resulting in communal living and establishing advanced social systems, such as eusociality.</p>

				<title>Integrated genomics and molecular breeding approaches for dissecting the complex quantitative traits in crop plants</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0971-0987</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The enormous population growth, climate change and global warming are now considered major threats to agriculture and world’s food security. To improve the productivity and sustainability of agriculture, the development of high-yielding and durable abiotic and biotic stress-tolerant cultivars and/climate resilient crops is essential. Henceforth, understanding the molecular mechanism and dissection of complex quantitative yield and stress tolerance traits is the prime objective in current agricultural biotechnology research. In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in plant genomics and molecular breeding research pertaining to conventional and next-generation whole genome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing efforts, generation of huge genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic resources and development of modern genomics-assisted breeding approaches in diverse crop genotypes with contrasting yield and abiotic stress tolerance traits. Unfortunately, the detailed molecular mechanism and gene regulatory networks controlling such complex quantitative traits is not yet well understood in crop plants. Therefore, we propose an integrated strategies involving available enormous and diverse traditional and modern –omics (structural, functional, comparative and epigenomics) approaches/resources and genomics-assisted breeding methods which agricultural biotechnologist can adopt/utilize to dissect and decode the molecular and gene regulatory networks involved in the complex quantitative yield and stress tolerance traits in crop plants. This would provide clues and much needed inputs for rapid selection of novel functionally relevant molecular tags regulating such complex traits to expedite traditional and modern marker-assisted genetic enhancement studies in target crop species for developing high-yielding stress-tolerant varieties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Secretion is widespread in all eukaryotic cells: all of us experience this in the course of daily life – saliva, mucus, sweat, tears, bile juice, adrenalin, etc. – the list is extremely long. How does a cell manage to repeatedly spit out some stuff without losing the rest? The answer is: through regulated vesicle trafficking within the cell. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2013 was awarded to Drs Randy Schekman, James E Rothman and Thomas C Südhof for their ‘discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic, a major transport system in our cells’. Dr Randy Schekman and his colleagues discovered a number of genes required for vesicle trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi; the James E Rothman group unravelled the protein machinery that allows vesicles to bud off from the membrane and fuse to their targets; and Dr Thomas C Südhof along with his colleagues revealed how calcium ions could instruct vesicles to fuse and discharge their contents with precision. These enabled the biotechnology industry to produce a variety of pharmaceutical and industrial products like insulin and hepatitis B vaccines, in a cost-efficient manner, using yeast and tissue cultured cells.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Biochemical information has been crucial for the development of evolutionary biology. On the one hand, the sequence information now appearing is producing a huge increase in the amount of data available for phylogenetic analysis; on the other hand, and perhaps more fundamentally, it allows understanding of the mechanisms that make evolution possible. Less well recognized, but just as important, understanding evolutionary biology is essential for understanding many details of biochemistry that would otherwise be mysterious, such as why the structures of NAD and other coenzymes are far more complicated than their functions would seem to require. Courses of biochemistry should thus pay attention to the essential role of evolution in selecting the molecules of life.</p>

				<title>Metabolic engineering of chloroplasts for artemisinic acid biosynthesis and impact on plant growth</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0033-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chloroplasts offer high-level transgene expression and transgene containment due to maternal inheritance, and are ideal hosts for biopharmaceutical biosynthesis via multigene engineering. To exploit these advantages, we have expressed 12 enzymes in chloroplasts for the biosynthesis of artemisinic acid (precursor of artemisinin, antimalarial drug) in an alternative plant system. Integration of transgenes into the tobacco chloroplast genome via homologous recombination was confirmed by molecular analysis, and biosynthesis of artemisinic acid in plant leaf tissues was detected with the help of <sup>13</sup>C NMR and ESI-mass spectrometry. The excess metabolic flux of isopentenyl pyrophosphate generated by an engineered mevalonate pathway was diverted for the biosynthesis of artemisinic acid. However, expression of megatransgenes impacted the growth of the transplastomic plantlets. By combining two exogenous pathways, artemisinic acid was produced in transplastomic plants, which can be improved further using better metabolic engineering strategies for commercially viable yield of desirable isoprenoid products.</p>

Using avidin-biotin affinity chromatography and mass finger printing analysis technique, herein we report the identification of a 70 kDa size protein (bovine serum albumin precursor, BSAP) which binds strongly with lipoplexes and may play role in lipofection pathway. Using multiple cultured animal cells and three structurally different cationic transfection lipids, we show that the efficiencies of liposomal transfection vectors get significantly enhanced (by &#8764;2.5- to 5.0-fold) in cells pre-transfected with lipoplexes of reporter plasmid construct encoding BSAP. Findings in the cellular uptake experiments in A549 cells cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (w/w) BODIPY-labelled BSAP are consistent with the supposition that BSAP enters cell cytoplasm from the cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) used in lipofection. Cellular uptake studies by confocal microscopy using BODIPY-labelled BSAP and FITC-labelled plasmid DNA revealed co-localization of plasmid DNA and BSAP within the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. In summary, the present findings hint at the possible involvement of BSAP in lipofection pathway.</p>

				<title>Inhibition of factor-dependent transcription termination in <i>Escherichia coli</i> might relieve xenogene silencing by abrogating H-NS-DNA interactions <i>in vivo</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0053-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many horizontally acquired genes (xenogenes) in the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> are maintained in a silent transcriptional state by the nucleoid-associated transcription regulatory protein H-NS. Recent evidence has shown that antibiotic-mediated inhibition of the transcription terminator protein Rho leads to de-repression of horizontally acquired genes, akin to a deletion of <i>hns</i>. The mechanism behind this similarity in outcomes between the perturbations of two distinct processes remains unclear. Using ChIP-seq of H-NS in wild-type cells, in addition to that in cells treated with bicyclomycin – a specific inhibitor of Rho, we show that bicyclomycin treatment leads to a decrease in binding signal for H-NS to the <i>E. coli</i> chromosome. Rho inhibition leads to RNA polymerase readthrough, which in principle could displace H-NS from the DNA, thus leading to transcriptional derepression of H-NS-silenced genes. Other possible mediators of the effect of Rho on H-NS are discussed. A possible positive feedback between Rho and H-NS might help reinforce xenogene silencing.</p>

				<title>Screening of cellular proteins that interact with the classical swine fever virus non-structural protein 5A by yeast two-hybrid analysis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0063-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), the pathogen of classical swine fever (CSF), causes severe hemorrhagic fever and vascular necrosis in domestic pigs and wild boar. A large number of evidence has proven that non-structural 5A (NS5A) is not only a very important part of viral replication complex, but also can regulate host cell’s function; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the current study, aiming to find more clues in understanding the molecular mechanisms of CSFV NS5A’s function, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was adopted to screen for CSFV NS5A interactive proteins in the cDNA library of the swine umbilical vein endothelial cell (SUVEC). Alignment with the NCBI database revealed 16 interactive proteins: DDX5, PSMC3, NAV1, PHF5A, GNB2L1, CSDE1, HSPA8, BRMS1, PPP2R3C, AIP, TMED10, POLR1C, TMEM70, METAP2, CHORDC1 and COPS6. These proteins are mostly related to gene transcription, protein folding, protein degradation and metabolism. The interactions detected by the Y2H system should be considered as preliminary results. Since identifying novel pathways and host targets, which play essential roles during infection, may provide potential targets for therapeutic development. The finding of proteins obtained from the SUVEC cDNA library that interact with the CSFV NS5A protein provide valuable information for better understanding the interactions between this viral protein and the host target proteins.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> encodes a single Rheb protein showing sequence similarity to human homologues of Rheb. The DdRheb protein shares 52% identity and 100% similarity with the human Rheb1 protein. Fluorescence of Rheb yellow fluorescent protein fusion was detected in the <i>D. discoideum</i> cytoplasm. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and whole-mount <i>in situ</i> hybridization analyses showed that <i>rheb</i> is expressed at all stages of development and in prestalk cells in the multicellular structures developed. When the expression of <i>rheb</i> as a fusion with <i>lacZ</i> was driven under its own promoter, the 𝛽-galactosidase activity was seen in the prestalk cells. <i>D. discoideum</i> overexpressing Rheb shows an increase in the size of the cell. Treatment of the overexpressing Rheb cells with rapamycin confirms its involvement in the TOR signalling pathway.</p>

				<title>FKBP12 regulates the localization and processing of amyloid precursor protein in human cell lines</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0085-0095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease is the presence of insoluble extracellular amyloid plaques. These plaques are mainly constituted of amyloid beta peptide (A𝛽), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP processing also generates the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We have previously demonstrated that AICD interacts with FKBP12, a peptidyl-prolyl <i>cis-trans</i> isomerase (PPIase) ubiquitous in nerve systems. This interaction was interfered by FK506, a clinically used immunosuppressant that has recently been reported to be neuroprotective. To elucidate the roles of FKBP12 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, the effect of FKBP12 overexpression on APP processing was evaluated. Our results revealed that APP processing was shifted towards the amyloidogenic pathway, accompanied by a change in the subcellular localization of APP, upon FKBP12 overexpression. This FKBP12-overexpression-induced effect was reverted by FK506. These findings support our hypothesis that FKBP12 may participate in the regulation of APP processing. FKBP12 overexpression may lead to the stabilization of a certain isomer (presumably the <i>cis</i> form) of the Thr668-Pro669 peptide bond in AICD, therefore change its affinity to flotillin-1 or other raft-associated proteins, and eventually change the localization pattern and cause a shift in the proteolytic processing of APP.</p>

				<title>Three-dimensional analysis of abnormal ultrastructural alteration in mitochondria of hippocampus of APP/PSEN1 transgenic mouse</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0097-0105</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The deterioration of subcellular organelles, including the mitochondria, is another major ultrastructural characteristic of AD pathogenesis, in addition to amyloid plaque deposition. However, the three-dimensional (3-D) study of mitochondrial structural alteration in AD remains poorly understood. Therefore, ultrastructural analysis, 3-D electron tomography, and immunogold electron microscopy were performed in the present study to clarify the abnormal structural alterations in mitochondria caused by the progression of AD in APP/PSEN1 transgenic mice, expressing human amyloid precursor protein, as a model for AD. Amyloid 𝛽 (A𝛽) plaques accumulated and dystrophic neurites (DN) developed in the hippocampus of transgenic AD mouse brains. We also identified the loss of peroxiredoxin 3, an endogenous cytoprotective antioxidant enzyme and the accumulation of A𝛽 in the hippocampal mitochondria of transgenic mice, which differs from those in age-matched wild-type mice. The mitochondria in A𝛽 plaque-detected regions were severely disrupted, and the patterns of ultrastructural abnormalities were classified into three groups: disappearance of cristae, swelling of cristae, and bulging of the outer membrane. These results demonstrated that morpho-functional alterations of mitochondria and AD progression are closely associated and may be beneficial in investigating the function of mitochondria in AD pathogenesis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Rhythmic sound or music is known to improve cognition in animals and humans. We wanted to evaluate the effects of prenatal repetitive music stimulation on the remodelling of the auditory cortex and visual Wulst in chicks. Fertilized eggs (0 day) of white leghorn chicken (<i>Gallus domesticus</i>) during incubation were exposed either to music or no sound from embryonic day 10 until hatching. Auditory and visual perceptual learning and synaptic plasticity, as evident by synaptophysin and PSD-95 expression, were done at posthatch days (PH) 1, 2 and 3. The number of responders was significantly higher in the music stimulated group as compared to controls at PH1 in both auditory and visual preference tests. The stimulated chicks took significantly lesser time to enter and spent more time in the maternal area in both preference tests. A significantly higher expression of synaptophysin and PSD-95 was observed in the stimulated group in comparison to control at PH1-3 both in the auditory cortex and visual Wulst. A significant inter-hemispheric and gender-based difference in expression was also found in all groups. These results suggest facilitation of postnatal perceptual behaviour and synaptic plasticity in both auditory and visual systems following prenatal stimulation with complex rhythmic music.</p>

				<title><i>Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D</i> influences systemic-acquiredresistance-induced expression and histone modifications of <i>WRKY</i> genes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0119-0126</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A plant that is in part infected by a pathogen is more resistant throughout its whole body to subsequent infections – a phenomenon known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Mobile signals are synthesized at the site of infection and distributed throughout the plant through vascular tissues. Mechanism of SAR development subsequent to reaching the mobile signal in the distal tissue is largely unknown. Recently we showed that <i>FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD)</i> gene of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> is required in the distal tissue to activate SAR. <i>FLD</i> codes for a homologue of human-lysine-specific histone demethylase. Here we show that FLD function is required for priming (SAR induced elevated expression during challenge inoculation) of <i>WRKY29</i> and <i>WRKY6</i> genes. FLD also differentially influences basal and SAR-induced expression of <i>WRKY38, WRKY65</i> and <i>WRKY53</i> genes. In addition, we also show that FLD partly localizes in nucleus and influences histone modifications at the promoters of <i>WRKY29</i> and <i>WRKY6</i> genes. The results altogether indicate to the possibility of FLD’s involvement in epigenetic regulation of SAR.</p>

				<title>Hpa1 harpin needs nitroxyl terminus to promote vegetative growth and leaf photosynthesis in Arabidopsis</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0127-0137</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hpa1 is a harpin protein produced by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i>, an important bacterial pathogen of rice, and has the growth-promoting activity in plants. To understand the molecular basis for the function of Hpa1, we generated an inactive variant protein, Hpa1𝛥NT, by deleting the nitroxyl-terminal region of the Hpa1 sequence and compared Hpa1𝛥NT with the full-length protein in terms of the effects on vegetative growth and related physiological responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. When Hpa1 was applied to plants, it acted to enhance the vegetative growth but did not affect the floral development. Enhanced plant growth was accompanied by induced expression of growth-promoting genes in plant leaves. The growth-promoting activity of Hpa1 was further correlated with a physiological consequence shown as promoted leaf photosynthesis as a result of facilitated CO<sub>2</sub> conduction through leaf stomata and mesophyll cells. On the contrary, plant growth, growth-promoting gene expression, and the physiological consequence changed little in response to the Hpa1𝛥NT treatment. These analyses suggest that Hpa1 requires the nitroxyl-terminus to facilitate CO<sub>2</sub> transport inside leaf cells and promote leaf photosynthesis and vegetative growth of the plant.</p>

				<title>Pharmaceutical and pharmacological approaches for bioavailability enhancement of etoposide</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0139-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Etoposide, a semi-synthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, is one of the most active and useful antineoplastic agent used routinely in firstline combination chemotherapy of testicular cancer, small-cell lung cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Etoposide displays narrow therapeutic index, erratic pharmacokinetics and dose individualization that needs to be achieved for overcoming inter- and intra-patient variability (25–80%), so as to maintain proper drug exposure within a therapeutic range. Etoposide posses high plasma protein binding (97%) and is degraded via complex metabolic pathways. The main pharmacokinetic determinants of etoposide are still not completely defined in order to optimize the pharmaco-therapeutic parameters including dose, therapeutic schedule and route of administration. Much research has been done to determine drug–drug and herb–drug interactions for improving the bioavailability of etoposide. The present article gives insight on pharmaceutical and pharmacological attempts made from time to time to overcome the erratic inter- and intra-patient variability for improving the bioavailability of etoposide.</p>

				<title>Apico-basal polarity complex and cancer </title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0145-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Apico-basal polarity is a cardinal molecular feature of adult eukaryotic epithelial cells and appears to be involved in several key cellular processes including polarized cell migration and maintenance of tissue architecture. Epithelial cell polarity is maintained by three well-conserved polarity complexes, namely, PAR, Crumbs and SCRIB. The location and interaction between the components of these complexes defines distinct structural domains of epithelial cells. Establishment and maintenance of apico-basal polarity is regulated through various conserved cell signalling pathways including TGF𝛽, Integrin and WNT signalling. Loss of cell polarity is a hallmark for carcinoma, and its underlying molecular mechanism is beginning to emerge from studies on model organisms and cancer cell lines. Moreover, deregulated expression of apico-basal polarity complex components has been reported in human tumours. In this review, we provide an overview of the apico-basal polarity complexes and their regulation, their role in cell migration, and finally their involvement in carcinogenesis.</p>

				<title><i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> neurogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from different sources</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0157-0169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Regenerative medicine is an evolving interdisciplinary topic of research involving numerous technological methods that utilize stem cells to repair damaged tissues. Particularly, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a great tool in regenerative medicine because of their lack of tumorogenicity, immunogenicity and ability to perform immunomodulatory as well as anti-inflammatory functions. Numerous studies have investigated the role of MSCs in tissue repair and modulation of allogeneic immune responses. MSCs derived from different sources hold unique regenerative potential as they are self-renewing and can differentiate into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, endothelial and neuronal cells, among which neuronal-like cells have gained special interest. MSCs also have the ability to secrete multiple bioactive molecules capable of stimulating recovery of injured cells and inhibiting inflammation. In this review we focus on neural differentiation potential ofMSCs isolated from different sources and how certain growth factors/small molecules can be used to derive neuronal phenotypes from MSCs. We also discuss the efficacy of MSCs when transplanted <i>in vivo</i> and how they can generate certain neurons and lead to relief or recovery of the diseased condition. Furthermore, we have tried to evaluate the appropriatemerits of different sources of MSCs with respect to their propensity towards neurological differentiation as well as their effectiveness in preclinical studies.</p>

				<title>Group behaviour in physical, chemical and biological systems</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0177-0189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groups exhibit properties that either are not perceived to exist, or perhaps cannot exist, at the individual level. Such `emergent’ properties depend on how individuals interact, both among themselves and with their surroundings. The world of everyday objects consists of material entities. These are, ultimately, groups of elementary particles that organize themselves into atoms and molecules, occupy space, and so on. It turns out that an explanation of even the most commonplace features of this world requires relativistic quantum field theory and the fact that Planck’s constant is discrete, not zero. Groups of molecules in solution, in particular polymers (`sols’), can form viscous clusters that behave like elastic solids (`gels’). Sol-gel transitions are examples of cooperative phenomena. Their occurrence is explained by modelling the statistics of inter-unit interactions: the likelihood of either state varies sharply as a critical parameter crosses a threshold value. Group behaviour among cells or organisms is often heritable and therefore can evolve. This permits an additional, typically biological, explanation for it in terms of reproductive advantage, whether of the individual or of the group. There is no general agreement on the appropriate explanatory framework for understanding group-level phenomena in biology.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0191-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Explanations for biological evolution in terms of changes in gene frequencies refer to outcomes rather than process. Integrating epigenetic studies with older evolutionary theories has drawn attention to the ways in which evolution occurs. Adaptation at the level of the gene is givingway to adaptation at the level of the organism and higher-order assemblages of organisms. These ideas impact on the theories of how cooperation might have evolved. Two of the theories, i.e. that cooperating individuals are genetically related or that they cooperate for self-interested reasons, have been accepted for a long time. The idea that adaptation takes place at the level of groups is much more controversial. However, bringing together studies of development with those of evolution is taking away much of the heat in the debate about the evolution of group behaviour.</p>

				<title>Symbiosis as the way of eukaryotic life: The dependent co-origination of the body</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0201-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular analyses of symbiotic relationships are challenging our biological definitions of individuality and supplanting them with a new notion of normal part–whole relationships. This new notion is that of a `holobiont’, a consortium of organisms that becomes a functionally integrated `whole’. This holobiont includes the zoological organism (the `animal’) as well as its persistent microbial symbionts. This new individuality is seen on anatomical and physiological levels, where a diversity of symbionts form a new `organ system’ within the zoological organism and become integrated into its metabolism and development. Moreover, as in normal development, there are reciprocal interactions between the `host’ organism and its symbionts that alter gene expression in both sets of cells. The immune system, instead of being seen as functioning solely to keep microbes out of the body, is also found to develop, in part, in dialogue with symbionts. Moreover, the immune system is actively involved in the colonization of the zoological organism, functioning as a mechanism for integrating microbes into the animal-cell community. Symbionts have also been found to constitute a second mode of genetic inheritance, providing selectable genetic variation for natural selection. We develop, grow and evolve as multi-genomic consortia/teams/ecosystems.</p>

				<title>Limb, tooth, beak: Three modes of development and evolutionary innovation of form</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0211-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The standard model of evolutionary change of form, deriving from Darwin’s theory via the Modern Synthesis, assumes a gradualistic reshaping of anatomical structures, with major changes only occurring by many cycles of natural selection for marginal adaptive advantage. This model, with its assertion that a single mechanism underlies both micro- and macroevolutionary change, contains an implicit notion of development which is only applicable in some cases. Here we compare the embryological processes that shape the vertebrate limb bud, the mammalian tooth and the avian beak. The implied notion of development in the standard evolutionary picture is met only in the case of the vertebrate limb, a single-primordium organ with morphostatic shaping, in which cells rearrange in response to signalling centres which are essentially unchanged by cell movement. In the case of the tooth, a single-primordium organ with morphodynamic shaping in which the strengths and relationships between signalling centres is influenced by the cell and tissue movements they induce, and the beak, in which the final form is influenced by the collision and rearrangement of multiple tissue primordia, abrupt appearance of qualitatively different forms (i.e. morphological novelties) can occur with small changes in system parameters induced by a genetic change, or by an environmental factor whose effects can be subsequently canalized genetically. Bringing developmental mechanisms and, specifically, the material properties of tissues as excitable media into the evolutionary picture, demonstrates that gradualistic change for incremental adaptive advantage is only one of the possible modes of morphological evolution.</p>

Relevant traits include different types of communities, production of flocculins, invertase and toxins, and the presence of apoptosis.</p>

				<title>Nascent multicellular life and the emergence of individuality</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0237-0248</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors involves a shift in the level at which selection operates. It is usual to think about this shift in terms of the emergence of traits that cause heritable differences in reproductive output at the level of nascent collectives. Defining these traits and the causes of their origin lies at the heart of understanding the evolution of multicellular life. In working toward a mechanistic, take-nothing-for-granted account, we begin by recognizing that the standard Lewontin formulation of properties necessary and sufficient for evolution by natural selection does not necessarily encompass Darwinian evolution in primitive collectives where parent-offspring relationships may have been poorly defined. This, we suggest, limits the ability to conceptualize and capture the earliest manifestations of Darwinian properties. By way of solution we propose a relaxed interpretation of Lewontin’s conditions and present these in the form of a set of necessary requirements for evolution by natural selection based upon the establishment of genealogical connections between recurrences of collectives. With emphasis on genealogy – as opposed to reproduction – it is possible to conceive selection acting on collectives prior to any manifestation of heritable variance in fitness. Such possibility draws attention to the evolutionary emergence of traits that strengthen causal relationships between recurrences – traits likely to underpin the emergence of forms of multiplication that establish parent-offspring relationships. Application of this framework to collectives of marginal status, particularly those whose recurrence is not defined by genealogy, makes clear that change at the level of collectives need not arise from selection acting at the higher level. We conclude by outlining applicability of our framework to loosely defined collectives of cells, such as those comprising the slugs of social amoeba and microbes that constitute the human microbiome.</p>

					<p>Life is a discrete, stochastic phenomenon: for a biological organism, the time of the two most important events of its life (reproduction and death) is random and these events change the number of individuals of the species by single units. These facts can have surprising, counterintuitive consequences.

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0281-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Despite intense research efforts that have provided enormous insight, cancer continues to be a poorly understood disease. There has been much debate over whether the cancerous state can be said to originate in a single cell or whether it is a reflection of aberrant behaviour on the part of a ‘society of cells’. This article presents, in the form of a debate conducted among the authors, three views of how the problem might be addressed. We do not claim that the views exhaust all possibilities. These views are </p>
					<ul>
						<li>the tissue organization field theory (TOFT) that is based on a breakdown of tissue organization involving many cells from different embryological layers,</li>
						<li>the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis that focuses on genetic and epigenetic changes that take place within single cells, and</li>
						<li>the proposition that rewiring of the cell’s protein interaction networks mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) drives the tumorigenic process.</li>
					</ul> 
					<p>The views are based on different philosophical approaches. In detail, they differ on some points and agree on others. It is left to the reader to decide whether one approach to understanding cancer appears more promising than the other.</p>

				<title>Individuals and groups in evolution: Darwinian pluralism and the multilevel selection debate</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0319-0325</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Outlined here is an updated review of the long-standing `kin selection vs group selection’ debate. Group selection is a highly contentious concept, scientifically and philosophically. In 2012, Dawkins’ attack against Wilson’s latest book about eusociality concentrated all the attention on group selection and its mutual exclusivity with respect to inclusive fitness theory. Both opponents seem to be wrong, facing the general consensus in the field, which favours a pluralistic approach. Historically, despite some misunderstandings in current literature, such a perspective is clearly rooted in Darwin’s writings, which suggested a plurality of levels of selection and a general view that we propose to call `imperfect selfishness’. Today, the mathematically updated hypothesis of group selection has little to do with earlier versions of `group selection’. It does not imply ontologically unmanageable notions of `groups’. We propose here population structure as the main criterion of compatibility between kin selection and group selection. The latter is now evidently a pattern among others within a more general `multilevel selection’ theory. Different explanations and patterns are not mutually exclusive. Such a Darwinian pluralism is not a piece of the past, but a path into the future. A challenge in philosophy of biology will be to figure out the logical structure of this emerging pluralistic theory of evolution in such contentious debates.</p>

				<title>miRNAting control of DNA methylation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0365-0380</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic modification where a methyl group is added to the cytosine or adenine residue of a given DNA sequence. It has been observed that DNA methylation is achieved by some collaborative agglomeration of certain proteins and non-coding RNAs. The assembly of <i>IDN2</i> and its homologous proteins with siRNAs recruits the enzyme <i>DRM2</i>, which adds a methyl group at certain cytosine residues within the DNA sequence. In this study, it was found that <i>de novo</i> DNA methylation might be regulated by miRNAs through systematic targeting of the genes involved in DNA methylation. A comprehensive genome-wide and system-level study of miRNA targeting, transcription factors, DNA-methylation-causing genes and their target genes has provided a clear picture of an interconnected relationship of all these factors which regulate DNA methylation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The study has identified a DNA methylation system that is controlled by four different genes: <i>IDN2, IDNl1, IDNl2</i> and <i>DRM2</i>. These four genes along with various critical transcription factors appear to be controlled by five different miRNAs. Altogether, DNA methylation appears to be a finely tuned process of opposite control systems of DNA-methylation-causing genes and certain miRNAs pitted against each other.</p>

				<title>Multiple proteins of <i>White spot syndrome virus</i> involved in recognition of 𝛽-integrin </title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0381-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recognition and attachment of virus to its host cell surface is a critical step for viral infection. Recent research revealed that 𝛽-integrin was involved in <i>White spot syndrome virus</i> (WSSV) infection. In this study, the interaction of 𝛽-integrin with structure proteins of WSSV and motifs involved in WSSV infection was examined. The results showed that envelope proteins VP26, VP31, VP37, VP90 and nucleocapsid protein VP136 interacted with LvInt. RGD-, YGL- and LDV-related peptide functioned as motifs of WSSV proteins binding with 𝛽-integrin. The 𝛽-integrin ligand of RGDT had better blocking effect compared with that of YGL- and LDV-related peptides. <i>In vivo</i> assay indicated that RGD-, LDV- and YGL-related peptides could partially block WSSV infection. These data collectively indicate that multiple proteins were involved in recognition of 𝛽-integrin. Identification of proteins in WSSV that are associated with 𝛽-integrin will assist development of new agents for effective control of the white spot syndrome.</p>

				<title>Identification of chikungunya virus interacting proteins in mammalian cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0389-0399</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Identification and characterization of virus host interactions is an essential step for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Very few studies have been targeted towards identification of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) interacting host proteins. In current study, virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight analysis (MALDI TOF/TOF) were employed for the identification of CHIKV binding proteins in mammalian cells. HSP70 and actin were identified as virus binding proteins in HEK-293T and Vero-E6 cells, whereas STAT-2 was identified as an additional protein in Vero-E6 cells. Pre-incubation with anti-HSP70 antibody and miRNA silencing of HSP70 significantly reduced the CHIKV production in HEK-293T and Vero-E6 cells at early time points. These results suggest that CHIKV exploits the housekeeping molecules such as actin, HSP70 and STAT-2 to establish infection in the mammalian cells.</p>

				<title>Differential expression of speckled POZ protein, SPOP: Putative regulation by <i>miR-145</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0401-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The speckle POZ protein, SPOP, is an adaptor of the Cul3-based ubiquitination process, and has been implicated in the carcinogenesis process. Despite recent elucidation of biological functions, regulation of <i>SPOP</i> gene expression has not been reported. In this study, the mRNA levels of the mouse <i>SPOP</i> (<i>mSPOP</i>) gene were first shown to vary noticeably in different tissues. However, the SPOP protein was detected in high abundance only in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and seminiferous tubule of the testis, echoing previous reports of involvement of ubiquitination in neuron cells and in spermatogenesis. In other mouse tissues and human cancer cell lines analysed, only low SPOP protein levels were detected. The 3&#8242;-untranslated regions of both the <i>mSPOP</i> and human <i>SPOP</i> transcripts harbor a conserved putative <i>miR-145</i> binding site (BS). In some tissues and cell lines, <i>miR-145</i> and SPOP protein levels were in an inverse relationship suggesting <i>miR-145</i> regulation. Luciferase assays of deletion and point mutation constructs of the <i>miR-145</i> BS, and <i>miR-145</i> induction by serum starvation that resulted in reduced endogenous SPOP levels provided further evidence that <i>miR-145</i> is likely involved in post-transcriptional regulation of SPOP expression in selected tissues, and possibly with the participation of other miRNA species.</p>

				<title>DNA microarray analysis of genes differentially expressed in adipocyte differentiation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0415-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the human liposarcoma cell line SW872 was used to identify global changes in gene expression profiles occurring during adipogenesis. We further explored some of the genes expressed during the late phase of adipocyte differentiation. These genes may play a major role in promoting excessive proliferation and accumulation of lipid droplets, which contribute to the development of obesity. By using microarray-based technology, we examined differential gene expression in early differentiated adipocytes and late differentiated adipocytes. Validated genes exhibited a &#8805; 10-fold increase in the late phase of adipocyte differentiation by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with undifferentiated preadipocytes, we found that 763 genes were increased in early differentiated adipocytes, and 667 genes were increased in later differentiated adipocytes. Furthermore, 21 genes were found being expressed 10-fold higher in the late phase of adipocyte differentiation. The results were in accordance with the RT-PCR test, which validated 11 genes, namely, CIDEC, PID1, LYRM1, ADD1, PPAR𝛾2, ANGPTL4, ADIPOQ, ACOX1, FIP1L1, MAP3K2 and PEX14. Most of these genes were found being expressed in the later phase of adipocyte differentiation involved in obesity-related diseases. The findings may help to better understand the mechanism of obesity and related diseases.</p>

				<title>A survey of chlortetracycline concentration in feed and its residue in chicken egg in commercial layer farms</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The worldwide increase in the use of antibiotics as an integral part of poultry and livestock production industry has recently received increasing attention as a contributory factor in the international emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in human beings. To gauge the presence of the aforementioned scenario in the Indian context, a preliminary survey was conducted to assess the use of chlortetracycline (CTC) in 12 commercial layer farms and to quantify and confirm its residue in the egg. Samples of feed and eggs were collected at day 0 (prior to CTC addition), 3rd, 5th and 7th day during treatment and on the 9th and 14th day (2nd and 7th day after withdrawal of CTC) from each of the 12 commercial poultry farms studied. Concentration of CTC in feed was significantly (𝑃 &#60; 0.01) high on the 3rd, 5th and 7th day. On the 9th day and 14th day CTC concentration in feed was significantly (𝑃 &#60;0.01) lower compared to the earlier 3 days studied. A highly significant difference (𝑃 &#60;0.01) of the antibiotic residue in egg was observed in all the 5 days with high residual levels of CTC in egg. CTC in feed and its residue in egg were detected even on the 9th and 14th day respectively.</p>

				<title>Hypoxia influences expression profile of Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 2 in Indian catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (Linnaeus, 1758): A new candidate gene for hypoxia tolerance in fish</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0433-0442</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several physiologically important genes were found to be regulated by hypoxia at the transcriptional level. The Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 2 (<i>PHLDA2</i>) gene was previously identified as an imprinted gene. The present study was aimed to determine the structure of complete cDNA and the deduced protein of PHLDA2 along with analysing the changes in its mRNA expression in <i>Clarias batrachus</i> tissues under hypoxic conditions. The complete cDNA of <i>CbPHLDA2</i> gene consisted of 1009 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 417 nucleotides. The deduced CbPHLDA2 protein of 139 amino acids shared high homology with PHLD2A of other fishes as well as that of vertebrates. Importantly, a single amino acid (asparagine/lysine) insertion was identified in the PH domain of CbPHLDA2 and other fishes, which was absent in other vertebrates studied. Furthermore, under normoxic conditions, <i>CbPHLDA2</i> was constitutively expressed with varying levels in analysed tissues. Short- and long-term hypoxia exposure resulted in significant changes in the expression of <i>CbPHLDA2</i> in liver, spleen, head kidney, brain and muscle in a time-dependent manner. The results suggested that CbPHLDA2 might play an important role for adaptive significance under hypoxia.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of antibody response in mice against avian influenza A (H5N1) strain neuraminidase expressed in yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0443-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Avian influenza has raised many apprehension in the recent years because of its potential transmitability to humans. With the increasing emergence of drug-resistant avian influenza strains, development of potential vaccines are imperative to manage this disease. Two structural antigens, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, have been the target candidates for the development of subunit vaccine against influenza. In an effort to develop a faster and economically beneficial vaccine, the neuraminidase gene of a highly pathogenic avian influenza isolate was cloned and expressed in the methylotrophic yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i>. The recombinant neuraminidase (rNA) antigen was purified, and its bioactivity was analysed. The rNA was found to be functional, as determined by the neuraminidase assay. Four groups of mice were immunized with different concentrations of purified rNA antigen, which were adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide. The immune response against rNA was analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neuraminidase inhibition assay. The mice groups immunized with 25 𝜇g and 10 𝜇g of antigen had a significant immune response against rNA. This method can be utilized for faster and cost-effective development of vaccines for a circulating and newer strain of avian influenza, and would aid in combating the disease in a pandemic situation, in which production time matters greatly.</p>

				<title>Molecular screening of Chinese medicinal plants for progestogenic and anti-progestogenic activity</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0453-0461</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estrogen and progestins have adverse effects, and many of these adverse effects are caused by progestins. Due to this, many women choose to use botanical alternatives for hormone replacement therapy, which does not trigger steroidogenic properties. Therefore, it is necessary to screen these herbs for progestogenic and anti-progestogenic properties. Extract of 13 Chinese medicinal plants were analysed for progestogenic and anti-progestogenic activities by using progesterone response element-driven luciferase reporter gene bioassay. MTT assay was carried out to investigate the cytotoxic effect of herb extract on PAE cells. Among the 13 herbs, <i>Dipsacus asperoides</i> extract exhibited progestogenic activity, and 10 species – <i>Cortex eucommiae, Folium artemisiae argyi, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Angelica sinensis, Atractylodes macrocephala koidz, Scutellaria baicalensis, Cuscuta chinensis, Euscaphis japonica, Ailanthus altissima</i>, and <i>Dioscorea opposita</i> – were recognized to have anti-progestogenic like activities. Extract of <i>Dipsacus asperoides</i> demonstrated dose-dependent progestogenic activity, and the progestogenic activity of 100 𝜇g/mL extracts was equivalent to 31.45 ng/mL progesterone activity. Herbs extracts that exhibited anti-progestogenic-like activity also inhibited the 314.46 ng/mL progesterone activity in a dose-response manner. None of the herb extracts shown significant toxic effect on PAE cells at 40–100 𝜇g/mL compared to control. This discovery will aid selection of suitable herbs for hormone replacement therapy.</p>

				<title>Modelling the transition from simple to complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0463-0484</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A mathematical model is proposed which systematically investigates complex calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. This model is based on calcium-induced calcium release via inositol trisphosphate receptors (IPR) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) and includes calcium modulation of inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) levels through feedback regulation of degradation and production. In our model, the apical and the basal regions are separated by a region containing mitochondria, which is capable of restricting Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to the apical region. We were able to reproduce the observed oscillatory patterns, from baseline spikes to sinusoidal oscillations. The model predicts that calcium-dependent production and degradation of IP<sub>3</sub> is a key mechanism for complex calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. A partial bifurcation analysis is performed which explores the dynamic behaviour of the model in both apical and basal regions.</p>

				<title>Life at a different pace: Annual itineraries are conserved in seasonal songbirds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0485-0491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The duration of life history state (LHS) reflects the adaptive strategy a species has evolved to cope with a changing environment. Inhabitants at different latitudes may thus have significant differences in the rates of metabolic and physiological processes underlying LHSs. Birds, in order to maximize their fitness in the environment in which they live, seasonally switch from one LHS to another during the year. The present study investigated whether an annual itinerary of a species would determine its rate of reaction to inductive long days. We compared the photoinduced cycles of changes in body mass and testes, as indices of migratory and reproductive LHSs, between two long day breeding species, the migratory redheaded bunting and non-migratory Indian weaverbird. Changes in body mass and testis size were measured in photosensitive buntings and weaverbirds (𝑛 = 7 each) on short days (LD 8:16) subjected first to 0.5 h weekly light increments until the light period was 13 h per day, and then maintained on LD 13:11 for another 32 weeks. A similar observation was recorded on a group of buntings (𝑛 = 14) and weaverbirds (𝑛 = 9) maintained on increasing natural day lengths (NDL; Lucknow, 26&#176;55&#8242; N, 80&#176;59&#8242; E) for 47 weeks. As predicted, the rates of induction of seasonal cycles under an identical inductive photoperiod were significantly faster in temperate buntings with five annual LHSs than in the subtropical weaverbirds with three annual LHSs. This suggests that annual itineraries of songbirds with which they may have evolved with at their breeding latitudes, determine their response to the external photoperiodic environment.</p>

				<title>The evolutionary strata of DARPP-32 tail implicates hierarchical functional expansion in higher vertebrates</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0493-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DARPP-32 (dopamine and adenosine 3&#8242;,5&#8242;-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa), which belongs to <i>PPP1R1</i> gene family, is known to act as an important integrator in dopamine-mediated neurotransmission via the inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). Besides its neuronal roles, this protein also behaves as a key player in pathological and pharmacological aspects. Use of bioinformatics and phylogenetics approaches to further characterize the molecular features of DARPP-32 can guide future works. Predicted phosphorylation sites on DARPP-32 show conservation across vertebrates. Phylogenetics analysis indicates evolutionary strata of phosphorylation site acquisition at the C-terminus, suggesting functional expansion of DARPP-32, where more diverse signalling cues may involve in regulating DARPP-32 in inhibiting PP1 activity. Moreover, both phylogenetics and synteny analyses suggest <i>de novo</i> origination of <i>PPP1R1</i> gene family via chromosomal rearrangement and exonization.</p>

				<title>The rare intracellular <i>RET</i> mutation p.S891A in a Chinese Han family with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0505-0512</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report intracellular <i>RET</i> mutation in a Han Chinese pedigree with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Direct sequencing of <i>RET</i> proto-oncogene identified a missense c.2671T &#62; G (p.S891A) mutation in 6 of 14 family members. The single nucleotide polymorphisms c. 135A &#62; G (p.A45A), IVS4+48A &#62;G, c. 1296A &#62; G (p.A432A), c. 2071G &#62; A (p.G691S), c. 2307T &#62; G (p.L769L) and a variant c. 833C &#62; A (p.T278N) were also found in 6 carriers. Among 5 of the 6 carriers presented medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) as an isolated clinical phenotype, with elevated basal serum calcitonin (Ct). Two underwent non-normative thyroidectomy either two or four times without physician awareness or diagnosis of this disease at initial treatment, but with elevated Ct. One with elevated pre-Ct accepted total thyroidectomy (TT) with modified bilateral neck dissection (MBiND), and whose seventh posterior rib MTC metastases was confirmed 5 months after surgery. Moreover, results of two affected individuals with elevated Ct were reduced to normal after TT with MBiND or prophylactic VI compartmental dissection. However, only another carrier with the variant p.T278N had slightly elevated Ct rejected surgery and was strictly monitored. Given these case results, we suggest that screening of <i>RET</i> and pre-surgical Ct levels in the management of MTC patients is essential for earlier diagnosis and more normative initial treatment, that FMTC patients with cervical lymph nodes metastases may be cured by TT with MBiND, and that prophylactic VI compartmental dissection should be avoided when Ct levels are low.</p>

				<page>0513-0517</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Crop domestication, in general, has reduced genetic diversity in cultivated gene pool of chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>) as compared with wild species (<i>C. reticulatum, C. bijugum</i>). To explore impact of domestication on symbiosis, 10 accessions of chickpeas, including 4 accessions of <i>C. arietinum</i>, and 3 accessions of each of <i>C. reticulatum</i> and <i>C. bijugum</i> species, were selected and DNAs were extracted from their nodules. To distinguish chickpea symbiont, preliminary sequences analysis was attempted with 9 genes (16S rRNA, <i>atpD, dnaJ, glnA, gyrB, nifH, nifK, nodD</i> and <i>recA</i>) of which 3 genes (<i>gyrB, nifK</i> and <i>nodD</i>) were selected based on sufficient sequence diversity for further phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence diversity for 3 genes demonstrated that sequences from <i>C. reticulatum</i> were more diverse. Nodule occupancy by dominant symbiont also indicated that <i>C. reticulatum</i> (60%) could have more various symbionts than cultivated chickpea (80%). The study demonstrated that wild chickpeas (<i>C. reticulatum</i>) could be used for selecting more diverse symbionts in the field conditions and it implies that chickpea domestication affected symbiosis negatively in addition to reducing genetic diversity.</p>

				<title>MicroRNAs as regulators of cutaneous wound healing </title>
				<feature>Mini-review</feature>
				<page>0519-0524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, and have displayed important roles in areas spanning from embryonic development to skin physiology. Despite this, till now little is known about the significance of miRNAs in cutaneous wound healing. In this mini-review, we discuss the existing evidence on the roles of miRNAs in physiological processes relevant to cutaneous wound healing, followed by a highlight of the prospects and challenges of future development of miRNA-based wound therapies. With existing technologies of nucleic acid transfer and miRNA modulation, it is anticipated that once the roles of miRNAs in wound healing have been clarified, there will be a vast new vista of opportunities brought up for development of miRNA-targeted therapies for wound care.</p>

				<title>Conservation of PHO pathway in ascomycetes and the role of Pho84</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0525-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the phosphate signalling and response pathway, known as PHO pathway, monitors phosphate cytoplasmic levels by controlling genes involved in scavenging, uptake and utilization of phosphate. Recent attempts to understand the phosphate starvation response in other ascomycetes have suggested the existence of both common and novel components of the budding yeast PHO pathway in these ascomycetes. In this review, we discuss the components of PHO pathway, their roles in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in yeast and their conservation across ascomycetes. The role of high-affinity transporter, Pho84, in sensing and signalling of phosphate has also been discussed.</p>

				<title>Gene therapy in India: A focus</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0537-0541</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gene therapy refers to the treatment of genetic diseases using normal copies of the defective genes. It has the potential to cure any genetic disease with long-lasting therapeutic benefits. It remained an enigma for a long period of time, which was followed by a series of setbacks in the late 1990s. Gene therapy has re-emerged as a therapeutic option with reports of success from recent clinical studies. The United States and Europe has been pioneers in this field for over two decades. Recently, reports of gene therapy have started coming in from Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea. This review focuses on the current status of gene therapy in India.</p>

				<title>Molecular determinants of odorant receptor function in insects </title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0555-0563</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The olfactory system of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> provides a powerful model to study molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying function of a sensory system. In the 1970s Siddiqi and colleagues pioneered the application of genetics to olfactory research and isolated several mutant <i>Drosophila</i> with odorant-specific defects in olfactory behaviour, suggesting that odorants are detected differentially by the olfactory system. Since then basic principles of olfactory system function and development have emerged using <i>Drosophila</i> as a model. Nearly four decades later we can add computational methods to further our understanding of how specific odorants are detected by receptors. Using a comparative approach we identify two categories of short amino acid sequence motifs: ones that are conserved family-wide predominantly in the C-terminal half of most receptors, and ones that are present in receptors that detect a specific odorant, 4-methylphenol, found predominantly in the N-terminal half. The odorant-specific sequence motifs are predictors of phenol detection in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and other insects, suggesting they are likely to participate in odorant binding. Conversely, the family-wide motifs are expected to participate in shared functions across all receptors and a mutation in the most conserved motif leads to a reduction in odor response. These findings lay a foundation for investigating functional domains within odorant receptors that can lead to a molecular understanding of odor detection.</p>

				<title>A map of taste neuron projections in the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0565-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We provide a map of the projections of taste neurons in the CNS of <i>Drosophila</i>. Using a collection of 67 <i>GAL4</i> drivers representing the entire repertoire of Gr taste receptors, we systematically map the projections of neurons expressing these drivers in the thoracico-abdominal ganglion and the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG). We define 9 categories of projections in the thoracico-abdominal ganglia and 10 categories in the SOG. The projection patterns are modular, and can be interpreted as combinations of discrete pattern elements. The elements can be interpreted in terms of the taste organ from which the projections originate, the structures from which they originate, and the quality of taste information that they represent. The extensive diversity in projection patterns provides an anatomical basis for functional diversity in responses elicited by different taste stimuli.</p>

				<title>Serotonergic neurons of the <i>Drosophila</i> air-puff-stimulated flight circuit</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0575-0583</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monoaminergic modulation of insect flight is well documented. Recently, we demonstrated that synaptic activity is required in serotonergic neurons for <i>Drosophila</i> flight. This requirement is during early pupal development, when the flight circuit is formed, as well as in adults. Using a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activity-based GFP reporter, here we show that serotonergic neurons in both prothoracic and mesothoracic segments are activated upon air-puff-stimulated flight. Moreover ectopic activation of the entire serotonergic system by TrpA1, a heat activated cation channel, induces flight, even in the absence of an air-puff stimulus.</p>

				<page>0585-0594</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A diverse range of organisms shows physiological and behavioural rhythms with various periods. Extensive studies have been performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms with an approximately 24 h period in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals, while less attention has been paid to ultradian rhythms with shorter periods. We used a video-tracking method to monitor the movement of single flies, and clear ultradian rhythms were detected in the locomotor behaviour of wild type and clock mutant flies kept under constant dark conditions. In particular, the <i>Pigment-dispersing factor</i> mutant (<i>Pdf<sup>01</sup></i>) demonstrated a precise and robust ultradian rhythmicity, which was not temperature compensated. Our results suggest that <i>Drosophila</i> has an endogenous ultradian oscillator that is masked by circadian rhythmic behaviours.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Groundbreaking work by Obaid Siddiqi has contributed to the powerful genetic toolkit that is now available for studying the nervous system of <i>Drosophila</i>. Studies carried out in this powerful neurogenetic model system during the last decade now provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that operate in neural stem cells during normal brain development and during abnormal brain tumorigenesis. These studies also provide strong support for the notion that conserved molecular genetic programs act in brain development and disease in insects and mammals including humans.</p>

				<title>Gender based disruptive selection maintains body size polymorphism in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0609-0620</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Darwinian fitness in holometabolous insects like the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is reported to be positively correlated with body size. If large individuals in a population have higher fitness, then one would expect directional selection to operate leading to uniformly large individuals. However, size polymorphism persists in nature and needs further probing. We assessed the effect of body size on some of the fitness and fitness-related traits in replicate populations of genotypically large, genotypically small and phenotypically small <i>D. melanogaster</i> flies. In this study, the time taken to attain reproductive maturity and copulation duration were independent of fly size. Fecundity and longevity of large females were significantly higher when they partnered genotypically small males than when they were with genotypically larger or phenotypically small males. The increased female longevity when in association with genotypically small males was not due to selective early death of males that would release the female partner from presumed cost of persistent courtship. On the contrary, the genotypically as well as phenotypically small males had significantly higher longevity than large males. The virility of the genotypically small males was not significantly different from that of genotypically large males. Our results clearly show that selection on body size operates in the opposite direction (disruptive selection) for the two genders, thus explaining the persistence of size polymorphisms in the holometabolous insect, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.</p>

				<title>2ʹ-<i>O</i>-methyl nucleotide modified DNA substrates influence the cleavage efficiencies of <i>Bam</i>HI and <i>Bgl</i>II</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0621-0630</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Induction of endonucleolytic DNA cleavage is an essential event that links the initiating stimuli to the final effects of cells. The cleavage efficiency and thus the final yield could be affected by many factors, including structures of DNA substrates, composite structures of enzymes–substrates or enzymes–nucleic analogs and so on. However, it is not clear whether a nucleotide derivative-substituted in DNA substrates can influence the efficiency of enzymatic cleavage. To investigate the effect of sugar pucker conformation on DNA–protein interactions, we used 2&#8242;-𝑂-methyl modified nucleotides (OMeN) to modify DNA substrates of isocaudemers <i>Bam</i>HI and <i>Bgl</i>II in this study, and used FRET assay as an efficient method for analysis of enzyme cleavage. Experimental results demonstrated that OMeN-substituted recognition sequences influenced the cleavage rates significantly in a position-dependent manner. OMeN substitutions can reduce the cleavage as expected. Surprisingly, OMeN substitutions can also enhance the cleavage rates. The kinetics parameters of 𝑉<sub>max</sub> and 𝐾<sub>m</sub> have been obtained by fitting the Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation. These 2&#8242;-OMe nucleotides could behave as a regulatory element to modulate the enzymatic activity <i>in vitro</i>, and this property could enrich our understanding about the endonuclease cleavage mechanism and enhance our ability to regulate the enzymatic cleavage efficiency for applications in synthetic biology.</p>

				<title>Avoiding acidic region streaking in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis: Case study with two bacterial whole cell protein extracts</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0631-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acidic region streaking (ARS) is one of the lacunae in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) of bacterial proteome. This streaking is primarily caused by nucleic acid (NuA) contamination and poses major problem in the downstream processes like image analysis and protein identification. Although cleanup and nuclease digestion are practiced as remedial options, these strategies may incur loss in protein recovery and perform incomplete removal of NuA. As a result, ARS has remained a common observation across publications, including the recent ones. In this work, we demonstrate how ultrasound wave can be used to shear NuA in plain ice-cooled water, facilitating the elimination of ARS in the 2DE gels without the need for any additional sample cleanup tasks. In combination with a suitable buffer recipe, IEF program and frequent paper-wick changing approach, we are able to reproducibly demonstrate the production of clean 2DE gels with improved protein recovery and negligible or no ARS. We illustrate our procedure using whole cell protein extracts from two diverse organisms, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. Our designed protocols are straightforward and expected to provide good 2DE gels without ARS, with comparable times and significantly lower cost.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Limnological data of four high altitude lakes from the cold desert region of Himachal Pradesh, India, has been correlated with cyanobacterial diversity. Physico-chemical characteristics and nutrient contents of the studied lakes revealed that Sissu Lake is mesotrophic while Chandra Tal, Suraj Tal and Deepak Tal are ultra-oligotrophic. Based on morphology and 16S rRNA gene sequence, a total of 20 cyanobacterial species belonging to 11 genera were identified. Canonical correspondence analysis distinguished three groups of species with respect to their occurrence and nutrient/physical environment demand. The first group, which included <i>Nostoc linckia, N. punctiforme, Nodularia sphaerocarpa, Geitlerinema acutissimum, Limnothrix redekii, Planktothrix agardhii</i> and <i>Plank. clathrata</i>, was characteristic of water with high nutrient content and high temperature. The second group, including <i>Gloeocapsopsis pleurocapsoides, Leptolyngbya antarctica, L. frigida, Pseudanabaena frigida</i> and <i>N. spongiaeforme</i>, occurred in oligotrophic water with high pH and low temperature. The distribution of third group of <i>Cyanobium parvum, Synechocystis pevalekii, L. benthonica, L. foveolarum, L. lurida, L. valderiana, Phormidium autumnale</i> and <i>P. chalybeum</i> could not be associated with a particular environmental condition because of their presence in all sampling sites.</p>

				<title>Conserved C-terminal nascent peptide binding domain of HYPK facilitates its chaperone-like activity</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0659-0672</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human HYPK (Huntingtin Yeast-two-hybrid Protein K) is an intrinsically unstructured chaperone-like protein with no sequence homology to known chaperones. HYPK is also known to be a part of ribosome-associated protein complex and present in polysomes. The objective of the present study was to investigate the evolutionary influence on HYPK primary structure and its impact on the protein’s function. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed 105 orthologs of human HYPK from plants, lower invertebrates to mammals. C-terminal part of HYPK was found to be particularly conserved and to contain nascent polypeptide-associated alpha subunit (NPAA) domain. This region experiences highest selection pressure, signifying its importance in the structural and functional evolution. NPAA domain of human HYPK has unique amino acid composition preferring glutamic acid and happens to be more stable from a conformational point of view having higher content of 𝛼-helices than the rest. Cell biology studies indicate that overexpressed C-terminal human HYPK can interact with nascent proteins, co-localizes with huntingtin, increases cell viability and decreases caspase activities in Huntington’s disease (HD) cell culture model. This domain is found to be required for the chaperone-like activity of HYPK <i>in vivo</i>. Our study suggested that by virtue of its flexibility and nascent peptide binding activity, HYPK may play an important role in assisting protein (re)folding.</p>

				<title>Skin anti-photoaging properties of ginsenoside Rh2 epimers in UV-B-irradiated human keratinocyte cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0673-0682</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ginseng, one of the most widely used herbal medicines, has a wide range of therapeutic and pharmacological applications. Ginsenosides are the major bioactive ingredients of ginseng, which are responsible for various pharmacological activities of ginseng. Ginsenoside Rh2, known as an antitumour ginsenoside, exists as two different stereoisomeric forms, 20(𝑆)-ginsenoside Rh2 [20(𝑆)-Rh2] and 20(𝑅)-ginsenoside Rh2 [20(𝑅)-Rh2]. This work aimed to assess and compare skin anti-photoaging activities of 20(𝑆)-Rh2 and 20(𝑅)-Rh2 in UV-B-irradiated HaCat cells. 20(𝑆)-Rh2, but not 20(𝑅)-Rh2, was able to suppress UV-B-induced ROS production in HaCat cells. Both stereoisomeric forms could not modulate cellular survival and NO level in UV-B-irradiated HaCat cells. Both 20(𝑆)-Rh2 and 20(𝑅)-Rh2 exhibited suppressive effects on UV-B-induced MMP-2 activity and expression in HaCat cells. In brief, the two stereoisomers of ginsenoside Rh2, 20(𝑆)-Rh2 and 20(𝑅)-Rh2, possess skin anti-photoaging effects but possibly in different fashions.</p>

				<title><i>Herpes simplex virus</i> types 1 and 2 modulate autophagy in SIRC corneal cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0683-0692</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Autophagy and apoptosis function as important early cellular defense mechanisms in infections and other diseases. The outcome of an infection is determined by a complex interplay between the pathogenic microorganism and these intracellular pathways. To better understand the cytopathogenicity of <i>Herpes simplex virus</i> types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and - 2), we studied the effect of these viruses on the autophagic and apoptotic processes in the SIRC corneal cell line. Infection with the KOS strain of HSV-1 and a wild-type strain of HSV-2 enhanced autophagosome formation, triggered cytoplasmic acidification, increased LC3B lipidation and elevated the ratio of apoptotic cells. The autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 triggered a significant increase in the apoptotic responses of HSV-1- and HSV-2-infected cells. Thus, both HSV types affect autophagy and apoptosis in a coordinated fashion, and autophagy plays cytoprotective role in HSV-infected cells via antagonizing apoptosis. Together these data implicate autophagy in the pathogenic mechanism of herpetic keratitis.</p>

				<title>Platelet-derived growth factor mediates interleukin-13-induced collagen I production in mouse airway fibroblasts</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0693-0700</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is associated with the production of collagen in airway remodelling of asthma. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-13 induction of collagen remain unclear; the aim of this study is to address this issue. IL-13 dose- and time-dependently-induced collagen I production in primary cultured airway fibroblasts; this was accompanied with the STAT6 phosphorylation, and pre-treatment of cells with JAK inhibitor suppressed IL-13-induced collagen I production. Further study indicated that IL-13 stimulated JAK/STAT6-dependent PDGF production and subsequent ERK1/2 MAPK activation in airway fibroblasts, and the presence of either PDGF receptor blocker or MEK inhibitor partially suppressed IL-13-induced collagen I production. Taken together, our study suggests that activation of JAK/STAT6 signal pathway and subsequent PDGF generation and resultant ERK1/2 MAPK activation mediated IL-13-induced collagen I production in airway fibroblasts.</p>

				<title>Determining sensitive stages for learning to detect predators in larval bronzed frogs: Importance of alarm cues in learning</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0701-0710</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Successful survival and reproduction of prey organisms depend on their ability to detect their potential predators accurately and respond effectively with suitable defences. Predator detection can be innate or can be acquired through learning.We studied prey–predator interactions in the larval bronzed frogs (<i>Sylvirana temporalis</i>), which have the innate ability to detect certain predators. We conducted a series of experiments to determine if the larval <i>S. temporalis</i> rely solely on innate predator detection mechanisms or can also learn to use more specific cues such as conspecific alarm cues for the purpose. The results of our study clearly indicate that larval <i>S. temporalis</i> use both innate and learned mechanisms for predator detection. Predator-naïve tadpoles could detect kairomones alone as a potential threat and responded by reducing activity, suggesting an innate predator detection mechanism. Surprisingly, predator-naïve tadpoles failed to detect conspecific alarm cues as a potential threat, but learned to do so through experience. After acquiring the ability to detect conspecific alarm cues, they could associate novel predator cues with conspecific alarm cues. Further, post feeding stages of larval <i>S. temporalis</i> are sensitive for learning to detect conspecific alarm cues to label novel predators.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0711-0716</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Epi-endophytic green algae comprise one of the most diverse and phylogenetically primitive groups of green algae and are considered to be ubiquitous in the world’s oceans; however, no reports of these algae exist from India. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of <i>Ulvella</i> growing on intertidal green algae <i>Cladophora glomerata</i> and benthic red algae <i>Laurencia obtusa</i> collected from India. DNA barcodes at nuclear ribosomal DNA Internal Transcriber Spacer (nrDNA ITS) 1 and 2 regions for Indian isolates from the west and east coasts have been generated for the first time. Based on morphology and DNA barcoding, isolates were identified as <i>Ulvella leptochaete</i>. Phylogenetic reconstruction of concatenated dataset using Maximum Likelihood method differentiated Indian isolates from other accessions of this alga available in Genbank, albeit with low bootstrap support. Monophyly of <i>Ulvella leptochaete</i> was obvious in both of our phylogenetic analyses. With this first report of epi-endophytic algae from Indian territorial waters, the dire need to catalogue its cryptic diversity is highlighted and avenues of future research are discussed.</p>

				<title><i>Lantana camara</i> L. (Verbenaceae) invasion along streams in a heterogeneous landscape</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0717-0726</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Streams are periodically disturbed due to flooding, act as edges between habitats and also facilitate the dispersal of propagules, thus being potentially more vulnerable to invasions than adjoining regions. We used a landscape-wide transect-based sampling strategy and a mixed effects modelling approach to understand the effects of distance from stream, a rainfall gradient, light availability and fire history on the distribution of the invasive shrub <i>Lantana camara</i> L.(lantana) in the tropical dry forests of Mudumalai in southern India. The area occupied by lantana thickets and lantana stem abundance were both found to be highest closest to streams across this landscape with a rainfall gradient. There was no advantage in terms of increased abundance or area occupied by lantana when it grew closer to streams in drier areas as compared to moister areas. On an average, the area covered by lantana increased with increasing annual rainfall. Areas that experienced greater number of fires during 1989–2010 had lower lantana stem abundance irrespective of distance from streams. In this landscape, total light availability did not affect lantana abundance. Understanding the spatially variable environmental factors in a heterogeneous landscape influencing the distribution of lantana would aid in making informed management decisions at this scale.</p>

				<title>Does malaria epidemiology project Cameroon as `Africa in miniature'?</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0727-0738</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cameroon, a west-central African country with a &#8764;20 million population, is commonly regarded as ‘Africa in miniature’ due to the extensive biological and cultural diversities of whole Africa being present in a single-country setting. This country is inhabited by ancestral human lineages in unique eco-climatic conditions and diverse topography. Over 90% Cameroonians are at risk of malaria infection, and &#8764;41% have at least one episode of malaria each year. Historically, the rate of malaria infection in Cameroon has fluctuated over the years; the number of cases was about 2 million in 2010 and 2011. The Cameroonian malaria control programme faces an uphill task due to high prevalence of multidrug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant malaria vectors. Above all, continued human migration from the rural to urban areas as well as population exchange with adjoining countries, high rate of ecological instabilities caused by deforestation, poor housing, lack of proper sanitation and drainage system might have resulted in the recent increase in incidences of malaria and other vector-borne diseases in Cameroon. The available data on eco-environmental variability and intricate malaria epidemiology in Cameroon reflect the situation in the whole of Africa, and warrant the need for in-depth study by using modern surveillance tools for meaningful basic understanding of the malaria triangle (host-parasite-vector-environment).</p>

				<title>Phosphorylation of DegU is essential for activation of <i>amyE</i> expression in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i></title>
				<feature>Brief communications</feature>
				<page>0747-0752</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Alpha (𝛼)-amylase (<i>amyE</i>) is one of the major exo-enzymes secreted by <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> during the post-exponential phase. The DegS-DegU two-component system regulates expression of majority of post-exponentially expressed genes in <i>B. subtilis</i>. It has been demonstrated that varying levels of the phosphorylated form of DegU (DegU-P) control different cellular processes. Exo-protease production is observed when effective concentration of DegU-P rises in the cell, whereas swarming motility is favoured at very low amounts of DegU-P. In this study we show that like other exo-proteases, expression of <i>amyE</i> is positively regulated by increase in DegU-P levels in the cell. We also demonstrate that residues at the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif of DegU are necessary for the <i>amyE</i> expression. This observation is further reinforced by demonstrating the direct interaction of DegU on <i>amyE</i> promoter.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction to soil drying was evaluated in two <i>Triticum aestivum</i> near-isogenic lines carrying different alleles of the height-reducing gene <i>Rht-B1</i> based on an improved method for assessment of electrolyte leakage. The two lines were previously shown to differ in their physiological responses to induced water deficit stress. Drought was imposed for 6 days on 10-day-old seedlings. Ion efflux from leaves was measured conductometrically in multiple time points during the 24 h incubation period, and the obtained biphasic kinetics was interpreted according to a previously developed theoretical model proposing different leakage rates through the apoplast and the symplast. Most of the model parameters were able to properly differentiate the two closely related genotypes. The mutant <i>Rht-B1c</i> displayed lower and slower electrolyte leakage in comparison with the wild-type <i>Rht-B1a</i>. It was speculated that the <i>Rht</i> genes expressing defective DELLA proteins might be involved in water stress response through modulation of cell wall stiffness, which influences its capacity for ions retention, and also by their contribution to ROS detoxification, thus indirectly stabilizing cellular membranes. The presented analytical approach relating processes of ion and water flow in and out of the cell could be used for characterization of membrane and cell wall properties of different genotypes under normal and stress conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum chemical calculations were carried out to study the electronic structure and stability of adenine–thymine and the rare tautomer of adenine–thymine base pairs along with their Cu<sup>2+</sup> complexes and their interactions with AlN-modified fullerene (C<sub>58</sub>AlN) using Density Functional Theory (B3LYP method). Since, these two forms of base pairs and their Cu<sup>2+</sup> complexes have almost similar electronic structures, their chemical differentiation is an extremely difficult task. In this investigation, we have observed that AlN-doped C<sub>60</sub> could be used as a potentially viable nanoscale sensor to detect these two base pairs as well as their Cu<sup>2+</sup> complexes.</p>

				<title>Identification and <i>in silico</i> analysis of helical lipid binding regions in proteins belonging to the amphitropic protein family</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0771-0783</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of protein–lipid interactions is increasingly recognized to be of importance in numerous biological processes. Bioinformatics is being increasingly used as a helpful tool in studying protein–lipid interactions. Especially recently developed approaches recognizing lipid binding regions in proteins can be implemented. In this study one of those bioinformatics approaches specialized in identifying lipid binding helical regions in proteins is expanded. The approach is explored further by features which can be easily obtained manually. Some interesting examples of members of the amphitropic protein family have been investigated in order to demonstrate the additional features of this bioinformatics approach. The results in this study seem to indicate interesting characteristics of amphitropic proteins and provide insight into the mechanistic functioning and overall understanding of this intriguing class of proteins. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the presented bioinformatics approach might be either an interesting starting point in protein–lipid interactions studies or a good tool for selecting new focus points for more detailed experimental research of proteins with known overall protein–lipid binding abilities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Ulocladium atrum</i> inulinase was immobilized on different composite membranes composed of chitosan/nonwoven fabrics. Km values of free and immobilized <i>U. atrum</i> inulinase on different composite membranes were calculated. The enzyme had optimum pH at 5.6 for free and immobilized <i>U. atrum</i> inulinase on polyester nonwoven fabric coated with 3% chitosan solution (PPNWF3), but optimum pH was 5 for immobilized <i>U. atrum</i> inulinase on polyester and polypropylene nonwoven fabrics coated with 1% chitosan solution. The enzyme had optimum temperature at 40&#176;C for immobilized enzyme on each of polyester and polypropylene composite membranes coated with 1% chitosan, while it was 50&#176;C for free and immobilized enzyme on polypropylene nonwoven fabric coated with 3% chitosan solution. Free <i>U. atrum</i> inulinase was stable at 40&#176;C but thermal stability of the immobilized enzyme was detected up to 60&#176;C. Reusability of immobilized enzyme was from 38 to 42 cycles of reuse; after this, the immobilized enzyme lost its activity completely. In conclusion, immobilized <i>U. atrum</i> inulinase was considerably more stable than the free enzyme, and could be stored for extended periods.</p>

				<title>LNA-modified isothermal oligonucleotide microarray for differentiating bacilli of similar origin</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0795-0804</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oligonucleotide microarray has been one of the most powerful tools in the ‘Post-Genome Era’ for its high sensitivity, high throughput and parallel processing capability. To achieve high detection specificity, we fabricated an isothermal microarray using locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotide probes, since LNA has demonstrated the advanced ability to enhance the binding affinity toward their complementary nucleotides. After designing the nucleotide sequences of these oligonucleotide probes for gram-positive bacilli of similar origin (<i>Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus megaterium</i> and <i>Bacillus circulans</i>), we unified the melting temperatures of these oligonucleotide probes by modifying some nucleotides using LNA. Furthermore, we optimized the experimental procedures of hydrating microarray slides, blocking side surface as well as labelling the PCR products. Experimental results revealed that <i>KOD Dash</i> DNA polymerase could efficiently incorporate Cy3-dCTP into the PCR products, and the LNA-isothermal oligonucleotide microarray were able to distinguish the bacilli of similar origin with a high degree of accuracy and specificity under the optimized experimental condition.</p>

				<title>Isolation of a novel uric-acid-degrading microbe <i>Comamonas sp.</i> BT UA and rapid biosensing of uric acid from extracted uricase enzyme</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0805-0819</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Uric-acid-utilizing soil bacteria were isolated, and 16s rRNA sequence was studied for strain identification. The most prominent uricase-producing bacterium was identified as <i>Comamonas</i> sp BT UA. Crude enzyme was extracted, freeze-dried and its K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> were determined as 40 𝜇M and 0.047 𝜇M min<sup>−1</sup>ml<sup>−1</sup> using Line-weaver Burke plot. An activity of 80 U/mg of total protein was observed when cultured at 37&#176;C for 84 h at pH 7. The purified enzyme was used to measure uric acid by spectrophotometric method and electrochemical biosensor. In the biosensing system the enzyme was immobilized on the platinum electrode with a biodegradable glutaraldehyde-crosslinked gelatin film having a swelling percentage of 109&#177;3.08, and response was observed by amperometry applying fixed potential. The electrochemical process as obtained by the anodic peak current and scan rate relationship was further configured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The polymer matrix on the working electrode gave capacitive response for the electrode–electrolyte interaction. The sensitivity of the biosensor was measured as 6.93 𝜇A𝜇M<sup>−1</sup> with a sensor affinity [𝐾<sub>m(app)</sub>] of 50 𝜇M and 95% reproducibility after 50 measurements. The spectrophotometric method could be used in the range of 6–1000 𝜇M, whereas the biosensor generated linear response in the 1.5–1000 𝜇M range with a response time of 24 s and limit of detection of 0.56 𝜇M. Uric acid was estimated in human blood samples by the biosensor and satisfactory results were obtained.</p>

				<title>Modulation of phagolysosome maturation by bacterial <i>tlyA</i> gene product</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0821-0834</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pathogenic traits of TlyA proteins of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> are not known. Expressions of TlyA in bacteria that do not express endogenous TlyA adhere better to RAW264.7 macrophages and get phagocytosed efficiently. The internalized bacteria avoid acidification to the extent of &#62; 65% in the case of both TlyA-expressing <i>E. coli</i> and <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Consistent with this observation, we have observed decreased co-localizaton of Lysosomal Membrane Associated Protein-1 (&#8764;35%), Early Endosomal Antigen-1 (&#8764;34%), Rab5 (&#8764;30%) and Rab7 (&#8764;35%) and enhanced colocalizaton of Rab14 (&#8764;80%) on both TlyA-expressing bacteria as well as on TlyA-coated latex beads. These results suggest that the mycobacterial TlyA, in general, can modulate phagolysosome maturation pathway immediately after entry into macrophages, while other important molecules may aid the bacterium for long-term, intracellular survival at later point of time.</p>

				<title>Effects of nitric oxide modulating activities on development of enteric nervous system mediated gut motility in chick embryo model</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0835-0848</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The enteric nervous system (ENS) arises from the enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCCs), and many molecules and biochemical processes may be involved in its development. This study examined the effects of modulating embryonic nitric oxide (NO) activity on the intestinal motility induced by ENS. One-hundred-and-twenty fertilized chicken eggs were assigned to three main groups and incubated at 37&#176;C and 60% humidity. The eggs were treated with 𝑁<sup>𝐺</sup>-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), L-arginine (L-Arg) or vehicle from days 3 (1st group), 7 (2nd group) and 10 (3rd group) of incubation and continued up to day 18. On day 19, the embryos were sacrificed, the jejunal and colorectal segments were taken and the intestinal motility was assessed using isolated organ system. The intestinal motility was recorded normally and following cholinergic, adrenergic and non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) stimulations. The ENS structure was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Rhythmic intestinal contractions were seen in all treatment groups, but inhibition of NO in the L-NAME-treated embryos caused significant decrease (𝑝 &#60; 0.01) in the frequency and amplitude of the contraction. The responsiveness to adrenergic, cholinergic and NANC stimulations was also significantly decreased (𝑝  &#60;0.05). The GFAP expression was significantly (𝑝 &#60; 0.05) reduced in the L-NAME-treated embryos. This study showed that the inhibition of NO caused a deficient development of the ENS, leading to a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of the intestinal contractions and reduced the responsiveness to adrenergic, cholinergic and NANC signalling.</p>

				<title>Recombination-activating gene 1 and 2 (<i>RAG1</i> and <i>RAG2</i>) in flounder (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>)</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0849-0858</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the development of B and T lymphocytes, <i>Ig</i> and <i>TCR</i> variable region genes are assembled from germline V, D, and J gene segments by a site-specific recombination reaction known as V(D)J recombination. The process of somatic V(D)J recombination, mediated by the recombination-activating gene (<i>RAG</i>) products, is the most significant characteristic of adaptive immunity in jawed vertebrates. Flounder (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>) <i>RAG1</i> and <i>RAG2</i> were isolated by Genome Walker and RT-PCR, and their expression patterns were analysed by RT-PCR and <i>in situ</i> hybridization on sections. <i>RAG1</i> spans over 7.0 kb, containing 4 exons and 3 introns, and the full-length ORF is 3207 bp, encoding a peptide of 1068 amino acids. The first exon lies in the 5&#8242;-UTR, which is an alternative exon. <i>RAG2</i> full-length ORF is 1062 bp, encodes a peptide of 533 amino acids, and lacks introns in the coding region. In 6-month-old flounders, the expression of <i>RAG1</i> and <i>RAG2</i> was essentially restricted to the pronephros (head kidney) and mesonephros (truck kidney). Additionally, both of them were mainly expressed in the thymus. These results revealed that the thymus and kidney most likely serve as the primary lymphoid tissues in the flounder.</p>

				<title>Prooxidative effects of aspartame on antioxidant defense status in erythrocytes of rats</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0859-0866</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Since aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, ASP) is one of the most widely used artificial sweeteners, the aim of the present study was to investigate its effects on serum glucose and lipid levels as well as its effects on oxidative/antioxidative status in erythrocytes of rats. The experiment included two groups of animals: the control group was administered with water only, while the experimental group was orally administered with ASP (40 mg/kg b.w.) daily, for a period of six weeks. When compared with the control group, the group administrated with ASP indicated higher values of serum glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Significantly increased concentrations of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), peroxynitrite (ОNОО<sup>−</sup>) and lipid peroxides (LPO) were recorded in the erythrocytes of ASP treated group in comparison to the control group. In the course of chronic ASP administration, the following was observed: the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activity of catalase (CAT) increased. Thus, these findings suggest that long-term consumption of ASP leads to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, as well as to oxidative stress in erythrocytes.</p>

				<title>Uncoupling protein 2 gene (<i>UCP2</i>) 45-bp I/D polymorphism is associated with adiposity among Malaysian women</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0867-0875</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigated the association of Uncoupling Protein 2 gene (<i>UCP2</i>) 45-bp I/D polymorphism with obesity and adiposity in 926 Malaysian subjects (416 males; 265 obese; 102/672/152 Malays/Chinese/Indians). The overall minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.14, while MAFs according to Malay/Chinese/Indian were 0.17/0.12/0.21. The polymorphism was associated with ethnicity, obesity and overall adiposity (total body fat percentage, TBF), but not gender and central adiposity (waist–hip ratio, WHR). Gender- and ethnicity-stratified analysis revealed that within males, the polymorphism was not associated with ethnicity and anthropometric classes. However, within females, significantly more Indians, obese and those with high TBF carried I allele. Logistic regression analysis among females further showed the polymorphism was associated with obesity and overall adiposity; however, when adjusted for age and ethnicity, this association was abolished for obesity but remained significant for overall adiposity [Odds Ratio (OR) for ID genotype =2.02 (CI=1.18, 3.45; 𝑝=0.01); I allele =1.81 (CI=1.15, 2.84; 𝑝=0.01)]. Indeed, covariate analysis controlling for age and ethnicity also showed that those carrying ID genotype or I allele had significantly higher TBF than the rest. In conclusion, <i>UCP2</i> 45-bp I/D polymorphism is associated with overall adiposity among Malaysian women.</p>

				<title>Interrelationships between <i>Bacillus</i> sp. CHEP5 and <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp. SEMIA6144 in the induced systemic resistance against <i>Sclerotium rolfsii</i> and symbiosis on peanut plants</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0877-0885</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plant-growth-promoting bacteria are often used to enhance crop yield and for biological control of phytopathogens. <i>Bacillus</i> sp. CHEP5 is a biocontrol agent that induces systemic resistance (ISR) in <i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L. (peanut) against <i>Sclerotium rolfsii</i>, the causal agent of root and stem wilt. In this work, the effect of the co-inoculation of <i>Bacillus</i> sp. CHEP5 and the peanut nodulating strain <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp. SEMIA 6144 was studied on induction of both systemic resistance and nodulation processes. <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp. SEMIA 6144 did not affect the ability of <i>Bacillus</i> sp. CHEP5 to protect peanut plants from <i>S. rolfsii</i> by ISR and the priming in challenged-plants, as evidenced by an increment in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme activity. Additionally, the capacity of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp. SEMIA 6144 to induce nodule formation in pathogen-challenged plants was improved by the presence of <i>Bacillus</i> sp. CHEP5.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Apetala2/Ethylene Response Factors (AP2/ERF) play important roles in regulating gene expression under abiotic and biotic stress in the plant kingdom. Here, we isolated a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factors, <i>NtERF1-1</i>, from <i>Nicotiana tabcum cv</i>. Xanthi NN carrying the <i>N gene</i>, which is resistant to <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> (TMV). <i>NtERF1-1</i> encoded a putative protein of 229 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 24.58 kDa. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that <i>NtERF1-1</i> contained a conserved DNA-binding domain at the N-terminal. Comparison of amino acid sequences revealed that NtERF1-1 possessed high similarities to ERFs from diverse plants. Semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses indicated that <i>NtERF1-1</i> was up-regulated following TMV infection. In addition, we speculated that <i>NtERF1-1</i> might participate in the signal transduction pathway of defence response inducted by the interaction between the 𝑁 gene and TMV.</p>

				<title>Evolution and expression analysis of the soybean glutamate decarboxylase gene family</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0899-0907</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of L-glutamate into 𝛾-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a four-carbon non-protein amino acid present in all organisms. Although plant GAD plays important roles in GABA biosynthesis, our knowledge concerning <i>GAD</i> gene family members and their evolutionary relationship remains limited. Therefore, in this study, we have analysed the evolutionary mechanisms of soybean <i>GAD</i> genes and suggested that these genes expanded in the soybean genome partly due to segmental duplication events. The approximate dates of duplication events were calculated using the synonymous substitution rate, and we suggested that the segmental duplication of <i>GAD</i> genes in soybean originated 9.47 to 11.84 million years ago (Mya). In addition, all segmental duplication pairs (<i>GmGAD1/3</i> and <i>GmGAD2/4</i>) are subject to purifying selection. Furthermore, <i>GmGAD</i> genes displayed differential expression either in their transcript abundance or in their expression patterns under abiotic stress conditions like salt, drought, and cold. The expression pattern of paralogous pairs suggested that they might have undergone neofunctionalization during the subsequent evolution process. Taken together, our results provide valuable information for the evolution of the <i>GAD</i> gene family and represent the basis for future research on the functional characterization of <i>GAD</i> genes in higher plants.</p>

				<title>Caspase-like proteins: <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> metacaspase and <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> paracaspase, what are their functions?</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0909-0916</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Caspases are cysteine proteases that are important regulators of programmed cell death in animals. Two novel relatives to members of the caspase families metacaspases and paracaspase have been discovered. Metacaspase type-1 was identified in <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i>, an opportunistic protozoan parasite that causes severe diseases in humans. Paracaspase was found in the non-pathogenic protozoan <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>. Since their discovery in <i>Acanthamoeba</i> and <i>Dictyostelium</i>, metacaspases and paracaspases have remained poorly characterized. At present we do not have sufficient data about the molecular function of these caspase-like proteins or their role, if any, in programmed cell death. How these caspase proteins function at the molecular level is an important area of study that will provide insight into their potential for treatment therapies against <i>Acanthamoeba</i> infection and other similar parasitic protozoan. Additionally, finding the molecular functions of these caspase-like proteins will provide information concerning their role in more complex organisms.The aim of this article was to review recent discoveries about metacaspases and paracaspases as regulators of apoptotic and non-apoptotic processes.</p>

				<title>Functional genomics of tomato: Opportunities and challenges in post-genome NGS era</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0917-0929</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Tomato Genome Sequencing Project represented a landmark venture in the history of sequencing projects where both Sanger’s and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were employed, and a highly accurate and one of the best assembled plant genomes along with a draft of the wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, were released in 2012. However, the functional potential of the major portion of this newly generated resource is still undefined. The very first challenge before scientists working on tomato functional biology is to exploit this high-quality reference sequence for tapping of the wealth of genetic variants for improving agronomic traits in cultivated tomatoes. The sequence data generated recently by 150 Tomato Genome Consortium would further uncover the natural alleles present in different tomato genotypes. Therefore, we found it relevant to have a fresh outlook on tomato functional genomics in the context of application of NGS technologies in its post-genome sequencing phase. Herein, we provide an overview how NGS technologies vis-à-vis available reference sequence have assisted each other for their mutual improvement and how their combined use could further facilitate the development of other ‘omics’ tools, required to propel the Solanaceae research. Additionally, we highlight the challenges associated with the application of these cutting-edge technologies.</p>

				<title>Antifreeze proteins enable plants to survive in freezing conditions</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0931-0944</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Overwintering plants secrete antifreeze proteins (AFPs) to provide freezing tolerance. These proteins bind to and inhibit the growth of ice crystals that are formed in the apoplast during subzero temperatures. Antifreeze activity has been detected in more than 60 plants and AFPs have been purified from 15 of these, including gymnosperms, dicots and monocots. Biochemical characterization of plant antifreeze activity, as determined by the high ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activities and low thermal hysteresis (TH) of AFPs, showed that their main function is inhibition of ice crystal growth rather than the lowering of freezing temperatures. However, recent studies showed that antifreeze activity with higher TH also exists in plants. Calcium and hormones like ethylene and jasmonic acid have been shown to regulate plant antifreeze activity. Recent studies have shown that plant AFPs bind to both prism planes and basal planes of ice crystals by means of two flat ice binding sites. Plant AFPs have been postulated to evolve from the <i>OsLRR-PSR</i> gene nearly 36 million years ago. In this review, we present the current scenario of plant AFP research in order to understand the possible potential of plant AFPs in generation of freezing-tolerant crops.</p>

				<title>Lack of IL-6 increases blood–brain barrier permeability in fungal meningitis</title>
				<feature>Brief communication</feature>
				<page>0007-0012</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pathogenesis of increased blood–brain barrier permeability during <i>Cryptococcus</i> meningitis is still largely unknown. Interleukin (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine, and numerous studies have shown that IL‐6 influences the integrity of the blood–brain barrier. In this study we investigated the role of IL-6 in <i>Cryptococcus</i> meningitis. First, wild-type or IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice were injected with <i>Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans)</i> and the survival time in both groups was recorded. Second, the number of fungi was measured in the brains of IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> wild-type mice. Finally, the blood–brain barrier permeability index was detected in infected IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice treated with recombinant human IL-6. The blood–brain barrier permeability index was measured in infected wild-type mice treated with anti-IL-6 antibodies as well. The survival of IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice injected with <i>C. neoformans</i> was significantly lower than that of identically challenged wild-type mice. The infected IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice had significantly larger brain fungal burdens than wild-type mice. Furthermore, increased blood–brain barrier index was found in infected IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice when compared with that in infected control mice. Similar results were obtained when mice challenged with <i>C. neoformans</i> were treated systemically with neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibodies, resulting in an elevation of vascular permeability. Our data revealed that IL-6 reduced the blood–brain barrier permeability during <i>Cryptococcus</i> meningitis, and it might provide an explanation for the significantly lower survival of infected IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>

				<page>0013-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Structures of crystals of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> RecA, grown and analysed under different conditions, provide insights into hitherto underappreciated details of molecular structure and plasticity. In particular, they yield information on the invariant and variable features of the geometry of the P-loop, whose binding to ATP is central for all the biochemical activities of RecA. The strengths of interaction of the ligands with the P-loop reveal significant differences. This in turn affects the magnitude of the motion of the `switch’ residue, Gln195 in <i>M. tuberculosis</i> RecA, which triggers the transmission of ATP-mediated allosteric information to the DNA binding region. <i>M. tuberculosis</i> RecA is substantially rigid compared with its counterparts from <i>M. smegmatis</i> and <i>E. coli</i>, which exhibit concerted internal molecular mobility. The interspecies variability in the plasticity of the two mycobacterial proteins is particularly surprising as they have similar sequence and 3D structure. Details of the interactions of ligands with the protein, characterized in the structures reported here, could be useful for design of inhibitors against <i>M. tuberculosis</i> RecA.</p>

				<title>Biochemical characterization of blood plasma of coronary artery disease patients by <i>in vitro</i> high-resolution proton NMR spectroscopy</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0031-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study aimed to investigate the biochemical profile of blood plasma of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and angiographically normal subjects (controls) to determine biomarkers for their differentiation. In this double blind study, 5 mL venous blood was drawn before angiography from CAD patients (n=60) and controls (n=13) comprising angiography normal individuals. <i>In vitro</i> high-resolution NMR spectroscopy of these blood plasma samples was carried out at 400 MHz, and intensity data were analysed with partial least square discriminant analysis. Categorization of subjects as controls or CAD patients and the patients further as single vessel disease (SVD), double vessel disease (DVD) and triple vessel disease (TVD) was done at the end of the study based on their angiography reports. Raised levels of lipids, alanine (Ala) and isoleucine/leucine/valine (Ile/Leu/Val) were observed in CAD patients compared with controls. Partial least square discriminant analysis showed separation between controls <i>vs</i> CAD patients. TVD patients showed increased levels of Ile/Leu/Val and Ala compared with controls and SVD. Alanine, Ile/Leu/Val, and LDL/VLDL appear as possible biomarkers for distinguishing between controls and patients with SVD and TVD. A metabolic adaptation of myocardium may play a role in raising the Ala level.</p>

				<title>BARF1 gene silencing triggers caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in Epstein-Barr virus-positive malignant cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0041-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded BARF1 (BamH1-A Rightward Frame-1) is expressed in EBV-positive malignancies such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, EBV-associated gastric cancer, B-cell lymphoma and nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and has been shown to have an important role in oncogenesis. However, the mechanism by which BARF1 elicits its biological effects is unclear. We investigated the effects of BARF1 silencing on cell proliferation and apoptosis in EBV-positive malignant cells. We observed that BARF1 silencing significantly inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis-mediated cell death by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential in AG876 and Hone-Akata cells. BARF1 knockdown up-regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and down-regulates the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. In BARF1-down-regulated cells, the Bcl-2/BAX ratio is decreased. The caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was found to rescue siBARF1-induced apoptosis in these cells. Immunoblot analysis showed significant increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9. We observed a significant increase in cytochrome c level as well as the formation of apoptosome complex in BARF1-silenced cells. In conclusion, siRNA-mediated BARF1 down-regulation induces caspase-dependent apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway through modulation of Bcl-2/BAX ratio in AG876 and Hone-Akata cells. Targeting BARF1 using siRNA has the potential to be developed as a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies.</p>

				<title>Effects of Sunphenon and Polyphenon 60 on proteolytic pathways, inflammatory cytokines and myogenic markers in H<sub>2</sub>𝑂<sub>2</sub>-treated C2C12 cells</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of Sunphenon and Polyphenon 60 in oxidative stress response, myogenic regulatory factors, inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic and proteolytic pathways on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced myotube atrophy was addressed. Cellular responses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced C2C12cells were examined, including mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors, such as MyoD and myogenin, inflammatory pathways, such as TNF-𝛼 and NF-kB, as well as proteolytic enzymes, such as 𝜇-calpain and m-calpain. The pre-treatment of Sunphenon (50 𝜇g/mL)/Polyphenon 60 (50 𝜇g/mL) on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated C2C12 cells significantly down-regulated the mRNA expression of myogenin and MyoD when compared to those treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced alone. Additionally, the mRNA expression of 𝜇-calpain and m-calpain were significantly (𝑝 &#60; 0.05) increased in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated C2C12 cells, whereas pre-treatment with Sunphenon/Polyphenon significantly down-regulated the above genes, namely 𝜇-calpain and m-calpain. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of TNF-𝛼 and NF-kB were significantly increased in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated C2C12 cells, while pre-treatment with Sunphenon (50 𝜇g/mL)/Polyphenon 60 (50 𝜇g/mL) significantly (𝑝 &#60; 0.05) down-regulated it when compared to the untreated control group. Subsequent analysis of DNA degeneration and caspase activation revealed that Sunphenon (50 𝜇g/mL)/Polyphenon 60 (50 𝜇g/mL) inhibited activation of caspase-3 and showed an inhibitory effect on DNA degradation. From this result, we know that, in stress conditions, 𝜇-calpain may be involved in the muscle atrophy through the suppression of myogenin and MyoD. Moreover, Sunphenon may regulate the skeletal muscle genes/promote skeletal muscle recovery by the up-regulation of myogenin and MyoD and suppression of 𝜇-calpain and inflammatory pathways and may regulate the apoptosis pathways. Our findings suggest that dietary supplementation of Sunphenon might reduce inflammatory events in muscle-associated diseases, such as myotube atrophy.</p>

				<title>Human platelet releasates combined with polyglycolic acid scaffold promote chondrocyte differentiation and phenotypic maintenance</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0061-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate the differentiating properties of platelet-rich plasma releasates (PRPr) on human chondrocytes seeded on a polygtlycolic acid (PGA) 3D scaffold. Gene expression and biochemical analysis were carried out to assess the improved quality of our PGA-based cartilage constructs supplemented with PRPr. We observed that the use of PRPr as cell cultures supplementation to PGA-chondrocyte constructs may promote chondrocyte differentiation, and thus may contribute to maintaining the chondrogenic phenotype longer than conventional supplementation by increasing high levels of important chondrogenic markers (e.g. sox9, aggrecan and type II collagen), without induction of type I collagen. Moreover, our constructs were analysed for the secretion and deposition of important ECM molecules (sGAG, type II collagen, etc.). Our results indicate that PRPr supplementation may synergize with PGA-based scaffolds to stimulate human articular chondrocyte differentiation, maturation and phenotypic maintenance.</p>

				<title>Collagen I-induced dendritic cells activation is regulated by TNF-𝛼 production through down-regulation of <i>IRF4</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0071-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Previously we have shown that collagen I enhances the maturation and function of dendritic cells (DCs). Inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-𝛼, interleukin (IL)-1𝛽 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are also known to activate DCs. Here we investigated the involvement of TNF-𝛼 on the collagen I-induced DCs activation. TNF-a neutralization inhibited collagen I-induced IL-12 secretions by DCs. Additionally, we observed suppression of collagen I-induced costimulatory molecules expression along with down-regulation of genes involved in DCs activation pathway. Furthermore, TNF-𝛼 inhibition upon collagen Istimulation up-regulated the expression of interferon regulatory transcription factor <i>IRF4</i>, when compared to collagen I only treated cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that collagen I induce TNF-𝛼 production, which is crucial for the activation and function of DCs, through down-regulation of <i>IRF4</i>, and implicates the importance in development of anti- TNF-𝛼 therapeutics for several inflammatory diseases.</p>

				<title>Co-expression of the C-terminal domain of <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> invasin enhances the efficacy of classical swine-fever-vectored vaccine based on human adenovirus</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0079-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The use of adenovirus vector-based vaccines is a promising approach for generating antigen-specific immune responses. Improving vaccine potency is necessary in other approaches to address their inadequate protection for the majority of infectious diseases. This study is the first to reconstruct a recombinant replication-defective human adenovirus co-expressing E2 and invasin C-terminal (InvC) glycoproteins (rAd-E2-InvC). rAd-E2-InvC with 2&#215;10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> was intramuscularly administered two times to CSFV-free pigs at 14 day intervals. No adverse clinical reactions were observed in any of the pigs after the vaccination. The CSFV E2-specific antibody titer was significantly higher in the rAd-E2-InvC group than that in the rAdV-E2 group as measured by NPLA and blocking ELISA. Pigs immunized with rAd-E2-InvC were completely protected against lethal challenge. Neither CSFV RNA nor pathological changes were detected in the tissues after CSFV challenge. These results demonstrate that rAd-E2-InvC could be an alternative to the existing CSF vaccine. Moreover, InvC that acts as an adjuvant could enhance the immunogenicity of rAdV-E2 and induce high CSFV E2-specific antibody titer and protection level.</p>

				<title>Circulating nucleic acids damage DNA of healthy cells by integrating into their genomes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0091-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Whether nucleic acids that circulate in blood have any patho-physiological functions in the host have not been explored. We report here that far from being inert molecules, circulating nucleic acids have significant biological activities of their own that are deleterious to healthy cells of the body. Fragmented DNA and chromatin (DNAfs and Cfs) isolated from blood of cancer patients and healthy volunteers are readily taken up by a variety of cells in culture to be localized in their nuclei within a few minutes. The intra-nuclear DNAfs and Cfs associate themselves with host cell chromosomes to evoke a cellular DNA-damage-repair-response (DDR) followed by their incorporation into the host cell genomes. Whole genome sequencing detected the presence of tens of thousands of human sequence reads in the recipient mouse cells. Genomic incorporation of DNAfs and Cfs leads to dsDNA breaks and activation of apoptotic pathways in the treated cells. When injected intravenously into Balb/C mice, DNAfs and Cfs undergo genomic integration into cells of their vital organs resulting in activation of DDR and apoptotic proteins in the recipient cells. Cfs have significantly greater activity than DNAfs with respect to all parameters examined, while both DNAfs and Cfs isolated from cancer patients are more active than those from normal volunteers. All the above pathological actions of DNAfs and Cfs described above can be abrogated by concurrent treatment with DNase I and/or anti-histone antibody complexed nanoparticles both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Taken together, our results that circulating DNAfs and Cfs are physiological, continuously arising, endogenous DNA damaging agents with implications to ageing and a multitude of human pathologies including initiation of cancer.</p>

				<page>0113-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We here present the first whole genome analysis of an anonymous Kinh Vietnamese (KHV) trio whose genomes were deeply sequenced to 30-fold average coverage. The resulting short reads covered 99.91% of the human reference genome (GRCh37d5). We identified 4,719,412 SNPs and 827,385 short indels that satisfied the Mendelian inheritance law. Among them, 109,914 (2.3%) SNPs and 59,119 (7.1%) short indels were novel. We also detected 30,171 structural variants of which 27,604 (91.5%) were large indels. There were 6,681 large indels in the range 0.1–100 kbp occurring in the child genome that were also confirmed in either the father or mother genome.We compared these large indels against the DGV database and found that 1,499 (22.44%) were KHV specific. <i>De novo</i> assembly of high-quality unmapped reads yielded 789 contigs with the length &#8805; 300 bp. There were 235 contigs from the child genome of which 199 (84.7%) were significantly matched with at least one contig from the father or mother genome. Blasting these 199 contigs against other alternative human genomes revealed 4 novel contigs. The novel variants identified from our study demonstrated the necessity of conducting more genome-wide studies not only for Kinh but also for other ethnic groups in Vietnam.</p>

				<title>BDP-30, a systemic resistance inducer from <i>Boerhaavia diffusa</i> L., suppresses TMV infection, and displays homology with ribosome- inactivating proteins</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0125-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Root extract of <i>Boerhaavia diffusa</i> L. induced systemic resistance in tobacco against <i>Tobacco mosaic</i> virus. A 30 kDa protein was isolated as the active component, called BDP-30 on the basis of the molecular weight and source plant. BDP-30, a glycoprotein, was found to be temperature and protease resistant. It was basic, possessing a pI greater than 9.0. In-gel proteolytic digestion of BDP-30 generated two peptides that possessed the amino acid sequence KLYDIPPLR and KVTLPYSGNYER by LC/MS/MS. Both peptides shared absolute sequence identity with trichosanthin, a ribosome-inactivating protein from <i>Trichosanthes kirilowii</i>, and a 78% and 100% homology respectively with an RIP from <i>Bryonia dioica</i>, bryodin. Further, effort was made to look at the fate of TMV in induced resistant <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cv. Xanthi, a systemic host of the virus, at specified days after inoculation in control and treated plants. TMV coat protein (CP) was detected by immunoblot 7 days post inoculation up to 21 days in the control set, but not in treated resistant plants. TMV RNA was detected by RT-PCR using TMV-CP specific primers. Resistant tobacco did not show presence of TMV RNA up to 21 days of inoculation. This suggests that BDP-30 may be suppressing TMV replication.</p>

				<title>Identification of plant defence regulators through transcriptional profiling of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana cdd1</i> mutant</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0137-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A sustainable balance between defence and growth is essential for optimal fitness under pathogen stress. Plants activate immune response at the cost of normal metabolic requirements. Thus, plants that constitutively activate defence are deprived of growth. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutant <i>constitutive defence without defect in growth and development1</i> (<i>cdd1</i>) is an exception. The <i>cdd1</i> mutant is constitutive for salicylic acid accumulation, signalling, and defence against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, without having much impact on growth. Thus, <i>cdd1</i> offers an ideal genetic background to identify novel regulators of plant defence. Here we report the differential gene expression profile between <i>cdd1</i> and wild-type plants as obtained by microarray hybridization. Expression of several defence-related genes also supports constitutive activation of defence in <i>cdd1</i>. We screened T-DNA insertion mutant lines of selected genes, for resistance against virulent bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i> DC3000). Through bacterial resistance, callose deposition and pathogenesis-associated expression analyses, we identified four novel regulators of plant defence. Resistance levels in the mutants suggest that <i>At2g19810</i> and [rom] <i>At5g05790</i> are positive regulators, whereas <i>At1g61370</i> and <i>At3g42790</i> are negative regulators of plant defence against bacterial pathogens.</p>

				<title>Frost hardiness of tree species is independent of phenology and macroclimatic niche</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0147-0157</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The differences in timing in bud burst between species have been interpreted as an adaptation to late frost events in spring. Thus, it has been suggested that the degree of frost susceptibility of leaves is species-specific and depends on the species’ phenology and geographic distribution range. To test for relationships between frost tolerance and phenology as well as between frost tolerance and distribution range across Central European tree species, we studied the frost hardiness of closed buds before bud burst and of freshly opened buds at the time of bud burst. We hypothesized that species with early bud burst and species distributed in eastern and northern areas were more frost tolerant than species with late bud burst and species distributed in western and southern areas. Frost hardiness was estimated by exposing twigs to 11 frost temperatures between −4&#176;C and −80&#176;C and by assessing tissue damage by the electrolyte leakage method. In contrast to our hypotheses, neither frost hardiness of closed buds nor frost hardiness of freshly opened buds were related to any variable describing species’ macroclimatic niche. Furthermore, frost hardiness of freshly opened buds did not differ among species. Thus, the investigated species with early bud burst take higher risks of frost damage than the species with late bud bursts. These findings indicate that frost hardiness might not play the key role in limiting the geographic distribution ranges previously anticipated.</p>

				<title>Stochastic developmental variation, an epigenetic source of phenotypic diversity with far-reaching biological consequences</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0159-0204</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article reviews the production of different phenotypes from the same genotype in the same environment by stochastic cellular events, nonlinear mechanisms during patterning and morphogenesis, and probabilistic self-reinforcing circuitries in the adult life. These aspects of phenotypic variation are summarized under the term‘stochastic developmental variation’ (SDV) in the following. In the past, SDV has been viewed primarily as a nuisance, impairing laboratory experiments, pharmaceutical testing, and true-to-type breeding. This article also emphasizes the positive biological effects of SDV and discusses implications for genotype-to-phenotype mapping, biological individuation, ecology, evolution, and applied biology. There is strong evidence from experiments with genetically identical organisms performed in narrowly standardized laboratory set-ups that SDV is a source of phenotypic variation in its own right aside from genetic variation and environmental variation. It is obviouslymediated bymolecular and higher-order epigeneticmechanisms. Comparison of SDV in animals, plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, archaeans, and viruses suggests that it is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically old phenomenon. In animals, it is usually smallest for morphometric traits and highest for life history traits and behaviour. SDV is thought to contribute to phenotypic diversity in all populations but is particularly relevant for asexually reproducing and genetically impoverished populations, where it generates individuality despite genetic uniformity. In each generation, SDV produces a range of phenotypes around a well-adapted target phenotype, which is interpreted as a bet-hedging strategy to cope with the unpredictability of dynamic environments. At least some manifestations of SDV are heritable, adaptable, selectable, and evolvable, and therefore, SDV may be seen as a hitherto overlooked evolution factor. SDV is also relevant for husbandry, agriculture, and medicine because most pathogens are asexuals that exploit this third source of phenotypic variation tomodify infectivity and resistance to antibiotics. Since SDV affects all types of organisms and almost all aspects of life, it urgently requires more intense research and a better integration into biological thinking.</p>

				<title>siRNAs targeting PB2 and NP genes potentially inhibit replication of <i>Highly Pathogenic</i> H5N1 <i>Avian Influenza Virus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0233-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza</i> (HPAI) H5N1 virus is a threat to animal and public health worldwide. Till date, the H5N1 virus has claimed 402 human lives, with a mortality rate of 58% and has caused the death or culling of millions of poultry since 2003. In this study, we have designed three siRNAs (PB2-2235, PB2-479 and NP-865) targeting PB2 and NP genes of avian influenza virus and evaluated their potential, measured by hemagglutination (HA), plaque reduction and Real time RT-PCR assay, in inhibiting H5N1 virus (A/chicken/Navapur/7972/2006) replication in MDCK cells. The siRNAs caused 8- to 16-fold reduction in virus HA titers at 24 h after challenged with 100TCID<sub>50</sub> of virus. Among these siRNAs, PB2-2235 offered the highest inhibition of virus replication with 16-fold reduction in virus HA titer, 80% reduction in viral plaque counts and 94% inhibition in expression of specific RNA at 24 h. The other two siRNAs had 68–73% and 87–88% reduction in viral plaque counts and RNA copy number, respectively. The effect of siRNA on H5N1 virus replication continued till 48h (maximum observation period). These findings suggest that PB2-2235 could efficiently inhibit HPAI H5N1 virus replication.</p>

				<title>Classification and expression analyses of homeobox genes from <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0241-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Homeobox genes are compared between genomes in an attempt to understand the evolution of animal development. The ability of the protist, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, to shift between uni- and multicellularity makes this group ideal for studying the genetic changes that may have occurred during this transition. We present here the first genome-wide classification and comparative genomic analysis of the 14 homeobox genes present in <i>D. discoideum</i>. Based on the structural alignment of the homeodomains, they can be broadly divided into TALE and non-TALE classes. When individual homeobox genes were compared with members of known class or family, we could further classify them into 3 groups, namely, TALE, OTHER and NOVEL classes, but no HOX family was found. The 5 members of TALE class could be further divided into PBX, PKNOX, IRX and CUP families; 4 homeobox genes classified as NOVEL did not show any similarity to any known homeobox genes; while the remaining 5 were classified as OTHERS as they did show certain degree of similarity to few known homeobox genes. No unique RNA expression pattern during development of <i>D. discoideum</i> emerged for members of an individual group. Putative promoter analysis revealed binding sites for few homeobox transcription factors among many probable factors.</p>

				<title>Riboflavin transporter-2 (<i>rft-2</i>) of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>: Adaptive and developmental regulation</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0257-0268</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Riboflavin transporter (<i>rft-1</i> and <i>rft-2</i>), orthologous to human riboflavin transporter-3 (hR VFT-3), are identified and characterized in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. However, studies pertaining to functional contribution of <i>rft-2</i> in maintaining body homeostatic riboflavin levels and its regulation are very limited. In this study, the expression pattern of <i>rft-2</i> at different life stages of <i>C. elegans</i> was studied through real-time PCR, and found to be consistent from larval to adult stages that demonstrate its involvement in maintaining the body homeostatic riboflavin levels at whole animal level all through its life. A possible regulation of <i>rft-2</i> expression at mRNA levels at whole animal was studied after adaptation to low and high concentrations of riboflavin. Abundance of <i>rft-2</i> transcript was upregulated in riboflavin-deficient conditions (10 nM), while it was downregulated with riboflavin-supplemented conditions (2 mM) as compared with control (10 𝜇M). Further, the 5&#8242;-regulatory region of the <i>rft-2</i> gene was cloned, and transgenic nematodes expressing transcriptional <i>rft-2</i> promoter::<i>GFP</i> fusion constructs were generated. The expression of <i>rft-2</i> was found to be adaptively regulated <i>in vivo</i> when transgenic worms were maintained under different extracellular riboflavin levels, which was also mediated partly via changes in the <i>rft-2</i> levels that directs towards the possible involvement of transcriptional regulatory events.</p>

				<title>Anti-tumour immune effect of oral administration of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> to CT26 tumour-bearing mice</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0269-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer that shows a high mortality and increasing incidence. There are numerous successful treatment options for CRC, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy; however, their side effects and limitations are considerable. Probiotics may be an effective strategy for preventing and inhibiting tumour growth through stimulation of host innate and adaptive immunity. We investigated and compared potential anti-tumour immune responses induced by two isolated <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains, <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> A and <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> b, by pre-inoculating mice with lactobacilli for 14 days. Subsequently, subcutaneous and orthotopic intestinal tumours were generated in the pre-inoculated mice using CT26 murine adenocarcinoma cells and were assessed for response against the tumour. Our results indicated that oral administration with <i>L. plantarum</i> inhibited CT26 cell growth in BALB/c mice and prolonged the survival time of tumour-bearing mice compared with mice administered <i>L. rhamnosus. L. plantarum</i> produced protective immunity against the challenge with CT26 cells by increasing the effector functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration into tumour tissue, up-regulation of IFN-𝛾 (but not IL-4 or IL-17) production, and promotion of Th1-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T differentiation. Consequently, our results suggest that <i>L. plantarum</i> can enhance the anti-tumour immune response and delay tumour formation.</p>

				<title>Suppression of induced but not developmental apoptosis in <i>Drosophila</i> by Ayurvedic <i>Amalaki Rasayana</i> and <i>Rasa-Sindoor</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0281-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earlier we showed formulation-specific beneficial effects of dietary supplement of Ayurvedic <i>Amalaki Rasayana</i> (AR, a herbal formulation) and <i>Rasa-Sindoor</i> (RS, a mercury-based organo-metallic formulation) on various biological parameters in <i>Drosophila</i>, parallel to traditional Ayurvedic literature. These formulations also suppressed cell death and pathology in fly models of neurodegeneration. To understand basis of inhibition of apoptosis, we examined effects of AR and RS on induced and developmental apoptosis in <i>Drosophila</i>. Dietary AR or RS significantly reduced apoptosis induced by <i>GMR-GAL4-, sev-GAL4-</i> or <i>hs-GAL4-</i>directed expression of Rpr, Hid or Grim (RHG) pro-apoptotic proteins or by <i>GMR-GAL4</i>-directed <i>DIAP1-RNAi</i>, resulting in significant restoration of organism's viability and eye morphology. AR or RS supplement enhanced levels of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, DIAP1 and DIAP2, and of Bancal/Hrb57A, while the levels of RHG proteins and of initiator Dronc and effecter Drice caspases were reduced in non-apoptotic wild type as well as in RHG over-expressing tissues. Levels of Dronc or Drice remained unaffected in cells developmentally destined to die so that developmental apoptosis occurred normally. Elevated levels of DIAPs and reduced levels of RHG proteins and caspases reflect a more robust physiological state of AR or RS fed organisms allowing them to tolerate greater insults without triggering the cell-death response. Such homeo-static effects of these Rasayanas seem to contribute to ‘healthy ageing’, one of their effects suggested in traditional Ayurvedic practices.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The elucidation of the organization and maintenance of the plasma membrane has been sought due to its numerous roles in cellular function. In the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, a novel paradigm has begun to emerge in the understanding of the distribution of plasma membrane microdomains and how they are regulated. We aimed to investigate the dynamic interdependence between the protein complexes eisosome and TORC2, representing micro-domains MCC and MCT, respectively. In this study, we reveal that the eisosome organizer Pil1 colocalizes with the MCT marker Avo2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the formation of MCT is dependent on both eisosome integrity and adequate levels of the plasma membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Taken together, our findings indicate that TORC2, eisosomes, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> exist in an interconnected relationship, which supports the emerging model of the plasma membrane.</p>

				<title>Andrographolide suppresses epithelial mesenchymal transition by inhibition of MAPK signalling pathway in lens epithelial cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0313-0324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lens epithelial cells (LECs) may contribute to the development of posterior capsular opacification (PCO), which leads to visual impairment. Andrographolide has been shown to have therapeutic potential against various cancers. However, its effect on human LECs is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of andrographolide on EMT induced by growth factors in the fetal human lens epithelial cell line (FHL 124). Initially the LECs were treated with growth factors (TGF-𝛽2 and bFGF) to induce EMT. Subsequently these EMT-induced cells were treated with andrographolide at 100 and 500 nM concentrations for 24 h. Our results showed that FHL 124 cells treated with growth factors had a significant decrease in protein and m-RNA levels of epithelial markers pax6 and E-Cadherin. After administering andrographolide, these levels significantly increased. It was noticed that EMT markers 𝛼-SMA, fibronectin and collagen IV significantly decreased after treatment with andrographolide when compared to the other group. Treatment with andrographolide significantly inhibited phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Cell cycle analysis showed that andrographolide did not arrest cells at G0/G1 or G2/M at tested concentrations. Our findings suggest that andrographolide helps sustain epithelial characteristics by modulating EMT markers and inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in LECs. Hence it can prove to be useful in curbing EMT-mediated PCO.</p>

				<title>A hypomorphic <i>Cbx3</i> allele causes prenatal growth restriction and perinatal energy homeostasis defects</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0325-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mammals have three HP1 protein isotypes HP1𝛽 (CBX1), HP1𝛾 (CBX3) and HP1𝛼 (CBX5) that are encoded by the corresponding genes <i>Cbx1, Cbx3</i> and <i>Cbx5</i>. Recent work has shown that reduction of CBX3 protein in homozygotes for a hypomorphic allele (<i>Cbx3</i><sup>hypo</sup>) causes a severe postnatal mortality with around 99% of the homozygotes dying before weaning. It is not known what the causes of the postnatal mortality are. Here we show that <i>Cbx3</i><sup>hypo/hypo</sup> conceptuses are significantly reduced in size and the placentas exhibit a haplo-insufficiency. Late gestation <i>Cbx3</i><sup>hypo/hypo</sup> placentas have reduced mRNA transcripts for genes involved in growth regulation, amino acid and glucose transport. Blood vessels within the <i>Cbx3</i><sup>hypo/hypo</sup> placental labyrinth are narrower than wild-type. Newborn <i>Cbx3</i><sup>hypo/hypo</sup> pups are hypoglycemic, the livers are depleted of glycogen reserves and there is almost complete loss of stored lipid in brown adipose tissue (BAT). There is a 10-fold reduction in expression of the BAT-specific <i>Ucp1</i> gene, whose product is responsible for non-shivering themogenesis. We suggest that it is the small size of the <i>Cbx3</i><sup>hypo/hypo</sup> neonates, a likely consequence of placental growth and transport defects, combined with a possible inability to thermoregulate that causes the severe postnatal mortality.</p>

				<title>Early postnatal exposure to lithium <i>in vitro</i> induces changes in AMPAR mEPSCs and vesicular recycling at hippocampal glutamatergic synapses</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0339-0354</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer but its use is associated with many side effects. Electrophysiological recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) mediated by glutamate receptor AMPA-subtype (AMPARs) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons revealed that CLi (therapeutic concentration of 1 mM lithium, from days <i>in vitro</i> 4–10) decreased the mean amplitude and mean rectification index (RI) of AMPAR mEPSCs. Lowered mean RI indicate that contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs in synaptic events is higher in CLi neurons (supported by experiments sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPAR modulation). Co-inhibiting PKA, GSK-3𝛽 and glutamate reuptake was necessary to bring about changes in AMPAR mEPSCs similar to that seen in CLi neurons. FM1-43 experiments revealed that recycling pool size was affected in CLi cultures. Results from minimum loading, chlorpromazine treatment and hyperosmotic treatment experiments indicate that endocytosis in CLi is affected while not much difference is seen in modes of exocytosis. CLi cultures did not show the high KCl associated presynaptic potentiation observed in control cultures. This study, by calling attention to long-term lithium-exposure-induced synaptic changes, might have implications in understanding the side effects such as CNS complications occurring in perinatally exposed babies and cognitive dulling seen in patients on lithium treatment.</p>

				<title>Functional and structural abnormalities associated with empathy in patients with schizophrenia: An fMRI and VBM study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0355-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Empathy deficit is a core feature of schizophrenia which may lead to social dysfunction. The present study was carried out to investigate functional and structural abnormalities associated with empathy in patients with schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A sample of 14 schizophrenia patients and 14 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and education were examined with structural high-resolution T1-weighted MRI; fMRI images were obtained during empathy task in the same session. The analysis was carried out using SPM8 software. On behavioural assessment, schizophrenic patients (83.00&#177;29.04) showed less scores for sadness compared to healthy controls (128.70&#177;22.26) (𝑝 &#60; 0.001). fMRI results also showed reduced clusters of activation in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, left lingual gyrus, left middle and inferior occipital gyrus in schizophrenic subjects as compared to controls during empathy task. In the same brain areas, VBM results also showed reduced grey and white matter volumes. The present study provides an evidence for an association between structural alterations and disturbed functional brain activation during empathy task in persons affected with schizophrenia. These findings suggest a biological basis for social cognition deficits in schizophrenics.</p>

				<title>Microalgae respond differently to nitrogen availability during culturing</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0365-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variations in the exogenous nitrogen level are known to significantly affect the physiological status and metabolism of microalgae. However, responses of red, green and yellow-green algae to nitrogen (N) availability have not been compared yet. <i>Porphyridium cruentum, Scenedesmus incrassatulus</i> and <i>Trachydiscus minutus</i> were cultured in the absence of N in the medium and subsequent resupply of N to the starved cells. Culture growth and in-gel changes in isoenzyme pattern and activity of glutamate synthase, glutamate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were studied. The results demonstrated that the algae responded to the fully N-depleted and N-replete culture conditions by species-specific metabolic enzyme changes, suggesting differential regulation of both enzyme activity and cellular metabolism. Substantial differences in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes between N-depleted and N-replete cells of each species as well as between the species were also found. In the present work, besides the more general responses, such as adjustment of growth and pigmentation, we report on the involvement of specific metabolic and antioxidant enzymes and their isoforms in the mechanisms operating during N starvation and recovery in <i>P. cruentum, T. minutus</i> and <i>S. incrassatulus</i>.</p>

				<title>Do seed VLCFAs trigger spongy tissue formation in Alphonso mango by inducing germination?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0375-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spongy tissue is a physiological disorder in Alphonso mango caused by the inception of germination-associated events during fruit maturation on the tree, rendering the fruit inedible. Inter-fruit competition during active fruit growth is a major contributing factor for the disorder which leads to reduced fat content in spongy tissue affected fruits. This study was, therefore, carried out to determine the possible association between seed fats and ST formation. The study of the fat content during fruit growth showed that it increased gradually from 40% fruit maturity. At 70% maturity, however, there was a sudden increase of fat content of whole fruit, leading to acute competition and resulting in differential allocation of resources among developing fruits. As a result, the seed in spongy-tissue-affected mature ripe fruit showed a marked drop in the levels of fats and the two very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), tetracosanoic acid and hexacosanoic acid together with an increase of linolenic acid and a fall in oleic acid contents, which are known to be key determinants for the initiation of pre-germination events in seed. Subsequently, a rise in the level of cytokinin and gibberellins in ST seed associated with a fall in abscisic acid level clearly signalled the onset of germination. Concurrently, a significant reduction in the ratio of linolenic acid/linoleic acid in pulp led to the loss of membrane integrity, cell death and the eventual formation of spongy tissue. Based on the above, it is concluded that a significant reduction in the biosynthesis of VLCFAs in seeds during fruit growth might trigger pre-germination events followed by a cascade of biochemical changes in the pulp, leading to lipid peroxidation and membrane injury in pulp culminating in ST development. Thus, this study presents crucial experimental evidence to highlight the critical role played by VLCFAs in inducing ST formation in Alphonso mango during the pre-harvest phase of fruit growth.</p>

				<title>Declines of seagrasses in a tropical harbour, North Queensland, Australia, are not the result of a single event</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0389-0398</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A recent paper inferred that all seagrass in Cairns Harbour, tropical north-eastern Australia, had undergone ‘complete and catastrophic loss’ as a result of tropical cyclone Yasi in 2011. While we agree with the concern expressed, we would like to correct the suggestion that the declines were the result of a single climatic event and that all seagrass in Cairns Harbour were lost. Recent survey data and trend analysis from an on-ground monitoring program show that seagrasses in Cairns Harbour do remain, albeit at low levels, and the decline in seagrasses occurred over several years with cyclone Yasi having little additional impact. We have conducted annual on-ground surveys of seagrass distribution and the above-ground meadow biomass in Cairns Harbour and Trinity Inlet since 2001. This has shown a declining trend in biomass since a peak in 2004 and in area since it peaked in 2007. In 2012, seagrass area and above-ground biomass were significantly below the long-term (12 year) average but seagrass was still present. Declines were associated with regional impacts on coastal seagrasses from multiple years of above-average rainfall and severe storm and cyclone activity, similar to other nearby seagrass areas, and not as a result of a single event.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0399-0406</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Habitat fragmentation is postulated to be a major factor influencing infectious disease dynamics in wildlife populations and may also be responsible, at least in part, for the recent spurt in the emergence, or re-emergence, of infectious diseases in humans. The mechanism behind these relationships are poorly understood due to the lack of insights into the interacting local factors and insufficient baseline data in ecological parasitology of wildlife. Here, we studied the gastrointestinal parasites of nonhuman mammalian hosts living in 10 rainforest patches of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, India. We examined 349 faecal samples of 17 mammalian species and successfully identified 24 gastroin-testinal parasite taxa including 1 protozoan, 2 trematode, 3 cestode and 18 nematode taxa. Twenty of these parasites are known parasites of humans. We also found that as much as 73% of all infected samples were infected by multiple parasites. In addition, the smallest and most fragmented forest patches recorded the highest parasite richness; the pattern across fragments, however, seemed to be less straightforward, suggesting potential interplay of local factors.</p>

				<title>Analysis of humpback whale sounds in shallow waters of the Southeastern Arabian Sea: An indication of breeding habitat</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0407-0417</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The primary objective of this work was to present the acoustical identification of humpback whales, detected by using an autonomous ambient noise measurement system, deployed in the shallow waters of the Southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) during the period January to May 2011. Seven types of sounds were detected. These were characteristically upsweeps and downsweeps along with harmonics. Sounds produced repeatedly in a specific pattern were referred to as phrases (PQRS and ABC). Repeated phrases in a particular pattern were referred to as themes, and from the spectrographic analysis, two themes (I and II) were identified. The variation in the acoustic characteristics such as fundamental frequency, range, duration of the sound unit, and the structure of the phrases and themes are discussed. Sound units were recorded from mid-January to mid-March, with a peak in February, when the mean SST is  ∼ 28&#176;C, and no presence was recorded after mid-March. The temporal and thematic structures strongly determine the functions of the humpback whale song form. Given the use of song in the SEAS, this area is possibly used as an active breeding habitat by humpback whales during the winter season.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Protein oxidation, the process caused especially by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is thought to play a major role in various oxidative processes within cells and is implicated in the development of many human diseases. This review provides a brief overview of the protein oxidation with the emphasis on the types of oxidation (oxidation of protein backbone and amino acid residues side chains, site-specific metal-catalysed protein oxidation), oxidation-dependent generation of protein hydroperoxides, carbonyl derivatives and protein–protein cross-linkages. Non-enzymatic glycoxidation (also known as Maillard reaction) as an important factor of protein damage, consequences of oxidative protein impairment and related diseases as well as means of monitoring and assessment of protein modifications are discussed.</p>

				<title>The substance P/NK-1 receptor system: NK-1 receptor antagonists as anti-cancer drugs</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0441-0463</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The substance P (SP)/neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor system plays an important role in cancer. SP promotes the proliferation of tumour cells, angiogenesis and the migration of tumour cells. We review the involvement of SP, the NK-1 receptor and NK-1 receptor antagonists in cancer. Tumour cells overexpress NK-1 receptors, which are involved in their viability. This overexpression suggests the possibility of specific treatment against tumour cells using NK-1 receptor antagonists, thus promoting a considerable decrease in the side effects of the treatment. This strategy opens up new approaches for cancer treatment, since these antagonists, after binding to their molecular target, induce the death of tumour cells by apoptosis, exert an antiangiogenic action and inhibit the migration of tumour cells. The use of NK-1 receptor antagonists such as aprepitant (used in clinical practice) as antitumour agents could be a promising innovation. The value of aprepitant as an antitumour agent could be determined faster than for less well-known compounds because many studies addressing its safety and characterization have already been completed. The NK-1 receptor may be a promising target in the treatment of cancer; NK-1 receptor antagonists could act as specific drugs against tumour cells; and these antagonists could be new candidate anti-cancer drugs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary infectious agent of PCV-associated disease (PCVAD) in swine. ORF4 protein is a newly identified viral protein of PCV2 and is involved in virus-induced apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of ORF4 protein regulation of apoptosis remain unclear, especially given there is no information regarding any cellular partners of the ORF4 protein. Here, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay and identified four host proteins (FHC, SNRPN, COX8A and Lamin C) interacting with the ORF4 protein. Specially, FHC was chosen for further characterization due to its important role in apoptosis. GST pull-down, subcellular co-location and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that the PCV2 ORF4 protein indeed interacted with the heavy-chain ferritin, which is an interesting clue that will allow us to determine the role of the ORF4 protein in apoptosis.</p>

					<p>The outbreak of an infectious disease in captive-bred Lepidoptera can cause death of all the caterpillars within days. A mixed baculoviral–bacterial infection observed among <i>Actias selene</i> (Hübner 1807), the Indian moon moth (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Saturniidae), larvae was characterized and followed by a photographic documentation of the disease progression. The etiological agents were determined using mass spectrometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It appeared that the disease was caused by a mixed infection of larvae with a baculovirus and <i>Morganella morganii</i>. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of the virus and microbiological description of the pathogenic bacterium are presented.</p>

				<title>Potential gene regulatory role for cyclin D3 in muscle cells</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0497-0512</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cyclin D3 is important for muscle development and regeneration, and is involved in post-mitotic arrest of muscle cells. Cyclin D3 also has cell-cycle-independent functions such as regulation of specific genes in other tissues. Ectopic expression of cyclin D3 in myoblasts, where it is normally undetectable, promotes muscle gene expression and faster differentiation kinetics upon serum depletion. In the present study, we investigated the mechanistic role of cyclin D3 in muscle gene regulation. We initially showed by mutational analysis that a stable and functional cyclin D3 was required for promoting muscle differentiation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that expression of cyclin D3 in undifferentiated myoblasts altered histone epigenetic marks at promoters of muscle-specific genes like MyoD, Pax7, myogenin and muscle creatine kinase but not non-muscle genes. Cyclin D3 expression also reduced the mRNA levels of certain epigenetic modifier genes. Our data suggest that epigenetic modulation of muscle-specific genes in cyclin-D3-expressing myoblasts may be responsible for faster differentiation kinetics upon serum depletion. Our results have implications for a regulatory role for cyclin D3 in muscle-specific gene activation.</p>

				<title>Bifidogenic effect of grain larvae extract on serum lipid, glucose and intestinal microflora in rats</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0513-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main objective of this study was to investigate whether orally administered Korean grain larvae ethanol extract (GLE) had a bifidogenic effect in normal rats. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into a negative control group (CO) and GLE orally administered (5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 mg/100 g body weight) groups. Thymus and spleen weights dosedependently increased by 128.58% and 128.58%, respectively, but abdominal fat decreased by 19.18% after GLE administration compared with that in the CO group (𝑝&#60;0.05). Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose decreased by 30.26%, 7.33%, 27.20%, and 6.96%, respectively, whereas highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 129.93% in the GLE groups compared with those in the CO group (𝑝&#60;0.05). IgG, IgM, IgA in the GLE groups increased 203.68%, 181.41%, and 238.25%, respectively, compared to that in the CO group (𝑝&#60;0.05). <i>Bifidobacteria</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> increased by 115.74% and 144.28%, whereas <i>Bacteroides, Clostridium, Escherichia</i>, and <i>Streptococcus</i> decreased by 17.37%, 17.46%, 21.25%, and 19.16%, respectively, in the GLE groups compared with those in the CO group (𝑝&#60;0.05). Total organic acids, acetic acid, and propionic acid increased by 151.40%, 188.09%, and 150.17%, whereas butyric acid and valeric acid decreased by 40.65% and 49.24%, respectively, in the GLE groups as compared with those in the CO group (𝑝&#60;0.05). These results suggest that Korean GLE improves the bifidogenic effect by increasing cecal organic acids and modulating gut microflora via a selective increase in <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in normal rats.</p>

				<title>Role of leptin G-2548A polymorphism in age- and gender-specific development of obesity</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0521-0530</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Leptin is involved in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure, and therefore, is central to adipositysensing pathway. We examined the relationship of the leptin G-2548A polymorphism with obesity and obesityrelated anthropometric and metabolic parameters in a total of 394 (239 obese and 155 non-obese) subjects between 5 and 45 years of age. Body weight, height, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and blood pressure (BP) were measured. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, leptin and leptin receptor were determined, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Genotyping was carried out by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The <i>LEP</i> G-2548A polymorphism showed association with obesity in children and adolescents (&#8804;18 years of age) but not in adults. However, analysis by gender stratification revealed association with obesity in girls only. In addition, G-2548A polymorphism showed association with BMI, WC, HC, fasting blood glucose and serum leptin levels. This suggests that G-2548A polymorphism may influence the susceptibility to metabolic disturbances and obesity at an early life. Further investigation with a larger sample size is required to validate the effect of <i>LEP</i> G-2548A polymorphism in obese Pakistani girls.</p>

				<title>The potential role of myostatin and neurotransmission genes in elite sport performances</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0531-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Elite athletes are those who represent their sport at such major competition as the Olympic Games or World contests. The most outstanding athletes appear to emerge as a result of endogenous biologic characteristics interacting with exogenous influences of the environment, often described as a `Nature and Nurture’ struggle. In this work, we assessed the contribution given by 4 genes involved in muscles development (<i>MSTN</i>) and behavioural insights (<i>5HTT, DAT</i> and <i>MAOA</i>) to athletic performances. As for neurotransmission, <i>5HTT, DAT</i> and <i>MAOA</i> genes have been considered as directly involved in the management of aggressiveness and anxiety.</p>
					<p>Genotypes and allelic frequencies of <i>5HTTLPR, MAOA</i>-u VNTR, <i>DAT</i> VNTR and <i>MSTN</i> K153R were determined in 50 elite athletes and compared with 100 control athletes.</p>
					<p>In this work we found a significant correlation between the dopamine transporter genotype 9/9 and allele 9 and elite sport performances. On the contrary, no association was found between muscle development regulation or serotonin pathway and elite performances. Our data, for the first time, suggest a strong role of dopamine neurotransmitter in determining sport success, highlighting the role of emotional control and psycological management to reach high-level performances.</p>

				<title>Diversity of sickle cell trait in Jharkhand state in India: Is it the zone of contact between two geographically and ethnically distinct populations in India?</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0539-0547</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Incidence of sickle cell trait in India is high in peninsular south, south-eastern, central and south-western India, while in north and north-eastern India, it is absent. Unicentric origin of SCD in the tribals of nilgiri hills in southern India has been proposed. The present study on the frequency of HbS trait and 𝛽-globin gene haplotypes was conducted in the tribal-rich states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand to get an insight into the uneven distribution of HbS in India. Jharkhand borders with the HbS-high Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and HbS-low UP, Bihar and Bengal. Cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis was performed on the collected blood samples, to detect sickle haemoglobin (HbS) followed by DNA analysis. HbS associated 𝛽-gene haplotype was constructed for the samples positive for HbS and all the tribals by PCR-RFLP. Out of 805 (Chhattisgarh – 261, Jharkhand – 544; &#62;36% tribals) samples analysed HbS frequency was 13% in Chhattisgarh and 3.3% in Jharkhand. Within Jharkhand, frequencies varied considerably from 10% in Tatanagar to nil in Sahibganj. The Arab-India (AI) haplotype of 𝛽-globin cluster occurred in low frequency, confined mainly to Chhattisgarh. The most abundant haplotype in all the populations was the East Asian, + − − − − − +, rare in HbS, mainly in Sahibganj in east Jharkhand, which lacked AI. Our results indicate that besides the heterozygote advantage againstmalaria, the uneven regional distribution of HbS trait is because of restricted movement of two different populations, Dravidian from the south and Tibeto-Burman from the east into the Indianmainland which failed tomeet, we conjecture, due to severe climatic conditions (deserts and heat) prevailing through parts of central India. Apparently, Jharkhand became a zone of contact between them in recent times.</p>

				<title>Actin filaments as the fast pathways for calcium ions involved in auditory processes</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0549-0559</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated the polyelectrolyte properties of actin filaments which are in interaction with myosin motors, basic participants in mechano-electrical transduction in the stereocilia of the inner ear. Here, we elaborated a model in which actin filaments play the role of guides or pathways for localized flow of calcium ions. It is well recognized that calcium ions are implicated in tuning of actin-myosin cross-bridge interaction, which controls the mechanical property of hair bundle. Actin filaments enable much more efficient delivery of calcium ions and faster mechanism for their distribution within the stereocilia. With this model we were able to semiquantitatively explain experimental evidences regarding the way of how calcium ions tune the mechanosensitivity of hair cells.</p>

				<title>Strain- and context-based 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations and anxiety behaviour in the Wistar-Kyoto rat</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0561-0570</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rodent ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are influenced by immediate, prior contexts and have emerged as important indicators that monitor an individual’s ‘state’. They also index direct reflections of inherent ‘trait’ and are suggested to constitute non-invasive read-outs of pathological conditions. Analysis of USVs emitted under particular contexts could help discern strain-specific differences and existence of individual USV profiles. USVs of the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) strain, a putative model of depression, could indicate social communication deficits. In the cage, USV emission was significantly reduced in WKYs. An elevated plus maze exposure led to no change in USV emission in WKYs, while it significantly reduced USVs in Wistars. Re-exposure induced strain-specific differences in behaviour and total calling time. Sonographic patterns indicated that the predominant USV subtype were flat 50 kHz USVs. EPMexposure induced a reduction in peak amplitude in WKY USVs and in USV length in both strains. USV peak frequency and amplitude, genetically determined spectral features, were strain-specific, while bandwidth and temporal features such as total calling time and USV duration were context-dependent. WKY USVs demonstrated characteristic spectral structures such as increased call length and reduced peak frequency while other parameters were not quantitatively different, reflecting the shared phylogeny between Wistars and WKYs.</p>

				<title>FASTR: A novel data format for concomitant representation of RNA sequence and secondary structure information</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0571-0577</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Given the importance of RNA secondary structures in defining their biological role, it would be convenient for researchers seeking RNA data if both sequence and structural information pertaining to RNA molecules are made available together. Current nucleotide data repositories archive only RNA sequence data. Furthermore, storage formats which can frugally represent RNA sequence as well as structure data in a single file, are currently unavailable. This article proposes a novel storage format, `FASTR’, for concomitant representation of RNA sequence and structure. The storage efficiency of the proposed FASTR format has been evaluated using RNA data from various microorganisms. Results indicate that the size of FASTR formatted files (containing both RNA sequence as well as structure information) are equivalent to that of FASTA-format files, which contain only RNA sequence information. RNA secondary structure is typically represented using a combination of a string of nucleotide characters along with the corresponding dot-bracket notation indicating structural attributes. `FASTR’ – the novel storage format proposed in the present study enables a frugal representation of both RNA sequence and structural information in the form of a single string. In spite of having a relatively smaller storage footprint, the resultant `fastr’ string(s) retain all sequence as well as secondary structural information that could be stored using a dot-bracket notation. An implementation of the `FASTR’ methodology is available for download at <i>http://metagenomics.atc.tcs.com/compression/fastr</i>.</p>

				<title>The emerging roles of inositol pyrophosphates in eukaryotic cell physiology</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0593-0605</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inositol pyrophosphates are water soluble derivatives of inositol that contain pyrophosphate or diphosphate moieties in addition to monophosphates. The best characterised inositol pyrophosphates, are IP<sub>7</sub> (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate or PP-IP<sub>5</sub>), and IP<sub>8</sub> (bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate or (PP)<sub>2</sub>-IP<sub>4</sub>). These energy-rich small molecules are present in all eukaryotic cells, from yeast to mammals, and are involved in a wide range of cellular functions including apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, DNA repair, osmoregulation, phosphate homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, immune signalling, cell cycle regulation, and ribosome synthesis. Identified more than 20 years ago, there is still only a rudimentary understanding of the mechanisms by which inositol pyrophosphates participate in these myriad pathways governing cell physiology and homeostasis. The unique stereochemical and bioenergetic properties these molecules possess as a consequence of the presence of one or two pyrophosphate moieties in the vicinity of densely packed monophosphates are likely to form the molecular basis for their participation in multiple signalling and metabolic pathways. The aim of this review is to provide first time researchers in this area with an introduction to inositol pyrophosphates and a comprehensive overview on their cellular functions.</p>

				<title>Approaches for targeted proteomics and its potential applications in neuroscience</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0607-0627</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An extensive guide on practicable and significant quantitative proteomic approaches in neuroscience research is important not only because of the existing overwhelming limitations but also for gaining valuable understanding into brain function and deciphering proteomics from the workbench to the bedside. Early methodologies to understand the functioning of biological systems are now improving with high-throughput technologies, which allow analysis of various samples concurrently, or of thousand of analytes in a particular sample. Quantitative proteomic approaches include both gel-based and non-gel-based methods that can be further divided into different labelling approaches. This review will emphasize the role of existing technologies, their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their applications in neuroscience. This review will also discuss advanced approaches for targeted proteomics using isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) coupled with laser capture microdissection (LCM) followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. This technology can further be extended to single cell proteomics in other areas of biological sciences and can be combined with other ‘omics’ approaches to reveal the mechanism of a cellular alterations. This approach may lead to further investigation in basic biology, disease analysis and surveillance, as well as drug discovery. Although numerous challenges still exist, we are confident that this approach will increase the understanding of pathological mechanisms involved in neuroendocrinology, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders by delivering protein biomarker signatures for brain dysfunction.</p>

				<title>Microirradiation techniques in radiobiological research</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0629-0643</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this work is to review the uses of laser microirradiation and ion microbeam techniques within the scope of radiobiological research. Laser microirradiation techniques can be used for many different purposes. In a specific condition, through the use of pulsed lasers, cell lysis can be produced for subsequent separation of different analytes. Microsurgery allows for the identification and isolation of tissue sections, single cells and subcellular components, using different types of lasers. The generation of different types of DNA damage, via this type of microirradiation, allows for the investigation of DNA dynamics. Ion microbeams are important tools in radiobiological research. There are only a limited number of facilities worldwide where radiobiological experiments can be performed. In the beginning, research was mostly focused on the bystander effect. Nowadays, with more sophisticated molecular and cellular biological techniques, ion microirradiation is used to unravel molecular processes in the field of radiobiology. These include DNA repair protein kinetics or chromatin modifications at the site of DNA damage. With the increasing relevance of charged particles in tumour therapy and new concepts on how to generate them, ion microbeam facilities are able to address unresolved questions concerning particle tumour therapy.</p>

				<title>Genome engineering and parthenocloning in the silkworm, Bombyx mori</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0645-0655</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic engineering of the silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, opens door to the production of new kinds of silk and to the use of silkworms as proteosynthetic bioreactors. The insertion of foreign genes into silkworm genome and the control of their expression by diverse promoters have become possible but are not yet efficient enough for commercial use. Several methods of gene targeting are being developed to minimize position effect on transgene expression and facilitate cloning. Parthenocloning can be exploited to conserve genetic traits and improve selection and amplification of clones containing genes of interest. Some silkworm clones have been bred for decades as genetically stable female stocks whose unfertilized eggs are induced to develop by heat-shock treatment. Any exclusively female generation contains exact copies of the maternal clone-founder genome. Ovaries transplanted in either direction between the standard and the parthenogenetic genotypes yield eggs capable of parthenocloning. In addition, use ofmale larvae as ovary recipients eliminates diapause in eggs produced in the implants. Unfertilized eggs of some silkworm clones respond also to the cold-shock treatment by producing homozygous fertile sons; cloned females can be crossed with their parthenogenetic sons to obtain progeny homozygous for the transgene in both sexes. Rational exploitation of available parthenozygous pools and the use of parthenocloning methods enable rapid fixation and maintenance of the desired genotypes.</p>

				<title>Cancer research in need of a scientific revolution: Using `paradigm shift’ as a method of investigation</title>
				<feature>Reviews</feature>
				<page>0657-0666</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Despite important human and financial resources and considerable accumulation of scientific publications, patents, and clinical trials, cancer research has been slow in achieving a therapeutic revolution similar to the one that occurred in the last century for infectious diseases. It has been proposed that science proceeds not only by accumulating data but also through paradigm shifts. Here, we propose to use the concept of `paradigm shift’ as a method of investigation when dominant paradigms fail to achieve their promises. The first step in using the `paradigm shift’ method in cancer research requires identifying its founding paradigms. In this review, two of these founding paradigms will be discussed:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the reification of cancer as a tumour mass and</li>
						<li>the translation of the concepts issued from infectious disease in cancer research.</li>
					</ol> 
					<p>We show how these founding paradigms can generate biases that lead to over-diagnosis and over-treatment and also hamper the development of curative cancer therapies. We apply the `paradigm shift’ method to produce perspective reversals consistent with current experimental evidence. The `paradigm shift’ method enlightens the existence of a tumour physiologic–prophylactic–pathologic continuum. It integrates the target/antitarget concept and that cancer is also an extracellular disease. The `paradigm shift’ method has immediate implications for cancer prevention and therapy. It could be a general method of investigation for other diseases awaiting therapy.</p>

				<title>pubmed.mineR: An R package with text-mining algorithms to analyse PubMed abstracts</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0671-0682</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The PubMed literature database is a valuable source of information for scientific research. It is rich in biomedical literature with more than 24 million citations. Data-mining of voluminous literature is a challenging task. Although several text-mining algorithms have been developed in recent years with focus on data visualization, they have limitations such as speed, are rigid and are not available in the open source. We have developed an R package, pubmed.mineR, wherein we have combined the advantages of existing algorithms, overcome their limitations, and offer user flexibility and link with other packages in Bioconductor and the Comprehensive R Network (CRAN) in order to expand the user capabilities for executing multifaceted approaches. Three case studies are presented, namely, `Evolving role of diabetes educators', `Cancer risk assessment' and `Dynamic concepts on disease and comorbidity' to illustrate the use of pubmed.mineR. The package generally runs fast with small elapsed times in regular workstations even on large corpus sizes and with compute intensive functions. The pubmed.mineR is available at <i>http://cran.r- project.org/web/packages/pubmed.mineR</i>.</p>

				<title>Analysis of core–periphery organization in protein contact networks reveals groups of structurally and functionally critical residues</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0683-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The representation of proteins as networks of interacting amino acids, referred to as protein contact networks (PCN), and their subsequent analyses using graph theoretic tools, can provide novel insights into the key functional roles of specific groups of residues. We have characterized the networks corresponding to the native states of 66 proteins (belonging to different families) in terms of their core–periphery organization. The resulting hierarchical classification of the amino acid constituents of a protein arranges the residues into successive layers – having higher <i>core order</i>– with increasing connection density, ranging from a sparsely linked <i>periphery</i> to a densely intra-connected <i>core</i> (distinct from the earlier concept of protein core defined in terms of the three-dimensional geometry of the native state, which has least solvent accessibility). Our results show that residues in the inner cores are more conserved than those at the periphery. Underlining the functional importance of the network core, we see that the receptor sites for known ligand molecules of most proteins occur in the innermost core. Furthermore, the association of residues with structural pockets and cavities in binding or active sites increases with the core order. From mutation sensitivity analysis, we show that the probability of deleterious or intolerant mutations also increases with the core order. We also show that stabilization centre residues are in the innermost cores, suggesting that the network core is critically important in maintaining the structural stability of the protein. A publicly available Web resource for performing core–periphery analysis of any protein whose native state is known has been made available by us at <i>http://www.imsc.res.in/ ~ sitabhra/proteinKcore/index.html</i>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks are believed to be important sources of information related to biological processes and complex metabolic functions of the cell. Identifying protein complexes is of great importance for understanding cellular organization and functions of organisms. In this work, a method is proposed, referred to as MIPCE, to find protein complexes in a PPI network based on mutual information. MIPCE has been biologically validated by GO-based score and satisfactory results have been obtained. We have also compared our method with some well-known methods and obtained better results in terms of various parameters such as precession, recall and F-measure.</p>

				<title>DNA pattern recognition using canonical correlation algorithm</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0709-0719</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We performed canonical correlation analysis as an unsupervised statistical tool to describe related views of the same semantic object for identifying patterns. A pattern recognition technique based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was proposed for finding required genetic code in the DNA sequence. Two related but different objects were considered: one was a particular pattern, and other was test DNA sequence. CCA found correlations between two observations of the same semantic pattern and test sequence. It is concluded that the relationship possesses maximum value in the position where the pattern exists. As a case study, the potential of CCA was demonstrated on the sequence found from HIV-1 preferred integration sites. The subsequences on the left and right flanking from the integration site were considered as the two views, and statistically significant relationships were established between these two views to elucidate the viral preference as an important factor for the correlation.</p>

				<title>Feature selection using feature dissimilarity measure and density-based clustering: Application to biological data</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reduction of dimensionality has emerged as a routine process in modelling complex biological systems. A large number of feature selection techniques have been reported in the literature to improve model performance in terms of accuracy and speed. In the present article an unsupervised feature selection technique is proposed, using maximum information compression index as the dissimilarity measure and the well-known density-based cluster identification technique DBSCAN for identifying the largest natural group of dissimilar features. The algorithm is fast and less sensitive to the user-supplied parameters. Moreover, the method automatically determines the required number of features and identifies them. We used the proposed method for reducing dimensionality of a number of benchmark data sets of varying sizes. Its performance was also extensively compared with some other well-known feature selection methods.</p>

				<title>Semi-supervised prediction of gene regulatory networks using machine learning algorithms</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0731-0740</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Use of computational methods to predict gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is a challenging task. Many studies have been conducted using unsupervised methods to fulfill the task; however, such methods usually yield low prediction accuracies due to the lack of training data. In this article, we propose semi-supervised methods for GRN prediction by utilizing two machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF). The semi-supervised methods make use of unlabelled data for training. We investigated inductive and transductive learning approaches, both of which adopt an iterative procedure to obtain reliable negative training data from the unlabelled data. We then applied our semi-supervised methods to gene expression data of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, and evaluated the performance of our methods using the expression data. Our analysis indicated that the transductive learning approach outperformed the inductive learning approach for both organisms. However, there was no conclusive difference identified in the performance of SVM and RF. Experimental results also showed that the proposed semi-supervised methods performed better than existing supervised methods for both organisms.</p>

				<page>0741-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, we have used an index, called Gaussian fuzzy index (GFI), recently developed by the authors, based on the notion of fuzzy set theory, for validating the clusters obtained by a clustering algorithm applied on cancer gene expression data. GFI is then used for the identification of genes that have altered quite significantly from normal state to carcinogenic state with respect to their mRNA expression patterns. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated on three gene expression cancer datasets dealing with human lung, colon and leukemia. The performance of GFI is compared with 19 exiting cluster validity indices. The results are appropriately validated biologically and statistically. In this context, we have used biochemical pathways, 𝑝-value statistics of GO attributes, 𝑡-test and 𝑧-score for the validation of the results. It has been reported that GFI is capable of identifying high-quality enriched clusters of genes, and thereby is able to select more cancer-mediating genes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A challenge in bioinformatics is to analyse volumes of gene expression data generated through microarray experiments and obtain useful information. Consequently, most microarray studies demand complex data analysis to infer biologically meaningful information from such high-throughput data. Selection of informative genes is an important data analysis step to identify a set of genes which can further help in finding the biological information embedded in microarray data, and thus assists in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the disease. In this article we present an unsupervised feature selection technique which attempts to address the goal of explorative data analysis, unfolding the multi-faceted nature of data. It focuses on extracting multiple clustering views considering the diversity of each view from high-dimensional data. We evaluated our technique on benchmark data sets and the experimental results indicates the potential and effectiveness of the proposed model in comparison to the traditional single view clustering models, as well as other existing methods used in the literature for the studied datasets.</p>

				<title>Temporal protein expression pattern in intracellular signalling cascade during T-cell activation: A computational study</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0769-0789</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Various T-cell co-receptor molecules and calcium channel CRAC play a pivotal role in the maintenance of cell’s functional responses by regulating the production of effector molecules (mostly cytokines) that aids in immune clearance and also maintaining the cell in a functionally active state. Any defect in these co-receptor signalling pathways may lead to an altered expression pattern of the effector molecules. To study the propagation of such defects with time and their effect on the intracellular protein expression patterns, a comprehensive and largest pathway map of T-cell activation network is reconstructed manually. The entire pathway reactions are then translated using logical equations and simulated using the published time series microarray expression data as inputs. After validating the model, the effect of <i>in silico</i> knock down of co-receptor molecules on the expression patterns of their downstream proteins is studied and simultaneously the changes in the phenotypic behaviours of the T-cell population are predicted, which shows significant variations among the proteins expression and the signalling routes through which the response is propagated in the cytoplasm. This integrative computational approach serves as a valuable technique to study the changes in protein expression patterns and helps to predict variations in the cellular behaviour.</p>

				<title>Knowledge-based analysis of functional impacts of mutations in microRNA seed regions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0791-0798</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MicroRNAs are a class of important post-transcriptional regulators. Genetic and somatic mutations in miRNAs, especially those in the seed regions, have profound and broad impacts on gene expression and physiological and pathological processes. Over 500 SNPs were mapped to the miRNA seeds, which are located at position 2–8 of the mature miRNA sequences. We found that the central positions of the miRNA seeds contain fewer genetic variants and therefore are more evolutionary conserved than the peripheral positions in the seeds. We developed a knowledge-based method to analyse the functional impacts of mutations in miRNA seed regions. We computed the gene ontology-based similarity score GOSS and the GOSS percentile score for all 517 SNPs in miRNA seeds. In addition to the annotation of SNPs for their functional effects, in the present article we also present a detailed analysis pipeline for finding the key functional changes for seed SNPs. We performed a detailed gene ontology graph-based analysis of enriched functional categories for miRNA target gene sets. In the analysis of a SNP in the seed region of hsa-miR-96 we found that two key biological processes for progressive hearing loss `Neurotrophin TRK receptor signaling pathway' and `Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway' were significantly and differentially enriched by the two sets of allele-specific target genes of miRNA hsa-miR-96.</p>

The structure of metabolic networks also reveals valuable insights into metabolic capacity of species as well as into the habitats where they have evolved. We constructed metabolic networks of 79 fully sequenced organisms and compared their architectures. We used spectral density of normalized Laplacian matrix for comparing the structure of networks. The eigenvalues of this matrix reflect not only the global architecture of a network but also the local topologies that are produced by different graph evolutionary processes like motif duplication or joining. A divergence measure on spectral densities is used to quantify the distances between various metabolic networks, and a split network is constructed to analyse the phylogeny from these distances. In our analysis, we focused on the species that belong to different classes, but appear more related to each other in the phylogeny. We tried to explore whether they have evolved under similar environmental conditions or have similar life histories. With this focus, we have obtained interesting insights into the phylogenetic commonality between different organisms.</p>

				<title>Protein–Protein interaction site prediction in <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>E. coli</i> using an interaction-affinity based membership function in fuzzy SVM</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0809-0818</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein–protein interaction (PPI) site prediction aids to ascertain the interface residues that participate in interaction processes. Fuzzy support vector machine (F-SVM) is proposed as an effective method to solve this problem, and we have shown that the performance of the classical SVM can be enhanced with the help of an interaction-affinity based fuzzy membership function. The performances of both SVM and F-SVM on the PPI databases of the <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>E. coli</i> organisms are evaluated and estimated the statistical significance of the developed method over classical SVM and other fuzzy membership-based SVM methods available in the literature. Our membership function uses the residue-level interaction affinity scores for each pair of positive and negative sequence fragments. The average AUC scores in the 10-fold cross-validation experiments are measured as 79.94% and 80.48% for the <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>E. coli</i> organisms respectively. On the independent test datasets, AUC scores are obtained as 76.59% and 80.17% respectively for the two organisms. In almost all cases, the developed F-SVM method improves the performances obtained by the corresponding classical SVM and the other classifiers, available in the literature.</p>

				<title>Flux balance analysis of genome-scale metabolic model of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>): Aiming to increase biomass</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0819-0828</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Due to socio-economic reasons, it is essential to design efficient stress-tolerant, more nutritious, high yielding rice varieties. A systematic understanding of the rice cellular metabolism is essential for this purpose. Here, we analyse a genome-scale metabolic model of rice leaf using Flux Balance Analysis to investigate whether it has potential metabolic flexibility to increase the biosynthesis of any of the biomass components. We initially simulate the metabolic responses under an objective to maximize the biomass components. Using the estimated maximum value of biomass synthesis as a constraint, we further simulate the metabolic responses optimizing the cellular economy. Depending on the physiological conditions of a cell, the transport capacities of intracellular transporters (ICTs) can vary. To mimic this physiological state, we randomly vary the ICTs’ transport capacities and investigate their effects. The results show that the rice leaf has the potential to increase glycine and starch in a wide range depending on the ICTs’ transport capacities. The predicted biosynthesis pathways vary slightly at the two different optimization conditions. With the constraint of biomass composition, the cell also has the metabolic plasticity to fix a wide range of carbon-nitrogen ratio.</p>

				<title>Topoisomerase IB of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> resolves guanine quadruplex DNA structures <i>in vitro</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0833-0843</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deinococcus radiodurans genome contains a large number of guanine repeats interrupted by a few non-guanine bases, termed G motifs. Some of these G motifs were shown forming guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structure <i>in vitro</i>. How is the formation and relaxation of G4 DNA regulated in the genome of <i>D. radiodurans</i> is not known and is worth investigating. Here, we showed that the topoisomerase lb of D. radiodurans (DraTopolB) could change the electrophoretic mobility of fast migrating intramolecular <i>rec</i>𝐹-G4 DNA into the slow migrating species. DraTopolB also reduced the positive ellipticity in circular diachroism (CD) spectra of intramolecular <i>rec</i>𝐹-G4 DNA structures stabilized by K<sup>+</sup>. On the contrary, when DraTopolB is incubated with G-motifs annealed without K<sup>+</sup>, it showed neither any change in electrophoretic mobility nor was ellipticity of the CD spectra affected. DNA synthesis by Taq DNA polymerase through G4 DNA structure was attenuated in the presence of G4 DNA binding drugs, which was abrogated by DraTopolB. This implies that DraTopolB could destabilize the G4 DNA structure, which is required for G4 drugs binding and stabilization. Camptothecin treatment inhibited DraTopolB activity on intramolecular G4 DNA structures. These results suggested that DraTopolB can relax intramolecular G4 DNA structure <i>in vitro</i> and it may be one such protein that could resolve G4 DNA under normal growth conditions in <i>D. radiodurans.</i></p>

				<title>Chromosomal context and replication properties of ARS plasmids in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0845-0853</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Short, specific DNA sequences called as Autonomously Replicating Sequence (ARS) elements function as plasmid as well as chromosomal replication origins in yeasts. As compared to ARSs, different chromosomal origins vary greatly in their efficiency and timing of replication probably due to their wider chromosomal context. The two <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> ARS elements, ars727 and ars2OO4, represent two extremities in their chromosomal origin activity - ars727 is inactive and late replicating, while ars2OO4 is a highly active, early-firing origin. To determine the effect of chromosomal context on the activity of these ARS elements, we have cloned them with their extended chromosomal context as well as in the context of each other in both orientations and analysed their replication efficiency by ARS and plasmid stability assays. We found that these ARS elements retain their origin activity in their extended/altered context. However, deletion of a 133-bp region of the previously reported ars727-associated late replication enforcing element (LRE) caused advancement in replication timing of the resulting plasmid. These results confirm the role of LRE in directing plasmid replication timing and suggest that the plasmid origin efficiency of ars2OO4 or ars727 remains unaltered by the extended chromosomal context.</p>

				<title>Semaphorin 4A enhances lung fibrosis through activation of Akt via PlexinD1 receptor</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0855-0862</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Semaphorin 4A plays a regulatory role in immune function and angiogenesis. However, its specific involvement in controlling lung fibrosis, a process that is closely related to angiogenesis and inflammation is still poorly understood. In the present study, we show that treatment of Sema4A on normal lung fibroblasts induces expression of proteins that contribute to a contractile phenotype, including a-smooth muscle actin (𝛼-SMA), ezrin, moesin, and paxillin. We confirm that Sema4A enhances the ability of lung fibroblasts to contract collagen gel. Sema4A treatment led to resistance to apoptosis in normal lung fibroblasts. Relative to normal lung fibroblasts, fibroblasts cultured from scars of patients with the flbrotic disease Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) showed elevated Sema4A secretion, enhanced 𝛼-SMA, ezrin, moesin, and paxillin expression, and high ability to induce collagen gel contraction. Using neutralizing antibody against Sema4A receptor, PlexinD1, we found that endogenous Sema4A signalling in SSc fibroblast was through PlexinD1 receptor. We then identified the signalling mechanism through which Sema4A-PlexinD1 promotes the ability of normal fibroblasts to contract a collagen gel matrix. Western blot analysis showed that Sema4A activated the Akt pathway in lung fibroblasts, and the specific inhibitor of Akt pathway, Akt inhibitor III, blocked the ability of Sema4A to promote the ability of lung fibroblasts to contract a collagen gel matrix. Thus, blocking Sema4A-PlexinD1-Akt cascades might be beneficial in reducing pulmonary fibrosis.</p>

				<title>Interdependence of laforin and malin proteins for their stability and functions could underlie the molecular basis of locus heterogeneity in Lafora disease</title>

				<page>0863-0871</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lafora disease (LD), an autosomal recessive and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the presence of polyglucosan inclusions in the affected tissues including the brain. LD can be caused by defects either in the 𝐸𝑃𝑀2𝐴 gene coding for the laforin protein phosphatase or the 𝑁𝐻𝐿𝑅𝐶𝐼 gene coding for the malin ubiquitin ligase. Since the clinical symptoms of LD patients representing the two genetic groups are very similar and since malin is known to interact with laforin, we were curious to examine the possibility that the two proteins regulate each others function. Using cell biological assays we demonstrate here that</p>
					<ol>
						<li>malin promotes its own degradation via auto-ubiquitination,</li>
						<li>laforin prevents the auto-degradation of malin by presenting itself as a substrate and</li>
						<li>malin preferentially degrades the phosphatase-inactive laforin monomer. Our results that laforin and malin regulate each others stability and activity offers a novel and attractive model to explain the molecular basis of locus heterogeneityobserved in LD.</li>

				<title>Regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms at the beginning of intron 2 of the human 𝐾𝑅𝐴𝑆 gene</title>

				<page>0873-0883</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are two regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) at the beginning of the second intron of the mouse 𝐾-𝑟𝑎𝑠 gene that are strongly associated with lung cancer susceptibility. We performed functional analysis of three SNPs (rs12228277: T&#62;A, rs12226937: G&#62;A, and rs61761074: T&#62;G) located in the same region of human 𝐾𝑅𝐴𝑆. We found that rs12228277 and rs61761074 result in differential binding patterns of lung nuclear proteins to oligonucleotide probes corresponding two alternative alleles; in both cases, the transcription factor NF-Y is involved. G&#62;A substitution (rs12226937) had no effect on the binding of lung nuclear proteins. However, all the nucleotide substitutions under study showed functional effects in a luciferase reporter assay. Among them, rs61761074 demonstrated a significant correlation with allele frequency in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Taken together, the results of our study suggest that a T&#62;G substitution at nucleotide position 615 in the second intron of the KRAS gene (rs61761074) may represent a promising genetic marker of NSCLC.</p>

				<title>Signatures of positive selection at hemopexin (PEX) domain of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0885-0890</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) is an important cancer-associated, zinc-dependent endopeptidase. To investigate the natural selection hypothesis of MMP-9, the orthologous sequences from 12 vertebrates were compared and a molecular evolution analysis was performed. Results suggest that amino acid residues present in the middle region of the protein are more selectively constrained, whereas amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the MM~P-9 protein including exon 13 showed lowest conservation level in non-primate species, suggesting that it is an exon with fast evolving rate compared to the others analyzed. InterProScan analysis shows that exon 13 was located in hemopexin (PEX) domain of MM~P-9. Positive selection was detected in PEX domain of MMP-9 protein between human and other species, which indicates that selective pressure may play a role in shaping the function of MM~P-9 in the course of evolution.</p>

				<title>Comparative sequence analyses of genome and transcriptome reveal novel transcripts and variants in the Asian elephant <i>Elephas maximus</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0891-0907</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Asian elephant <i>Elephas maximus</i> and the African elephant <i>Loxodonta africana</i> that diverged 5-7 million years ago exhibit differences in their physiology, behaviour and morphology. A comparative genomics approach would be useful and necessary for evolutionary and functional genetic studies of elephants. We performed sequencing of <i>E. maximus</i> and map to <i>L. africana</i> at ∼ 15X coverage. Through comparative sequence analyses, we have identified Asian elephant specific homozygous, non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that map to 1514 protein coding genes, many of which are involved in olfaction. We also present the first report of a high-coverage transcriptome sequence in <i>E. maximus</i> from peripheral blood lymphocytes. We have identified 103 novel protein coding transcripts and 66-long non-coding (Inc)RNAs. We also report the presence of 181 protein domains unique to elephants when compared to other Afrotheria species. Each of these findings can be further investigated to gain a better understanding of functional differences unique to elephant species, as well as those unique to elephantids in comparison with other mammals. This work therefore provides a valuable resource to explore the immense research potential of comparative analyses of transcriptome and genome sequences in the Asian elephant.</p>

				<title>Differential neural activation for camouflage detection task in Field-independent and Field-Dependent individuals: Evidence from fMRI</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0909-0919</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is not clearly known as to why some people identify camouflaged objects with ease compared with others. The literature suggests that Field-Independent individuals detect camouflaged object better than their Field-Dependent counterparts, without having evidence at the neural activation level. A paradigm was designed to obtain neural correlates of camouflage detection, with real-life photographs, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-three healthy human subjects were stratified as Field-Independent (Fl) and Field-Dependent (FD), with Witkins Embedded Figure Test. FIs performed better than FDs (marginal significance; 𝑝=0.054) during camouflage detection task. fMRI revealed differential activation pattern between Fl and FD subjects for this task. One sample T-test showed greater activation in terms of cluster size in FDs, whereas FIs showed additional areas for the same task. On direct comparison of the two groups, Fl subjects showed additional activation in parts of primary visual cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, inferior and middle frontal gyrus. Conversely, FDs showed greater activation in inferior frontal gyms, precentral gyms, putamen, caudate nucleus and superior parietal lobule as compared to FIs. The results give preliminary evidence to the differential neural activation underlying the variances in cognitive styles of the two groups.</p>

				<title>Asymmetric cell division and its role in cell fate determination in the green alga <i>Tetraselmis indica</i></title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0921-0927</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The prasinophytes (early diverging Chlorophyta), consisting of simple unicellular green algae, occupy a critical position at the base of the green algal tree of life, with some of its representatives viewed as the cell form most similar to the first green alga, the `ancestral green flagellate'. Relatively large-celled unicellular eukaryotic phytoflagellates (such as <i>Tetraselmis and Scherffelia</i>), traditionally placed in Prasinophyceae but now considered as members of Chlorodendrophyceae (core Chlorophyta), have retained some primitive characteristics of prasinophytes. These organisms share several ultrastructural features with the other core chlorophytes (Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae). However, the role of Chlorodendrophycean algae as the evolutionary link between cellular individuality and cellular cooperation has been largely unstudied. Here, we show that clonal populations of a unicellular chlorophyte, <i>Tetraselmis indica</i>, consist of morphologically and ultrastructurally variant cells which arise through asymmetric cell division. These cells also differ in their physiological properties. The structural and physiological differences in the clonal cell population correlate to a certain extent with the longevity and function of cells.</p>

				<title>Structural studies on a non toxic homologue of type II RIPs from bitter gourd: Molecular basis of non toxicity, conformational selection and glycan structure</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0929-0941</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The structures of nine independent crystals of bitter gourd seed lectin (BGSL), a non-toxic homologue of type II RIPS, and its sugar complexes have been determined. The four-chain, two-fold symmetric, protein is made up of two identical two-chain modules, each consisting of a catalytic chain and a lectin chain, connected by a disulphide bridge. The lectin chain is made up of two domains. Each domain carries a carbohydrate binding site in type II RIPS of known structure. BGSL has a sugar binding site only on one domain, thus impairing its interaction at the cell surface. The adenine binding site in the catalytic chain is defective. Thus, defects in sugar binding as well as adenine binding appear to contribute to the non-toxicity of the lectin. The plasticity of the molecule is mainly caused by the presence of two possible well defined conformations of a surface loop in the lectin chain. One of them is chosen in the sugar complexes, in a case of conformational selection, as the chosen conformation facilitates an additional interaction with the sugar, involving an arginyl residue in the loop. The 𝑁-glycosylation of the lectin involves a plant-specific glycan while that in toxic type H RIPS of known structure involves a glycan which is animal as well as plant specific.</p>

				<title>Occurrence, detection and detoxification of mycotoxins</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0943-0954</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mycotoxins have been identified as important toxins affecting animal species and humans ever since the discovery of aHatoxin B<sub>l</sub> in 1960. Mycotoxigenic fungi are ubiquitous in nature and are held responsible for economic loss as they decrease crop yield and quality of food. The presence of fungi and their mycotoxins are reported not only in food grains but also in medicinal herbs and processed foods. Since prevention is not always possible, detoxification of mycotoxins have been attempted using several means; however, only few have been accepted for practical use, e.g. ammonia in the com industry. Organizations such as the World Health Organization, US Food and Drug Adminis-tration and European Union have set regulations and safety limits of important mycotoxins, viz. aHatoxins, fusarium  toxins, ochratoxin, patulin zearalenone, etc., to ensure the safety of the consumers. This review article is a brief and up-to-date account of the occurrence, detection and detoxification of mycotoxins for those interested in and considering research in this area.</p>

				<title>In search of principles for a Theory of Organisms</title>
				<feature>Review</feature>
				<page>0955-0968</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lacking an operational theory to explain the organization and behaviour of matter in unicellular and multicellular organisms hinders progress in biology. Such a theory should address life cycles from ontogenesis to death. This theory would complement the theory of evolution that addresses phylogenesis, and would posit the oretical extensions to accepted physical principles and default states in order to grasp the living state of matter and define proper biological observables. Thus, we fanout adopting the default state implicit in Darwins theory, namely, cell proliferation with variation plus motility, and a framing principle, namely, life phenomena manifest themselves as non-identical iterations of morphogenetic processes. From this perspective, organisms become a consequence of the inherent variability generated by proliferation, motility and self-organization. Morphogenesis would then be the result of the default state plus physical constraints, like gravity, and those present in living organisms, like muscular tension.</p>
