				<title>Cobalt(III), nickel(II) and ruthenium(II) complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline family of ligands: DNA binding and photocleavage studies</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>DNA binding and photocleavage characteristics of a series of mixedligand complexes of the type [M(phen)<sub>2</sub>LL]<sup>n+</sup> (where M = Co(III), Ni(II) or Ru(II), LL = 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), phenanthroline-dione (phen-dione) or dipyridophenazine (dppz) and  ùëõ = 3 or 2) have been investigated in detail. Various physico-chemical and biochemical techniques including UV/Visible, fluorescence and viscometric titration, thermal denaturation, and differential pulse voltammetry have been employed to probe the details of DNA binding by these complexes; intrinsic binding constants (ùêæ<sub>ùëè</sub>) have been estimated under a similar set of experimental conditions. Analysis of the results suggests that intercalative ability of the coordinated ligands varies as dppz &#62; phen &#60; phen-dione in this series of complexes. While the Co(II) and Ru(II) complexes investigated in this study effect photocleavage of the supercoiled pBR 322 DNA, the corresponding Ni(II) complexes are found to be inactive under similar experimental conditions. Results of detailed investigations carried out inquiring into the mechanistic aspects of DNA photocleavage by [Co(phen)<sub>2</sub> (dppz)]<sup>3+</sup> have also been reported.</p>

				<title>Improved technology for manufacture of carbon electrodes</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0019-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Current industrial carbon electrodes are typically manufactured by blending petroleum coke particles (the filler) with molten coal tar pitch (the binder) and extruding the resultant mix to form the `green electrode‚Äô. This is then baked under controlled conditions. In case of usage as anodes in steel electric furnaces (or as other carbon and graphite products), the electrodes could undergo further processing like pitch impregnation or graphitization. During heat treatment, some of the organics are destructively distilled, vaporized or decomposed, resulting in carbon deposition in the electrode. As the vaporized materials exit the body of the electrode they cause porosity in the walls, which results in reduction in density, current carrying capacity and flexural strength.</p>
					<p>The paper presents investigations to improve some physico-chemical characteristics of these electrodes (such as coefficient of thermal expansion, mechanical strengths, density, pore volume, porosity etc.), obtained in different manufacture steps, by addition of varieties of coal tar pitch. These include attempts to improve the chemical compatibility of the coke-pitch system in the mixture and establish the method and the point of introduction of additive, the concentration required and appropriate analytical control during the entire manufacture. Methods of analysis used include thermogravimetry and porosimetry. The microstructure of the electrodes is investigated through a wide range and the data obtained include pore size and pore volume distribution, surface area, porosity, particle size distribution and type of pores. The overall results clearly indicate better characteristics and performance for electrodes with additives as against electrodes without them, such as lower porosity, lower thermal expansion coefficients and greater mechanical strength. These data are analyzed with respect to the process step and electrode type.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coefficients of characteristic polynomials (CP) of linear polyacenes (LP) have been shown to be obtainable from Pascal‚Äôs triangle by using a graph factorisation and squaring technique. Strong subspectrality existing among the members of the linear polyacene series has been shown from the derivation of the CP‚Äôs. Thus it has been shown that the entire eigenspectrum of an ùëõ-ring LP is included in that of $(2n + 1)$-ring LP. Correspondence between the eigenspectra of linear chains and LP‚Äôs is brought out by a recently developed vertex-alternation and squaring algorithm.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory was applied to the calculation of molecular structures of N-methyl formamide (NMF), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), and N,Ndimethyl acetamide (DMA). DFT calculations on NMF, DMF, and DMA were performed  using a combination of the local functional of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair (VWN) with the  nonlocal exchange functional of Becke and the nonlocal correlational functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP). The adiabatic connection method (ACM) of Becke has also been used, for the first time, for the calculation of molecular structures of NMF, DMF, and DMA. The calculated molecular structures are in excellent agreement with the experimental geometries of NMF and DMA derived from gas-phase electron-diffraction studies. Sparse experimental data on the gas-phase geometry of DMF reported in the literature compares well with the DFT results on DMF. DFT emerges as a powerful method to calculate molecular structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of 10-(3‚Äô-N-morpholinopropyl)phenoxazine [MPP], 10-(4‚Äô-N-morpholinobutyl)phenoxazine [MBP], 10-(3‚Äô-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [MPCP], 10-(3‚Äô-N-piperidinopropyl)-2-chlorophenoxazine [PPCP] or 10-(3‚Äô-N-morpholinopropyl)-2-trifluoromethylphenoxazine [MPTP] with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied by gel filtration and equilibrium dialysis methods. The binding of these modulators, based on dialysis experiments, has been characterized using the following parameters: percentage of bound drug (ùõΩ), the association constant ($K_1$), the apparent binding constant (ùëò) and the free energy change ($\Delta F^\circ$). The binding of phenoxazine derivatives to serum transporter protein, BSA, is correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficient, $\log_{10}~ P$. In addition, effect of the displacing activities of hydroxyzine and acetylsalicylic acid on the binding of phenoxazine derivatives to albumin has been studied. Results of the displacement experiments show that phenoxazine benzene rings and tertiary amines attached to the side chain of the phenoxazine moiety are bound to a hydrophobic area on the albumin molecule.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Laser flash photolysis studies were carried out on two types of silver nanoparticles prepared by  ùõæ-radiolysis of $Ag^+$ solutions in the presence of polyphosphate as the stabiliser. Type I silver nanoparticles displayed a surface plasmon band at 390 nm. Type II silver nanoparticles showed a 390 nm surface plasmon band with a shoulder at 550 nm. On photoexcitation in the surface plasmon band region, using 35 picosecond laser pulses at 355 nm and 532 nm, the type II solutions showed transient bleaching and absorption signals in the 450-900 nm region, which did not decay appreciably up to 5 nanoseconds. These transient changes were found to get annealed in the interval  ùë° where $5 \text{ ns } &#60; t &#60; 100$ ns. Extended photolysis of the nanoparticle solutions with repetitive laser pulses resulted in a decrease in the values of the average particle size which were measured by employing the dynamic light scattering technique.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of formic and oxalic acids by quinolinium fluorochromate (QFC) have been studied in dimethylsulphoxide. The main product of oxidation is carbon dioxide. The reaction is first-order with respect to QFC. Michaelis-Menten type of kinetics were observed with respect to the reductants. The reaction is acid-catalysed and the acid dependence has the form: $k_{\text obs} = a + b[H^+]$. The oxidation of ùõº-deuterioformic acid exhibits a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 6.01$ at 303 K). The reaction has been studied in nineteen different organic solvents and the solvent effect has been analysed using Taft‚Äôs and Swain‚Äôs multiparametric equations. The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect indicates the presence of a symmetrical cyclic transition state in the rate-determining step. Suitable mechanisms have been proposed</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The design and fabrication of a Smalley-type cluster source in combination with a reflectron based time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer are reported. The generation of clusters is based on supersonic jet expansion of the sampling plume. Sample cells for both liquid and solid targets developed for this purpose are described. Two pulsed Nd-YAG lasers are used in tandem, one (532 nm) for target vapourization and the other (355 nm) for cluster ionization. Methanol clusters of nuclearity up to 14 (mass 500 amu) were produced from liquid methanol as the test sample. The clusters were detected with a mass resolution of ~ 2500 in the R-TOF geometry. Carbon clusters up to a nuclearity of 28 were obtained using a polyimide target. The utility of the instrument is demonstrated by carrying out experiments to generate mixed clusters from alcohol mixtures.</p>

					<p>The semiempirical AM1 SCF-MO method is used to study the benzyne mechanism for aromatic nucleophilic substitution of various  ùëö-substituted chlorobenzenes and 3-chloropyridine. The calculations predict that most of the fixed substituents studied here would induce the formation of 2,3-arynes through their electron-withdrawing resonance or inductive effects. The geometry and electronic structure of the 2,3- and 3,4-arynes investigated here, confirm the generally accepted ùëú-benzyne structure postulated for arynes.

				<title>Synthesis of cadmium sulphide in pure and mixed Langmuir-Blodgett films of ùëõ-octadecylsuccinic acid</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0109-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cadmium sulphide (CdS) nanoparticles were grown by the reaction of sodium sulphide (Na<sub>2</sub>S) with Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of cadmium salts of ùëõ-octadecylsuccinic acid (ODSU) and with LB films of ODSU in mixtures of octadecylamine and octadecyl alcohol. The results indicate that heterogeneous nucleation and aggregation in the pure ODSU LB films due to processes like Ostwald ripening are destabilized by the presence of the long-chain amine and alcohol in mixed systems. CdS nanoparticles in the LB films were monitored by UV-visible absorption spectra, which allow an estimation of the size of the particles. The morphology, size and nature of the nanocrystallites formed depend on whether the sulphidation was done on the pure film or in the mixed films. It is seen that particles of size around 1.6 nm were formed in ODSU/octadecylalcohol and ODSU/octadecylamine mixed LB films while in pure ODSU films the size was about 2.7 nm. These films showed typical needle-shaped structures, as observed by the optical microscopic technique. Mean size and morphology were confirmed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, while selective area electron diffraction patterns showed six-fold symmetry and indicated that the CdS crystals grow epitaxially with respect to the monolayer. Further, the crystallisation enhanced in the mixed LB films showed a characteristic zinc oxide (Wurtzite) structure compared with the pure ODSU matrix.</p>

				<title>Molecular complexes of phenols with DDQ</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0119-0125</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular complexes of phenols with DDQ have been studied spectrophotometrically in the temperature range of 10-30&#176;C in a solvent (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) of low polarity under low donor concentrations. All the complexes exhibit one CT band each in the wavelength region where acceptor and donor do not have any absorption. The complexes are inferred to be of the ùúã-ùúã type and have $R_y$ configuration in which the donor molecular orbital encompasses the substituent. The ionization potentials of the donors, the stability constants and thermodynamic parameters of the complexes have been evaluated.</p>

				<title>Effect of piperidones on hydrogen permeation and corrosion inhibition of mild steel in acidic solutions</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0127-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The influence of 3-methyl-2,6-diphenyl piperidin-4-one (MDPO) and 2-phenyl decahydroquinoline-4-one (PDQO) synthesised in the laboratory on hydrogen permeation and corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> has been studied using weight loss and various electrochemical AC and DC corrosion-monitoring techniques. Both the compounds inhibit the corrosion of mild steel in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> Potentiodynamic polarisation studies clearly reveal that they behave predominantly as cathodic inhibitors. The extent of decrease in hydrogen permeation current through steel surfaces has been studied by the hydrogen electropermeation technique. Double layer capacitance ($C_{dl}$) and charge transfer resistance ($R_t$) values are derived from Nyquist plots obtained from AC impedance studies. The adsorption of these compounds on mild steel surfaces from H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> obeys Temkin‚Äôs adsorption isotherm.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0137-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper gives a brief account of the recently introduced Szeged index (Sz). Using this index antitubercular activities of N-2,4-difluorophenyl quinolones are subjected to quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis. The potential of Sz related to the Wiener index (W) is critically discussed. In addition, Huckel molecular orbital energies: $E_{\text{HOMO}}$, $E_{\text{LUMO}}$ and $E_{\text{total}}$ were also used for comparing and modelling antitubercular activities of the quinolones. The results, based on univariate as well as multivariate regressions, have shown that W, Sz and $E_{\text{total}}$ give better results and that the correlations improve in multivariate regression analyses.</p>

				<title>Polyimido sulphur anions S(NR)$^{m-}_n$: Free radicals and coordination behaviour</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0155-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a reaction sequence of amide addition followed by halogen oxidation the triazasulphite S(NR)$^{2-}_3$ and the tetrazasulphate S(NR)$^{2-}_4$ are readily accessible from sulphur diimide S(NR)<sub>2</sub> via sulphur triimide S(NR)<sub>3</sub>. Addition of lithium organics to sulphur triimide provides a general route to triazasulphonates RS(NR)$^{2-}_3$. All these anions resemble potential tripodal coordination behaviour because of their nitrogen donor centres. Furthermore, the sulphur polyimido ligands are capable of responding to the various requirements of different metals (even in mixed metal species) by charge (de)localization. This paper deals with the synthetic routes of the sulphur nitrogen anions and their coordination behaviour. Their reactivity, mainly towards main group metal synthons, is also discussed.</p>

					<p>Platinum group metal chalcogenides find extensive applications in catalysis and in the electronic industry.

				<abstract>
					<p><i>De novo</i> design of artificial proteins is an essential approach to elucidate the principles of protein architecture and to understand specific functions of natural proteins and also to yield novel molecules for medical and industrial aims. We have designed artificial sequences of 153 amino acids to fit the main-chain framework of the sperm whale myoglobin structure based on the knowledge-based energy functions  to evaluate the compatibility between protein tertiary structures and amino acid sequences. The synthesized artificial globins bind a single heme per protein molecule  as designed, which show well-defined electrochemical and spectroscopic features characteristic of proteins with a low-spin heme. Redox and ligand binding reactions of the artificial heme proteins were investigated and these heme-related functions were found to vary with their structural uniqueness. Relationships between the structural and functional properties are discussed.</p>

				<title>Models for the active site in galactose oxidase: Structure, spectra and redox of copper(II) complexes of certain phenolate ligands</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0223-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Galactose oxidase (GOase) is a fungal enzyme which is unusual among metalloenzymes in appearing to catalyse the two electron oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The crystal structure of the enzyme reveals that the coordination geometry of mononuclear copper(II) ion is square pyramidal, with two histidine imidazoles, a tyrosinate, and either H<sub>2</sub>O (ùëùH 7.0) or acetate (from buffer, ùëùH 4.5) in the equatorial sites and a tyrosinate ligand weakly bound in the axial position. This paper summarizes the results of our studies on the structure, spectral and redox properties of certain novel models for the active site of the inactive form of GOase. The monophenolato Cu(II) complexes of the type [Cu(L1)X][H(L1) = 2-(<i>bis</i>(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)aminomethyl)-4-nitrophenol and X<sup>-</sup>= Cl<sup>-</sup><b>1</b>, NCS<sup>-</sup><b>2</b>, CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup><b>3</b>, ClO$_4-$<b>4</b>] reveal a distorted square pyramidal geometry around Cu(II) with an unusual axial coordination of phenolate moiety. The coordination geometry of <b>3</b> is reminiscent of the active site of GOase with an axial phenolate and equatorial CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> ligands. All the present complexes exhibit several electronic and EPR spectral features which are also similar to the enzyme. Further, to establish the structural and spectroscopic consequences of the coordination of two tyrosinates in GOase enzyme, we studied the monomeric copper(II) complexes containing two phenolates and imidazole/pyridine donors as closer structural models for GOase. N,Ndimethylethylenediamine and N,N -dimethylethylenediamine have been used as starting materials to obtain a variety of 2,4-disubstituted phenolate ligands. The X-ray crystal structures of the complexes [Cu(L5)(py)], (<b>8</b>) [H<sub>2</sub> (L5) = N,N-dimethyl-N ,N -<i>bis</i>(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl) ethylenediamine, py = pyridine] and [Cu(L8)(H<sub>2</sub>O)] (<b>11</b>), [H<sub>2</sub>(L8) = N,N -dimethyl-N,N -<i>bis</i>(2-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzyl)ethylenediamine] reveal distorted square pyramidal geometries around Cu(II) with the axial tertiary amine nitrogen and water coordination respectively. Interestingly, for the latter complex there are two different molecules present in the same unit cell containing the methyl groups of the ethylenediamine fragment cis to each other in one molecule and trans to each other in the other. The ligand field and EPR spectra of the model complexes reveal square-based geometries even in solution. The electrochemical and chemical means of generating novel radical species of the model complexes, analogous to the active form of the enzyme is presently under investigation.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0249-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent developments in the area of hybrid structures are overviewed with special emphasis on iron phosphate-oxalate materials. The structure of the iron phosphate-oxalates consists of iron phosphate chains or layers that are connected by oxalate moieties completing the architecture. The compounds exhibit interesting magnetic properties originating from the super-exchange interactions that are predominantly anti-ferromagnetic, involving the iron phosphates and the oxalate moieties. One of the materials, <b>IV</b>, also exhibits interesting adsorptive properties reminiscent of aluminosilicate zeolites. The aluminum phosphate-oxalate,  <b>VII</b>,  indicates that hybrid structures can be formed with zeolite architecture.</p>

				<title>Extended metal-organic solids based on benzenepolycarboxylic and aminobenzoic acids</title>

				<page>0273-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes the recent results obtained in our laboratory on the interaction of polyfunctional ligands with divalent alkaline earth metal ions and a few  divalent transition metal ions. Treatment of MCl<sub>2</sub>$\cdot n$H<sub>2</sub>O (M = Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba) with 2-amino benzoic acid leads to the formation of complexes [Mg(2-aba)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>1</b>), [Ca(2-aba)<sub>2</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]$_{\infty}$ (<b>2</b>), [{Sr(2-aba)<sub>2</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>2</sub>$\cdot$H<sub>2</sub>O)]$_{\infty}$ (<b>3</b>), [Ba(2-aba)<sub>2</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>)]$_{\infty}$ (<b>4</b>), respectively. While the calcium ions in <b>2</b> are hepta-coordinated, the strontium and barium ions in <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> reveal a coordination number of nine apart from additional metal-metal interactions. Apart from the carboxylate functionality, the amino group also binds to the metal centres in the case of strontium and barium complexes <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. Complexes [{Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>}(4-aba)<sub>2</sub>$\cdot$2H<sub>2</sub>O] (<b>5</b>), [Ca(4-aba)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>6</b>) prepared from 4-aminobenzoic acid reveal more open or layered structures. Interaction of 2-mercaptobenzoic acid with MCl<sub>2</sub>$\cdot$6H<sub>2</sub>O (M = Mg, Ca), however, leads to the.oxidation of the thiol group resulting in the disulphide 2,$2'$-dithio<i>bis</i>(benzoic acid). New metal-organic framework based hydrogen-bonded porous solids [{M(btec)(OH<sub>2</sub>)4}$_n\cdot n$(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) 4ùëõH<sub>2</sub>O] (btec = 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylate) (M = Co <b>9</b>; Ni <b>10</b>; Zn <b>11</b>) have been synthesized from 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylic acid in the presence of piperazine. These compounds are made up of extensively hydrogenbonded alternating layers of anionic M-btec co-ordination polymer and piperazinium cations. Compounds <b>2-11</b> described herein form polymeric networks in the solid-state with the aid of different coordinating capabilities of the carboxylate anions hydrogen bonding interactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses coordination-position isomeric M<sup>II</sup>Cu<sup>II</sup> and Cu<sup>II</sup>M<sup>II</sup> complexes, using unsymmetric dinucleating macrocycles (L$^{m;n}$)<sup>2-</sup> ((L<sup>2;2</sup>)<sup>2-</sup>, (L<sup>2;3</sup>)<sup>2-</sup> and (L<sup>2;4</sup>)<sup>2-</sup> that comprise two 2-(N-methyl)-aminomethyl-6-iminomethyl-4-bromophenonate entities, combined through the ethylene chain (ùëö = 2) between the two amine nitrogens and through the ethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene chain (ùëõ = 2, 3 or 4) between the two imine nitrogens. The macrocycles have dissimilar N(amine)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  and N(imine)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> metal-binding sites sharing the phenolic oxygens. The reaction of the mononuclear Cu<sup>II</sup> precursors, [Cu(L<sup>2;2</sup>)], [Cu(L<sup>2;2</sup>)] and [Cu(L<sup>2;2</sup>)], with a M<sup>II</sup> perchlorate and a M<sup>II</sup> acetate salt formed (acetato)M<sup>II</sup> Cu<sup>II</sup> complexes:[CoCu(L<sup>2;2</sup>)(AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> 0 5H<sub>2</sub>O] (<b>1</b>), [NiCu(L<sup>2;2</sup>) (AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (<b>2</b>), [ZnCu(L<sup>2;2</sup>((AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (<b>3</b>), [CoCu(L<sup>2;3</sup>)(AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> 0 5H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>4</b>), [NiCu(L<sup>2;3</sup>)(AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (<b>5</b>), [ZnCu(L<sup>2;3</sup>)(AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> 0 5H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>6</b>), [CoCu(L<sup>2;4</sup>)(AcO)(DMF)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (<b>7</b>), [NiCu(L<sup>2;4</sup>)(AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> 2DMF (<b>8</b>) and [ZnCu(L<sup>2;4</sup>)(AcO)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (<b>9</b>) (the formulation [M$_a$M$_b$ (L$^{m;n}$)]<sup>2+</sup> means that M$_a$ resides in the aminic site and M$_b$ in the iminic site). The site selectivity of the metal ions is demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic studies for <b>2</b> MeOH, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b>. An (acetato)Cu<sup>II</sup>Zn<sup>II</sup> complex, [CuZn(L<sup>2;3</sup>)(AcO)]ClO<sup>4</sup> (<b>10</b>), was obtained by the reaction of [PbCu(L<sup>2;3</sup>)]-(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> with ZnSO<sub>4</sub> 4H<sub>2</sub>O, in the presence of sodium acetate. Other complexes of the Cu<sup>II</sup>M<sup>II</sup> type were thermodynamically unstable to cause a scrambling of metal ions. The Cu migration from the iminic site to the aminic site in the synthesis of <b>10</b> is explained by the `kinetic macrocyclic effect‚Äô. The coordination-position isomers, <b>6</b> and <b>10</b>, are differentiated by physicochemical properties.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence metrology of silica sol-gels - The effect of D<sub>2</sub>O and inorganic salts</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0311-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed a new method for measuring in-situ the growth of the nanometre-size silica particles which lead to the formation of sol-gel glasses. This technique is based on the decay of fluorescence polarisation anisotropy due to Brownian rotation of dye molecules bound to the particles. Results to date give near √•ngstrom resolution and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach both for providing industrial quality control and helping fundamental research. Our approach has several key advantages over traditional techniques for nanometre metrology, such as small angle X-ray and neutron scattering and electron microscopy. In this paper we present silica particle growth dynamics in a hydrogel as detected by two near-infrared dyes, the effect of adding D<sub>2</sub>O on the hydrodynamic radius and the effect of salt addition.</p>

				<title>Stereochemical trends of metal derivatives of some heterocyclic-2-thiones and thiosemicarbazones</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0323-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of heterocyclic thiones/thiosemicarbazones with metals has been the subject of several investigations as these ligands contain chemically active groups, -N(H)-C(=S)- -N=C(-SH)- ,and are useful model compounds for sulphur-containing analogues of purine and pyrimidine bases. Heterocylic-2-thiones  bind to metals in several ways and lead to the formation of monomeric or polymeric complexes. For example, the simplest prototype of heterocylic-2-thiones, namely, pyridine-2-thione has several ways of binding, notably, terminal S-bonding and S-bridging (in neutral form), while in anionic form the modes are terminal S-bonding, S-bridging, N,S-chelation, N,S-bridging, N,S-chelation-cum-S-bridging and N,S-bridging-cum-S-bridging. Similarly, thiosemicarbazones bind to metals as S-bonded unidentates or N,S-chelates. In this paper, the chemistry of pyridine-2-thione, its N-oxide, 2-(benzylthio)pyridine-1-oxide thione with metals like iron(II), ruthenium(II), nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II), copper(I), copper(II), silver(I) and mercury(II) is briefly described. As regards thiosemicarbazones, focus is only on two compounds, namely organomercury(II) and organothallium(III). A variety of new molecules, well characterised by NMR and X-ray crystallography, is introduced.</p>

				<page>0439-0448</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isomorphously substituted molecular sieves, MAPO-31, NAPO-31 and ZAPO-31, were prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions from gels containing sources of aluminium, phosphorus, appropriate metal and dipropylamine (DPA), presumably acting as a structure-directing template. They were characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), ESR, Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) and diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. In the XRD, the peak at 2 = 16 7¬∞ of the metal substituted AlPO-31 is more intense than that of pure AlPO-31 suggesting preferential occupation of the plane corresponding to it as compared to other planes. The O-H stretch in the IR spectra of the metal-substituted molecular sieves is blue-shifted with respect to the parent AlPO-31 molecular sieves possibly due to metal substitution. The g values obtained from the ESR spectra of MAPO-31 and NAPO-31 also substantiate framework substitution. Ethylation of toluene was carried out between 300 and 450¬∞C over the above catalysts as a model test reaction. The high toluene conversion over metal-substituted  molecular sieves proves the isomorphic substitution of metal ions in the AlPO-31 framework.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This article illustrates the application of a 2&#37; ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate-cross-linked polystyrene support (EGDMA-PS) in manual solid phase peptide synthesis. This copolymer has been characterised and optimised for peptide synthesis by performing the synthesis of a few model peptides and two biologically important peptides. EGDMA-cross-linked polystyrene support was prepared by the suspension polymerisation of the monomers EGDMA and styrene. EGDMA-PS resin undergoes facile swelling in a variety of solvents, both polar and nonpolar, used in peptide synthesis. The polymer was functionalised by Friedel-Crafts chloromethylation reaction. Peptides were assembled on a 2&#37; cross-linked chloromethyl polymer support of capacity 1 63 mmol Cl/g. The biological peptides synthesised are an 11-residue peptide ATP binding site of the CDC2 kinase and a difficult sequence-a nineresidue peptide  34-42 corresponding to a portion of the hydrophobic terminus of the-amyloid protein  1-42. After synthesis, the peptides were cleaved from the support by treating with neat TFA. Purity of the peptides obtained in good yield was checked by TLC and HPLC methods and found to be fairly high.</p>

				<title>Charge-transfer spectra of ferrocene in halocarbon solvents under photoexcitation</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0475-0485</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The changes in the electronic absorption spectra of ferrocene in the halocarbon solvents chloroform and carbontetrachloride have been investigated under photoexcitation in nitrogen atmosphere. Photoexcitations have been made with monochromatic light (using an Xe-source and a monochromator), at intervals of a few nanometers in the spectral range 220-750 nm. Analysing the spectra  by a modified method the position of the charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) band has been located for both the solvents. The position of the CTTS band in the case of carbontetrachloride solution located (320 nm) by the present study is different from the previously reported value (307 nm), while from the previous studies the position of the CTTS band in the case of the spectra of ferrocene in chloroform was not clear. From the present investigation, the changes in spectra after photoexcitation studied as a function, the concentration of ferrocene in the solution and the time (duration) of photoexcitations, have been observed to be systematic. Using the position of the new band (320 nm) for the CTTS transition in the case of carbontetrachloride, ionization potential of ferrocene has been estimated and the estimated value has shown excellent agreement with the experimental value indicating the exactness of the newly located CTTS band position.</p>

				<page>0487-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pulse radiolysis technique has been employed to investigate the reaction of DNA-minor-groove ligand  <i>bis</i>benzimidazole Hoechst 33258 with pyrimidine and purine nucleotide-derived radicals. Formation of an N-centred Hoechst-33258 radical is observed. Bimolecular rate constants and the yields of Hoechst-33258 radical have been evaluated. While the rate constant for the reaction of pyrimidine-derived radicals with Hoechst-33258 remained the same (1-2) &#215; $10^9$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, the yields of the Hoechst-33258 radical varied from 25&#37; (5 -cytidine monophosphate) to 75&#37; (5 -guanosine monophosphate) under anoxic conditions. The rate constant values for the reaction of purine-derived radicals with Hoechst-33258, under oxic and anoxic conditions, remained the same whereas with pyrimidine-derived radicals, the rate constant value under oxic conditions was about two orders of magnitude lower than under anoxic conditions. The difference in the yields of Hoechst-33258 radical with various nucleotide-derived radicals suggest the formation of different types of radicals and that the reaction mainly occurs by electron transfer from Hoechst-33258 to the nucleotide radicals.</p>

				<title>The kinetics and mechanism of induced thermal decomposition of peroxomonosulphate by phase transfer catalysts</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0497-0505</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of induced decomposition of potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS) by the phase transfer catalysts (PTC), viz. tetrabutylammonium chloride [TBAC] and tetrabutylphosphonium chloride [TBPC] have been investigated. The effect of [PMS], [PTC], ionic strength of the medium and temperature on the rate of decomposition of PMS was studied. The rate of decomposition of PMS was monitored under pseudo-first-order condition at a constant temperature (50 ¬± 0 1&#176;C). The rate of decomposition was first order with respect to PMS for TBAC and half order for TBPC. The order with respect of PTC was found to be unity for TBAC and half order for TBPC. A suitable kinetic scheme has been proposed to account for the experimental data and its significance is discussed.</p>

					<p>The kinetics of the oxidation of nickel (II) hexaaza and nickel (II) pentaaza macrocycles by the peroxydisulphate anion, S<sub>2</sub>O$_8^{2-}$, were studied in aqueous media. Effect of ùëùH on reaction rate was also studied. The rate increases with increase of S<sub>2</sub>O$_8^{2-}$ concentration. Rates are almost independent of acid between  ùëùH 4 and 2, giving overall a relatively simple second-order rate law followed by oxidation within the ion pair solvent shell. Using rate = +1/2 d[Ni(L)<sup>3+</sup>]/dt = k[Ni(L)<sup>2+</sup>][S_2O$_8^{2-}$], oxidation rate constants were determined.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>2-(Arylazo)pyrimidines (aapm) are N,N -chelating ligands and synthesise orange-red complexes of composition [Pd(aapm)Cl<sub>2</sub>],  <b>1</b>, with Pd(MeCN)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> in MeCN. The complex has  <i>cis</i>-PdCl<sub>2</sub> configuration [(Pd‚àíCl): 340, 360 cm<sup>-1</sup>]. The treatment of Tollen‚Äôs reagent (`AgOH‚Äô) leads to chelatative hydroxylation in the pendant aryl ring, affording a green phenolato complex, Pd(aapmO)Cl, <b>5</b> (aapmO is deprotonated 2-((8-hydroxo)arylazo)pyrimidine). The reaction is also carried out by controlled addition of dilute sodium hydroxide in air or by the addition of PhIO/ùëö-chloroperbenzoic acid to a MeCN suspension of the complex. A single Pd-Cl stretch at 360 cm<sup>-1</sup> supports the composition of phenolato complex. Unlike Pd(aapm)Cl<sub>2</sub> the hydroxylated product, Pd(aapmO)Cl, has a structured intense absorption in the visible region near 670 nm. The Pd-Cl bond in Pd(aapmO)Cl is highly sensitive to nucleophilic substitution and slowly hydrolyses in aqueous medium.</p>

				<page>0543-0550</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A search for non-cyanide plating baths for copper resulted in the development of alkaline copper complex baths containing trisodium citrate [TSC] and triethanolamine [TEA]. Voltammetric studies were carried out on platinum to understand the electrochemical behaviour of these complexes. In TSC solutions, the deposition of copper involves the slow formation of a monovalent species. Adsorption of this species obeys Langmuir isotherm. In TEA solutions the deposition involves the formation of monovalent ions obeying the non-activated Temkin isotherm. Conversion of divalent to monovalent copper is also slow. In TEA and TSC alkaline copper solutions, the predominant species that undergo stepwise reduction contain only TEA ligands</p>

				<title>Oxidation of caffeine by phosphate radical anion in aqueous solution under anoxic conditions</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0551-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The photooxidation of caffeine in presence of peroxydiphosphate (PDP) in aqueous solution at natural ùëùH (‚àº7 5) has been carried out in a quantum yield reactor using a high-pressure mercury lamp. The reactions  were followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of caffeine at {}_${\max}$ (272 nm). The rates of reaction were calculated under different experimental conditions. The quantum yields were calculated from the rates of oxidation of caffeine and the intensity of light at 254 nm which was measured by using peroxydisulphate solution as a standard chemical actinometer. The reaction rates of oxidation of caffeine by PDP increase with increase in [PDP] as well as with increase in light intensity, while they are independent of [caffeine]. The quantum yields of oxidation of caffeine by PDP are independent of [PDP] as well as light intensity. However, quantum yields of oxidation of caffeine by PDP increase with increase in caffeine concentration. On the basis of these experimental results and product analysis, a probable mechanism has been suggested in which PDP is activated to phosphate radical anions (PO$_4^{.2-}$) by direct photolysis of PDP and also by the sensitizing effect of caffeine. The phosphate radical anions thus produced react with caffeine by electron transfer reaction, resulting in the formation of caffeine radical cation, which deprotonates in a fast step to produce C8OH adduct radicals. These radicals might react with PDP to give final product 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid and PO$_4^{.2-}$ radicals, the latter propagates the chain reaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reactions were sensitive between seven rare earth (RE) metals Nd(III), La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), Sm(III), Eu(III) and Gd(III) and dibromo-ùëù-methylmethylsulfonazo (DBMMSA) in acidic solution. The spectral correction method has been applied in the determination of properties of RE complexes instead of ordinary spectrophotometry. Composition ratios, real molar absorptivities ( ) and stepwise stability constants (ùêæ) of each of the RE complexes were determined easily because the method eliminated the absorption influence of excess of ligand on complex. Results showed that the cumulative  ùêæ values of the complexes were between 3 91 &#215; 10<sup>14</sup> and 2 34 &#215; 10<sup>28</sup> and the real (not apparent) absorptivity between 8 85 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> and 2 12 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> l mol<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> at 640 nm.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and equilibria of the axial ligation of alkyl(aquo)cobaloximes by imidazole and cyanide have been measured spectrophotometrically in aqueous solutions of ionic strength 1.0 M at 25&#176;C as a function of ùëùH. Comparison of $K_{\text{IMD}}$ and $K_{\text{CN}}$- of CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> and BrCH<sub>2</sub> cobaloximes indicates that their stability is in the order BrCH<sub>2</sub> &#62; CH<sub>3</sub> &#62; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>. As the electron-withdrawing capacity of the alkyl group <i>trans</i> to water increases, the electron density of the cobalt(III) decreases and thus it becomes a stronger Lewis acid and binds more strongly to imidazole and cyanide. The association and dissociation rate constants are better correlated to the relative softness of the ligand showing that cyanide binds 30 times faster than imidazole. These complexes are isolated and are characterized by IR and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra.</p>

					<p>Synthesis and characterization of some phenyl azo substituted tetraaza macrocyclic complexes of Ni(II) are reported. Electrochemical behaviour of these macrocyclic complexes has been examined using polarographic, voltammetric and spectroscopic techniques. These studies show that both the ligand and the metal are electrochemically active. The electrochemical behaviour of the azo function has been shown to occur through a single four-electron process. When a nitro group is also present, the nitro function of the azo moiety is reduced in a six-electron cathodic wave.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of oxidation of N-methyl and N-ethyl aniline by peroxomono-phosphoric acid (PMPA) in aqueous and 5&#37; (v/v)  acetonitrile medium respectively have been studied in presence of anionic micelles of sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) at different  ùëùH. Oxidation rate of both the substrates increases up to a certain [SLS] much below the critical micellar concentration (cmc) after which the rate is retarded. Kinetic data have been used to compute the binding constants of both substrate and oxidant with the micelle. A scheme explaining the kinetic data has been proposed.</p>

					<p><i>Ab initio</i> $\text{HF}/6-31+G^{\ast}$, $\text{MP}2/6-31+G^{\ast}$, $\text{B3LYP}/6-31+G^{\ast}$ level calculations have been performed on HSe-NH<sub>2</sub> to estimate the Se-N rotational barriers and N-inversion barriers. Two conformers have been found with syn and anti arrangement of the NH<sub>2</sub> hydrogens with respect to Se-H bond. The N inversion barriers in selenamide are 1 65, 2 47, 1 93 kcal/mol and the Se-N rotational barriers are 6 58, 6 56 and 6 12 kcal/mol respectively at $\text{HF}/6-31+G^{\ast}$, $\text{MP}2/6-31+G^{\ast}$ and $\text{B3LYP}/6-31+G^{\ast}$ levels respectively.

				<title>Peroxidase-like catalytic activities of ionic metalloporphyrins supported on functionalised polystyrene surface</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0001-0009</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metalloderivatives of anionic tetrasulphonated tetraphenylporphyrin (MTPPS, M = Mn(III), Fe(III) and Co(III)) were synthesized and immobilized on cationically functionalised divinylbenzene(DVB)-crosslinked polystyrene(PS). These supported catalysts (PS-MTPPS) were found to exhibit peroxidase-like activity. The co-oxidation of 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was attempted with these catalysts to mimic this enzyme function. The catalytic efficiency of all these immobilized MTPPS was found to be superior to the corresponding unsupported MTPPS in solution. The effect of the central metal ion of the porphyrin, ùëùH of the reaction medium and also the temperature effect are investigated. The ideal  ùëùH was seen to be in the 8 0-8 5 range, with maximum effect at 8 2. The efficiency order for the various PS-MTPPS was seen to be Co&#62;Mn&#62;Fe, with CoTPPS showing efficiency comparable to that of horseradish peroxidase. The catalytic efficiency was found to be increasing with temperature for all the catalysts. The re-usability of these PS-MTPPS systems for peroxidase-like activity was also studied and it was found that they exhibited a very high degree of recyclability without much poisoning.</p>

				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc finger domains consist of sequences of amino acids containing cysteine and histidine residues tetrahedrally coordinated to a zinc ion. The role of zinc in a DNA binding finger was considered purely structural due to the absence of redox chemistry in zinc. However, whether other metals e.g. Co(II) or Cd(II) can substitute Zn(II) is not settled. For an answer the detailed interaction of Co(II) and Cd(II) with cysteine methylester and histidine methylester has been investigated as a model for the zinc  core in zinc fingers. The study was extended to different temperatures to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters associated with these interactions. The results suggest that zinc has a unique role.</p>

				<title>Kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of some diols by benzyltrimethylammonium tribromide</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0043-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of oxidation of five vicinal and four non-vicinal diols, and two of their monoethers by benzyltrimethylammonium tribromide (BTMAB) have been studied in 3:7 ($v/v$) acetic acid-water mixture. The vicinal diols yield the carbonyl compounds arising out of the glycol bond fission while the other diols give the hydroxycarbonyl compounds. The reaction is first-order with respect to BTMAB. Michaelis-Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to diol. Addition of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride does not affect the rate. Tribromide ion is postulated to be the reactive oxidizing species. Oxidation of [1,1,2,2-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>4</sub>] ethanediol shows the absence of a kinetic isotope effect. The reaction exhibits substantial solvent isotope effect. A mechanism involving a glycol-bond fission has been proposed for the oxidation of the vicinal diols. The other diols are oxidized by a hydride ion transfer to the oxidant, as are the monohydric alcohols.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements of D<sub>2</sub>O solutions (0 1 M) of sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) were carried out at ùëá = 298 K. Under compositions very much above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the bile salt micelle size growths were monitored by adopting Hayter-Penfold type analysis of the scattering data. NaC and NaDC solutions show presence of correlation peaks at ùëÑ = 0 12 and 0 1 √Ö<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Monodisperse ellipsoids of the micelles produce best fits. For NaC and NaDC systems, aggregation number (9 0, 16 0), fraction of the free counterions per micelle (0 79, 0 62), semi-minor (8 0 √Ö) and semi-major axes (18 4, 31 7 √Ö) values for the micelles were deduced. Extent of micellar growth was studied using ESR correlation time measurements on a suitable probe incorporating NaC and NaDC micelles. The growth parameter (axial ratio) values were found to be 2 3 and 4 0 for NaC and NaDC systems respectively. The values agree with those of SANS.</p>

				<page>0095-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Compounds of a new smectogenic homologous series of  -methylcinnamates were prepared by condensing different 4-ùëõ-alkoxybenzoyl chloride with methoxyethyl  <i>trans</i>-4-hydroxy- -methylcinnamate. In this series, the first six members are non-mesogenic.  ùëõ-Heptyloxy derivative exhibits monotropic smectic A phase whereas rest of the members exhibit enantiotropic smectic A mesophase. The compounds are characterized by combination of elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques. Enthalpies of few homologues are measured by DSC techniques. Fluorescent properties are also observed. The thermal stabilities of the present series are compared with those of other structurally related mesogenic homologous series.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of formic and oxalic acids by benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate (BTMACI), in the presence of zinc chloride, leads to the formation of carbon dioxide. The reaction is first order with respect to BTMACI, zinc chloride and organic acid. Oxidation of deuteriated formic acid indicates the presence of a kinetic isotope effect. Addition of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride enhances the rate. It is proposed that the reactive oxidizing species is [(PhCH<sub>2</sub>Me<sub>3</sub>N)<sup>+</sup> (IZn<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>)<sup>‚àí</sup>]. Suitablemechanisms have been proposed.</p>

				<title>Anomalous spreading behaviour of polyethyleneglycoldistearate monolayers at air/water interface</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0119-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spreading behaviour of the dimeric surfactant polyethyleneglycoldistearate (PEGDS) monolayer at air/water interface has been studied using surface pressure-area ( -$A$) isotherms as a function of temperature. The isotherms show a plateau suggesting a transition between a liquid expanded (LE) and a condensed state. The condensed state possibly arises due to nucleation and growth of multilayers from the monolayer. Isobaric measurements of both  $A-T$ and  $-T$ at constant area show transitions at $T = 295$ K. These plots suggest a melting followed by formation of condensed microcrystallites. Structure optimization carried out using various angles of orientation of the alkyl tails with respect to the backbone in PEGDS reveals tilt transitions of the tails in different states which can be related to the packing behaviour seen in the isotherms. Optical microscopy has been used to confirm the structures in these states.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Multiphoton dissociation/ionization has been studied for CH<sub>3</sub>SCH<sub>3</sub> at 355 and 532 nm using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The major ion signals observed at 355 nm are C<sup>+</sup>, CH$_3^+$, HCS<sup>+</sup>, CH<sub>2</sub>S<sup>+</sup>, CH<sub>3</sub>S<sup>+</sup> and CH<sub>3</sub>SCH$_3^+$. Power dependence studies at 355 nm show a  (2 + 1) REMPI process for the formation of parent ion. Peaks at  $m/e = 46$, 47 and 61 show two-photon laser power dependence whereas $m/e = 15$ and 45 peaks show four-photon dependence. However, in 532 nm photoionisation, no parent ion signal is observed. A peak at $m/e = 35$ corresponding to SH$_3^+$ has been observed. SH$_3^+$ has been suggested to originate from CH<sub>3</sub>SCH$_2^+$ via a cyclic transition state. Photoionisation results of CH<sub>3</sub>SCH<sub>3</sub> have been compared with those of CH<sub>3</sub>SSCH<sub>3</sub>, at these two wavelengths.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation of nine primary aliphatic alcohols by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) in aqueous acetic acid leads to the formation of the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction is first order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis-Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to alcohols. The reaction failed to induce the polymerization of acrylonitrile. Tetrabutylammonium chloride has no effect on the reaction rate. The proposed reactive oxidizing species is the tribromide ion. The oxidation of [1,1-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]ethanol exhibits a substantial kinetic isotope effect. The effect of solvent composition indicates that the rate increases with increase in the polarity of the solvent. The reaction is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of substituents. A mechanism involving transfer of a hydride ion in the ratedetermining step has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Copper sulphide clusters were prepared in Langmuir-Blodgett films of copper complexes of amphiphilic Schiff bases-3,4-dimethoxy-N-benzylidene hexadeylamine (<b>I</b>) and 3,4-dimethoxy-N-benzylidene-4 -(hexadecylamino) benzylamine (<b>II</b>) The clusters obtained were analysed using UV-Vis spectroscopy and optical microscopy. Brewster angle microscopic studies on monolayers of  <b>I</b> and  <b>II</b> at air/water interface showed formation of needle-like domains which seem to cluster faster in  <b>I</b> than in <b>II</b>. Atomic force microscopy  (AFM) studies also showed fairly uniform sized clusters in <b>II</b> whereas in the case of <b>I</b> they seem to show varying sizes. From the results it is concluded that  -elongation in the polar head groups leads to controlled cluster sizes in compound <b>II</b> as compared to those in compound <b>I</b>.</p>

				<title>TRANES analysis of the fluorescence of nile red in organized molecular assemblies confirms emission from two species</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0157-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-resolved area normalized emission spectroscopy (TRANES) is a new method for the analysis of fluorescence of dyes in complex chemical and biological systems (A S R Koti, M M G Krishna and N Periasamy, 2001,  <i>J. Phys. Chem.</i> <b>105</b>, 1767). The model-free method extends the power of time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analysis and removes the ambiguity in the interpretation when the emission spectrum is time-dependent. Observation of an isoemissive point in TRANES analysis of fluorescence is an unambiguous indication for the presence of two emissive species in the sample. The isoemissive point occurs at a wavelength where the ratio of the radiative rates of the two species is equal to the ratio of their total radiative rates. The polarity-sensitive nile red dye shows timedependent emission spectra in the organized bilayer assemblies of TX micelle and bilayer egg-phosphotidylcholine (egg-PC) membrane. Time-dependent spectra in complex systems support many important models (solvation model and heterogeneity in the ground and/or excited state). TRANES analysis shows that the fluorescence emission of nile red in TX micelle and egg-PC membrane is due to two emissive species solubilized in different sites.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Excess molar volumes ($V^E_m$) and viscosities (ùúÇ) of the binary mixtures of 1,2-diethoxyethane with di-, tri- and tetrachloromethane have been measured at 298.15 K and atmospheric pressure over the entire mole fraction range. The deviations in viscosities (ùõ•lnùúÇ) and excess energies of activation ($\Delta G^{*E}$) for viscous flow have been calculated from the experimental data. The Prigogine-Flory-Patterson (PFP) model has been used to calculate $V^E_m$, and the results have been compared with experimental data. The Bloomfield and Dewan model has been used to calculate viscosity coefficients and these have also been compared with experimental data for the three mixtures. The results have been discussed in terms of dipole-dipole interactions between 1,2-diethoxyethane and chloroalkanes and their magnitudes decreasing with the dipole character of the molecules. A short comparative study with results for mixtures with polyethers and chloroalkanes is also described.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0235-0244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laser-induced fluorescence excitation and IR-UV double resonance spectroscopy have been used to determine the hydrogen-bonded structure of benzyl alcohol-ammonia (1:1) cluster in a jet-cooled molecular beam. In addition, $ab$ <i>initio</i> quantum chemical calculations have been performed at HF/6-31G and HF/6-31G(d, p) levels for different ground state equilibrium structures of the cluster to correlate the calculated OH and NH frequencies and their intensities with experimental results. The broad red-shifted OH-stretching mode in the IR-UV double resonance spectrum suggests strong hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl hydrogen and the lone pair of the ammonia nitrogen. The position and intensity distribution of the calculated NH and OH modes for the minimum-energy gauche form at HF/6-31$G$ level have better correlation with the experimental results compared to other calculated ground state equilibrium conformers. These results lead to the conclusion that the minimum energy gauche form of the cluster is populated in the jet-cooled condition.</p>

Both the ligands and complexes were characterized by spectral studies. Cyclic voltammetric investigation of these complexes revealed that the reaction process involves two successive quasireversible one-electron steps at different potentials. The first reduction potential is sensitive to electronic effects of the substituents at the aromatic ring of the ligand system, shifting to positive potentials when the substituents are replaced by more electrophilic groups. EPR studies indicate very weak interaction between the two copper atoms. Various covalency parameters have been calculated.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study of the mechanism of proton transfer in tautomeric systems: Alloxan</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0297-0306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Semiempirical SCF-MO studies of tautomerism in alloxan preclude the possibility of direct proton transfer in the gas phase due to the strain in the four-centred transition state, in which the proton being transferred is forced to come close to the positively charged carbon atom at the opposite corner of the four-membered ring. However, in aqueous solution, the activation barrier reduces appreciably, not only due to reduction in strain, but also due to charge separation in the transition state, which is stabilized due to ionic resonance. The N-H bond is almost broken, while the O-H bond is only partially formed in the transition state. The other stabilizing effect in aqueous solution is due to bulk solvent dielectric effects, which stabilize the transition state to a greater extent due to its higher dipole moment. Although the transition states for proton transfer to the neighbouring oxygen atoms on either side have comparable energies, as the mechanisms of proton transfer leading to the formation of the 2-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy tautomers are similar, bulk solvent effects are larger in the latter due to the higher dipole moment of the transition state. The reason is the almost complete separation of the two entities, i.e. the alloxan anion and the hydronium ion in the latter case, indicating that in this case a dissociative mechanism of the kind encountered in acid-base equilibria is operating.</p>

				<page>0307-0324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Detailed X-ray crystallographic investigation of the reactive - and the unreactive -polymorphs of  ùëú-ethoxy cinnamic acid has been carried out along with that of the photodimer,  -truxillic acid. The molecule is quite planar in the -form, but in the  -form, the side groups deviate significantly from the plane of the benzene ring.  The carboxylic groups form normal cyclic hydrogen bonds in the  -form and near-symmetric hydrogen bonds in the  -form. The infrared spectrum of the  -form shows the characteristic features of the cyclic dimer, but that of the  -form is entirely different, marked by the absence of the O-H stretching band in the 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup> region. Charge density analysis throws some light on the structure and reactivity of the molecule in the two forms. The near-symmetric hydrogen bond in the  -form is ionic and appears to restrict conjugation by way of distorting the molecule. This unusual feature keeps the cinnamoyl double bonds away from each other, rendering it photochemically unreactive. In the  -form, however, the double bonds have a closer approach. The cyclobutyl ring of the photodimer consists of weak single bonds, with the new pair being slightly longer</p>

				<page>0325-0332</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of oxidation of acidic amino acids (glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp)) by sodium N-bromobenzenesulphonamide (bromamine-B or BAB) has been carried out in aqueous HClO<sub>4</sub> medium at 30&#176;C. The rate shows firstorder dependence each on [BAB]$_o$ and [amino acid]$_o$ and inverse first-order on [H<sup>+</sup>]. At [H<sup>+</sup>] &#62; 0 60 mol dm<sup>-3</sup>, the rate levelled off indicating zero-order dependence on [H<sup>+</sup>] and, under these conditions, the rate has fractional order dependence on [amino acid]. Succinic and malonic acids have been identified as the products. Variation of ionic strength and addition of the reaction product benzenesulphonamide or halide ions had no significant effect on the reaction rate. There is positive effect of dielectric constant of the solvent. Proton inventory studies in H<sub>2</sub>O-D<sub>2</sub>O mixtures showed the involvement of a single exchangeable proton of the OH<sup>-</sup> ion in the transition state. Kinetic investigations have revealed that the order of reactivity is Asp &#62; Glu. The rate laws proposed and derived in agreement with experimental results are discussed.</p>

				<title>TEA CO<sub>2</sub> laser-induced reaction of CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> with CF<sub>2</sub>HCl: A mechanistic study</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0333-0342</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dissociation of nitromethane has been observed when a mixture of CF<sub>2</sub>HCl and CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> is irradiated using pulsed TEA CO<sub>2</sub> laser at 9R (24) line (1081 cm<sup>-1</sup>), which is strongly absorbed by CF<sub>2</sub>HCl but not by CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Under low laser fluence conditions, only nitromethane dissociates, whereas at high fluence CF<sub>2</sub>HCl also undergoes dissociation, showing that dissociation occurs via the vibrational energy transfer processes from the TEA CO<sub>2</sub> laser-excited CF<sub>2</sub>HCl to CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Time-resolved infrared fluorescence from vibrationally excited CF<sub>2</sub>HCl and CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> molecules as well as UV absorption of CF<sub>2</sub> radicals are carried out to elucidate the dynamics of excitation/dissociation and the chemical reactions of the dissociation products.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of  L-methionine by iron(III)-1, 10-phenanthroline complex have been studied in perchloric acid medium. The reaction is first order each in iron(III) and methionine. Increase in [phenanthroline] increases the rate while increase in [HClO<sub>4</sub>] decreases it. While the reactive species of the substrate is the zwitterionic form, that of the oxidant is [Fe(phen)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>. The proposed mechanism leads to the rate law $$\dfrac{d[Fe(phen)^{2+}_3]}{dt} = \dfrac{k_2 K_4 K_3 K^2_2 [Fe^{III}] [\text{phen}^2] [\text{Met}]}{(1+K_1 [H^+]) ([H^+]^2 + K_4 K_3 K^2_2[\text{phen}]^2)}.$$</p>

				<title>Basic building units, self-assembly and crystallization in the formation of complex inorganic open architectures</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0363-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Careful investigations of open-framework metal phosphates reveal that the formation of these complex architectures is likely to involve a process wherein one-dimensional ladders or chains, and possibly zero-dimens ional  monomers, transform to higher dimensional structures. The one-dimensional ladder appears to be the primary building unit of these structures. At one stage of the building-up process, spontaneous self-assembly of a low-dimensional structure such as the ladder seems to occur, followed by crys tallization of a two- or  three-dimensional structure.  Accordingly, many of the higher dimensional structures retain the structural features of the 1D structure, indicating the occurrence of self-assembly. These findings mark the beginnings of our understan ding of complex supramolecular inorganic materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis and characterization of nanotubes and nanowires constitute an important part of nanoscience  since these materials are essential bui lding units for several devices. We have prepared aligned  carbon nanotube bundles and Y-junction nanotubes by the pyrolysis of appropriate organic precursors. The aligned bundles are useful for field  emission display while the Y-junction nanotubes are likely to be useful as nanochips since they exhibit diode properties at the junction. By making use of carbon nanotubes, nanowires of metals, metal oxides and GaN have be en obt a ined. Both the oxide and GaN nanowires are single crystalline. Gold nanowires exhibit plasmon bands varying markedly with the aspect ratio. GaN nanowires show excellent photoluminescence characteristics. It has been possible to synthesise nanotubes and nanowires of metal chalcogenides by employing different strategies.</p>

				<title>Relaxation in binary mixtures: Non-ideality, heterogeneity and re-entrance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0393-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binary mixtures show many kinds of fascinating dynamical behaviour which has eluded microscopic description till very recently. In this work we show that much of the anomalous behaviour can be explained by building suitable models and  carrying out theoretical and simulation studies. Specifically, three well-known problems have been addressed here. (a) Non-ideality in composition dependence of viscosity, (b) re-entrant behaviour of orientational relaxation, and (c) heterogeneity in supercooled binary mixtures. The physical origin of the dynamical behaviour of binary mixtures can be understood in terms of composition fluctuation, a study of which has also been presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Electron-electron interactions in the chemical bond: ``1/3‚Äù Effect in the bond length of hydrogen molecule</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0415-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The  prominent  ``1/3‚Äù  effect  observed in the Hall effect plateaus of twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems has been postulated to indicating 1/3 fractional charge quasiparticle excitations arising from electron-electron interactions. Tunneling shot-noise experiments on 2DEF exhibiting fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) shows evidence for tunnelling of particles with $e$ and  $e/3$ charges for a constant band mass. A "1/3‚Äù effect in the hydrogen molecule is seen in as much as its internuclear distance, $d_{H-H} = D^- + D^+,$ with $|D^+/D^-| = 1/3$. This is examined in terms of electron-electron interactions involving electron- and hole quasiparticles, ($e^-$) and ($h^+$), equivalent to those observed in FQHE shot-noise experiments. The ($e/m$) ratio of the ($e^-$) and ($h^+$) quasiparticles is kept at 1: -3. Instead of a 2DEG, these particles are treated as being in flat Bohr orbits. A treatment in the language of charge-flux tube composites for the hydrogen atom as well as the hydrogen molecule is attempted. Such  treatment  gives important insights into changes in chemical potential and bond energy on crossing a phase boundary during the atom-bond transition as well as on models for FQHE itself.</p>

					<p>Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a unique method to obtain epitaxial multi-component oxide films. Highly stoichiometric, nearly single crystal-like materials in the form of films can be made by PLD. Oxides which are synthesized at  high oxygen pressure  can be made into films at low oxygen partial pressure. Epitaxial thin films of high  $T_c$ cuprates, metallic, ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, dielectric oxides, super conduc tor-metal-superconductor Josephson junctions and oxide superlattices have been made by PLD. In this article, an overview of preparation, characterization and properties of epitaxial oxide films and their applications are presented. Future prospects of the method for fabricating epitaxial films of transition metal nitrides, chalcogenides, carbides and borides are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>One of the fascinating fields of study in magnetism in recent years has been the study of quantum phenomena in nanosystems. While semiconductor structures have provided paradigms of nanosystems from the stand point of electronic phenomena,  the synthesis of high nuclearity transition metal complexes have provided examples of nano magnets. The range and diversity of the properties exhibited by these systems rivals its electronic counterparts. Qualitative understanding of these phenomena requires only a knowledge of basic physics, but quantitative study throws up many challenges that are similar to those encountered in the study of correlated electronic systems. In this article, a brief overview of the current trends in this area are highlighted and some of the efforts of our group in developing a quantitative understanding of this field are outlined.</p>

					<p>In this mini-review, I discuss some recent work on the stereochemistry and bonding of lone pairs of electrons in divalent compounds of the heavier carbon group elements  (Sn<sup>II</sup>, Pb<sup>II</sup>) and in trivalent compounds of the heavier nitrogen group elements (Bi<sup>III</sup>). Recently developed methods that permit the real-space visualization of bonding patterns on the basis of density functional calculations of electronic  structure, reveal details of the nature of selectron lone pairs in compounds of the heavier main group elements - their stereochemistry and their inertness (or lack thereof). An examination of  tetragonal $P4/nmm$ SnO, ùõº-PbO  and BiOF, and cubic  $Fm3m$ PbS provides a segue into perovskite phases of technological significance, including ferroelectric PbTiO<sub>3</sub> and antiferroelectric/piezoelectric PbZrO<sub>3</sub>, in both of which the lone  pairs on Pb atoms play a pivotal r√¥le.</p>

				<title>Hydrocarbon chain conformation in an intercalated surfactant monolayer and bilayer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0539-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cetyl trimethyl ammonium (CTA) ions have been confined within galleries of layered CdPS<sub>3</sub> at two different grafting densities. Low grafting densities are obtained on direct intercalation of CTA ions into CdPS<sub>3</sub> to give Cd<sub>0.93</sub>PS<sub>3</sub>(CTA)<sub>0.14</sub>. Intercalation occurs with a lattice expansion of 4.8 √Ö with the interlamellar surfactant ion lying flat forming a monolayer. Intercalation at higher grafting densities was effected by a two-step ion-exchange process to give Cd<sub>0.83</sub>PS<sub>3</sub>(CTA)<sub>0.34</sub>, with a lattice expansion of 26.5 √Ö. At higher grafting densities the interlamellar surfactant ions adopt a tilted bilayer structure. <sup>13</sup>C NMR and orientation-dependent IR vibrational spectroscopy on single crystals have been used to probe the conformation and orientation of the methylene ‚Äòtail‚Äô of the intercalated surfactant in the two phases. In the monolayer phase, the confined methylene chain adopts an essentially all-trans conformation with most of the trans chain aligned parallel to the gallery walls. On lowering the temperature, molecular plane aligns parallel, so that the methylene chain lies flat, rigid and aligned to the confining surface. In the bilayer phase, most bonds in the methylene chain are in trans conformation. It is possible to identify specific conformational sequences containing a gauche bond, in the interior and termini of the intercalated methylene. These high energy conformers disappear on cooling leaving all fifteen methylene units of the intercalated cetyl trimethyl ammonium ion in trans conformational registry at 40 K.</p>

				<title>Diffusion of hydrocarbons in confined media: Translational and rotational motion</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0559-0577</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diffusion of monatomic guest species within confined media has been understood to a good degree due to investigations carried out during the past decade and a half. Most guest species that are of industrial relevance are actually polyatomics such as, for example, hydrocarbons in zeolites. We attempt to investigate the influence of non-spherical nature of guest species on diffusion. Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of motion of methane in NaCaA and NaY, benzene in NaY and one-dimensional channels AlPO<sub>4</sub>-5, VPI-5 and carbon nanotube indicate interesting insights into the influence of the host on rotational degrees of freedom and rientational properties. It is shown that benzene in one-dimensional channels where the levitation parameter is near unity exhibits translational motion opposite to what is expected on the basis of molecular anisotropy. Rotational motion of benzene also possesses rotational diffusivities around C<sub>6</sub> and $C_2$ axes opposite to what is expected on the basis of molecular geometry. Methane shows orientational preference for 2 + 2 or 1 + 3 depending on the magnitude of the levitation parameter.</p>

				<title>Computer simulation study of water using a fluctuating charge model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0579-0590</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen bonding in small water clusters is studied through computer simulation methods using a sophisticated, empirical model of interaction developed by Rick <i>et al</i> (S W Rick, S J Stuart and B J Berne 1994 <i>J. Chem. Phys.</i> <b>101</b> 6141) and others. The model allows for the charges on the interacting sites to fluctuate as a function of time, depending on their local environment. The charge flow is driven by the difference in the electronegativity of the atoms within the water molecule, thus effectively mimicking the effects of polarization of the charge density. The potential model is thus transferable across all phases of water. Using this model, we have obtained the minimum energy structures of water clusters up to a size of ten. The cluster structures agree well with experimental data. In addition, we are able to distinctly identify the hydrogens that form hydrogen bonds based on their charges alone, a feature that is not possible in simulations using fixed charge models. We have also studied the structure of liquid water at ambient conditions using this fluctuating charge model.</p>

				<title>Effects of hydrogen-bond environment on single particle and pair dynamics in liquid water</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0591-0601</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water at 298 and 258 K to investigate the effects of hydrogen-bond environment on various single-particle and pair dynamical properties of water molecules at ambient and supercooled conditions. The water molecules are modelled by the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model. We first calculate the distribution of hydrogen-bond environment in liquid water at both temperatures and then investigate how the selfdiffusion and orientational relaxation of a single water molecule and also the relative diffusion and relaxation of the hydrogen-bond of a water pair depend on the nature of the hydrogen-bond environment of the tagged molecules. We find that the various dynamical quantities depend significantly on the hydrogen-bond environment, especially at the supercooled temperature. The present study provides a molecular-level insight into the dynamics of liquid water under ambient and supercooled conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>MgNb$_{2-x}$Ta$_x$O<sub>6</sub> ($0 &#8804; x &#8804; 2$) phases can be obtained as the major phase (75 to 90&#37;) by solid state reactions starting from oxides. These oxides crystallize in the orthorhombic columbite structure till ùë• = 1.75 and the tetragonal trirutile structure for MgTa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (ùë• = 2.0). For all the compositions there exist secondary phases like Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> or Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in addition to the major AB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> phase. Sintered disks (1200&#176;C) show dielectric constants varying between 14.8 and 16.0 for the entire range of composition at a frequency of 500 kHz. The dielectric loss is nearly constant around 0.025 to 0.03 between 0 &#8804; ùë• &#8804; 1 but increases to 0.17 for the MgTa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> phase (ùë• = 2.0). Scanning electron micrographs reveal a gradual decrease in grain size with increase in Ta concentration with a size of 3 micron for the ùë• = 0 composition (sintered at 1200&#176;C) while the ùë• = 2 phase shows a grain size of approximately 0.5 microns. The microwave dielectric constant at ‚àº14 GHz is found to be 20.9 for the ùë• = 0 composition and 17.7 for the ùë• = 2 composition.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Alkylthiolates of palladium forming a homologous series (butyl to octadecyl) have been prepared and characterized using X-ray diffraction and STM. The thiolates adopt an unusual bilayered lamellar structure, whose thickness is governed by the length of the alkyl chain. These mesophases melt in the temperature range, 60&#176; to 100&#176;C, with the melting point increasing linearly with the thiol chain length. There is evidence to suggest that the alkyl chains are orientationally disordered especially prior to melting.</p>

				<page>0633-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molybdenum disilicide is a high temperature structural ceramic with many attractive properties for engineering applications. Foremost amongst these is its stability in corrosive atmospheres up to about 1600&#176;C. However, there are a few undesirable properties that need to be addressed before it can become a viable material in high temperature applications. Since MoSi<sub>2</sub> forms thermodynamically stable composites with both metals and ceramics, many reinforcing materials are incorporated into the matrix to improve the fracture toughness and creep properties. The low temperature oxidation can be controlled by making high density (&#62; 95&#37; of theoretical density) compacts. This article summarizes the important attempts that are made in improving the properties of molybdenum disilicide-based ceramics by the reinforcement with other materials.</p>

				<title>Applications of self-assembled monolayers in materials chemistry</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0659-0670</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Self-assembly provides a simple route to organise suitable organic molecules on noble metal and selected nanocluster surfaces by using monolayers of long chain organic molecules with various functionalities like -SH, -COOH, -NH<sub>2</sub>, silanes etc. These surfaces can be effectively used to build-up interesting nano level architectures. Flexibility with respect to the terminal functionalities of the organic molecules allows the control of the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of metal surface, while the selection of length scale can be used to tune the distant-dependent electron transfer behaviour. Organo-inorganic materials tailored in this fashion are extremely important in nanotechnology to construct nanoelctronic devices, sensor arrays, supercapacitors, catalysts, rechargeable power sources etc. by virtue of their size and shape-dependent electrical, optical or magnetic properties. The interesting applications of monolayers and monolayer-protected clusters in materials chemistry are discussed using recent examples of size and shape control of the properties of several metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles. The potential benefits of using these nanostructured systems for molecular electronic components are illustrated using Au and Ag nanoclusters with suitable bifunctional SAMs.</p>

				<page>0001-0010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibria of the axial ligation of benzyl(aquo)cobaloximes by imidazole, 1-methyl imidazole, histidine, histamine, glycine, ethyl glycine ester, thiourea and urea have been spectrophotometrically measured in aqueous solutions of ionic strength 1.0 M (KCl) at 25&#176;C as a function of ùëùH. The equilibrium constants are in the order CN$^- &#62;$ 1-methyl imidazole &#62; imidazole &#62; histidine &#62; histamine &#62; glycine &#62; ethyl glycine ester &#62; thiourea &#62; urea. The order of stability of benzyl(ligand)cobaloxime is explained based on the basicity of the ligand, Co(III) $\rightarrow L d\pi-p\pi$ back bonding and soft-soft and soft-hard interaction. Imidazole, substituted imidazoles, histidine and histamine form more stable complexes than glycine, ethyl glycine ester in contrast to the basicity of the ligands. Benzyl(ligand)cobaloximes were isolated and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra.</p>

					<p>Equilibria and kinetics of the reaction of bromomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime with histamine, histidine, glycine and ethyl glycine ester and iodomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime with cyanide, imidazole and substituted imidazoles were studied as a function of ùëùH at 25&#176;C, 1.0 M ionic strength (KCl) by spectrophotometry technique. The rate of substitution of H<sub>2</sub>O varies with the $pKa$ of the incoming ligand, thus establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. Dissociation kinetic reactions were also studied as a function of ùëùH. Binding and kinetic data were interpreted based on the basicity, steric crowd of the entering ligand and HSAB principle. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands ùëùH independent second-order rate constants were calculated.</p>

				<title>Dipicolinate complexes of main group metals with hydrazinium cation</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Some new coordination complexes of hydrazinium main group metal dipicolinate hydrates of formulae (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)2M(dip)<sub>2</sub>.ùëõH<sub>2</sub>O (where, M =Ca, Sr, Ba or Pb and ùëõ = 0, 2, 4 and 3 respectively and dip = dipicolinate), N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Bi(dip)<sub>2</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O and (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Bi(dip)<sub>3</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O have been prepared and characterized by physico-chemical techniques. The infrared spectra of the complexes reveal the presence of tridentate dipicolinate dianions and non-coordinating hydrazinium cations. Conductance measurements show that the mono, di and trihydrazinium complexes behave as 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 electrolytes respectively, in aqueous solution. Thermal decomposition studies show that these compounds lose water followed by endothermic decomposition of hydrazine to give respective metal hydrogendipicolinate intermediates, which further decompose exothermically to the final product of either metal carbonates (Ca, Sr, Ba and Pb) or metal oxycarbonates (Bi). The coordination numbers around the metal ions differ from compound to compound. The various coordination numbers exhibited by these metals are six (Ca), seven (Ba), eight (Sr) and nine (Pb and Bi). In all the complexes the above coordination number is attained by tridentate dipicolinate dianions and water molecules. The X-ray diffraction patterns of these compounds differ from one another suggesting that they are not isomorphous.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The title cations were produced in aqueous solution by chemical initiation (solvolysis) of benzyl-<i>gem</i>-dihalides and benzyl-<i>gem</i>-diazides. The solvolysis reactions of benzyl-<i>gem</i>-dihalides and benzyl-<i>gem</i>-diazides in water proceed by a stepwise mechanism through ùõº-halobenzyl carbocation and ùõº-azidobenzyl carbocation intermediates, which are captured by water to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds as the sole detectable products. Rate constant ratio $k_x/k_s$(M<sup>-1</sup>) for partitioning of the carbocation between reaction with halide/azide ion and reaction with water is determined by analysis of halide/azide common ion inhibition of the solvolysis reaction. The rate constants $k_s$(s<sup>-1</sup>) for the reaction of the cation with solvent water were determined from the experimental values of $k_x/k_s$ and $k_{\text{solv}}$, for the solvolysis of the benzyl-<i>gem</i>-dihalides and benzyl-<i>gem</i>-diazides respectively, using $k_x = 5 \times 10^9$ M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for diffusion-limited reaction of halide/azide ion with ùõº-substituted benzyl carbocations. The values of $1/k_s$ are thus the lifetimes of the ùõº-halobenzyl carbocations and ùõº-azidobenzyl carbocations respectively.</p>

The order of reactivity of different substituted benzothiazoles has been found to be -H &#62; NO<sub>2</sub> &#62; Cl.

				<title>Partitioning of methyl internal rotational barrier energy of thioacetaldehyde</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0061-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nature of methyl internal rotational barrier in thioacetaldehyde has been investigated by relaxation effect, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and Pauling exchange interactions. The true experimental barrier can be obtained by considering fully relaxed rotation. Nuclear-electron attraction term is a barrier forming term in the fully relaxed rotation, but it appears as an antibarrier for rigid rotation. It is seen that during methyl rotation, the torsional mode is coupled with the aldehydic hydrogen out-of-plane wagging motion. Natural bond orbital analysis shows that the principal barrier forming term originates from the C-C bond. The lengthening of the C-C bond is explained by considering charge transfer interaction between several bonding and antibonding orbitals in the C-C bond region, which leads to higher bonding overlap for the eclipsed conformer compared to the staggered conformer. S-C(ùúé)/C<sub>me</sub>-H<sub>ip</sub> and C-H<sub>ald</sub>/C$_{\text{me}}-H<sub>op</sub> interactions appear to be the main barrier-forming Pauling exchange terms but have less contribution to make to the barrier compared to the C-C bond interaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoisomerization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in a polymer-surfactant aggregate is studied using picosecond time resolved emission spectroscopy. The aggregate consists of the polymer, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and the surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). With increase in the concentration of SDS in an aqueous solution of MC540 containing PVP, the emission quantum yield and lifetime of MC540 increase markedly. This indicates marked retardation in the nonradiative photoisomerization process of MC540, when it binds to the polymersurfactant aggregate. The critical association concentration of SDS for binding to PVP has been found to be 0.5 mM. This is about 16 times lower than the CMC of SDS in pure water (8 mM).</p>

				<title>Kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of organic sulphides by 2,2'-bipyridinium chlorochromate</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0137-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of 34 organic sulphides by 2,2'-bipyridinium chlorochromate (BPCC) resulted in the formation of the corresponding sulphoxides. The reaction is first order with respect to both BPCC and the sulphide, and is catalysed by hydrogen ions. The hydrogen-ion dependence has the form: ùëò<sub>obs</sub> = a+b [H<sup>+</sup>]. The oxidation was studied in 19 different organic solvents. An analysis of the solvent effect by Swain‚Äôs equation showed that the both cation- and anion-solvating powers of the solvents play important roles. The rates of oxidation meta- and ùëù-substituted phenyl methyl sulphides were correlated with Charton‚Äôs LDR equation. The rates of the ùëú-compounds showed excellent correlation with the LDRS equation. Oxidation of the ùëù-compounds is more susceptible to the delocalization effect. Oxidation of the ùëö-compounds exhibited a greater dependence on the field effect. In the oxidation of the ùëú-compounds, the contribution of delocalized effect is slightly more than that of the field effect. The oxidation of alkyl phenyl sulphides is subject to both polar and steric effects of the alkyl groups. Polar reaction constants are negative, indicating an electron-deficient sulphur centre in the rate-determining step. A mechanism involving formation of a sulphurane intermediate in the slow step has been proposed.</p>

				<title>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of dimethyl sulphoxide by sodium bromate-sodium bisulphite reagent in aqueous medium</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0149-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rates of oxidation of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) by HOBr produced in situ from sodium bromate-sodium bisulphite reagent have been studied iodometrically in aqueous medium. The order in [DMSO] is one when [DMSO] &#60; 0.01 mol dm<sup>-3</sup>, fractional when [DMSO] is between 0.01 and 0.5 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> and zero when (DMSO) &#60; 0.5 mol dm<sup>-3</sup>. Different rate laws are operative under these three conditions though HOBr is the effective oxidizing species in all the cases. A mechanism involving an intermediate four-membered cyclic transition state between DMSO and HOBr (formation constant ùêæ), which decomposes in a slow step with a rate constant (ùëò) has been proposed. Thermodynamic parameters for the adduct formation step and activation parameters for the first-order decomposition of the adduct step have been evaluated in the temperature range 308-323 K. Activation parameters have also been determined while the orders in [DMSO] are unity and zero. The reaction product has been identified as dimethyl sulphone (DMSO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

				<title>Effects of preparation temperature on the conductivity of polypyrrole conducting polymer</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0155-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made to investigate the effect of temperature on the conductivity of polypyrrole conducting polymer films prepared by an electrochemical method in an aqueous medium using camphor sulfonate as the dopant. The polymer was grown from aqueous solutions employing a range of temperatures (1-60&#176;C). It was found that with increase in temperature the conductivity decreased and the optimum temperature was found to be between 10 and 30&#176;C. The results show that the polymer formed at low temperature has higher conductivity and is stronger than that formed at higher temperatures. Characterization by X-ray scattering shows that interlayer distance, $d_{\text{Bragg}}$ (&#197;), increases with increasing temperature. The morphology of the films formed was studied by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The changes in conductivity and physical appearance were interpreted as being due to compactness in the molecular packing and formation of ùõº ùõΩ linkages in the film.</p>

				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0203-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The alkylation of ethylbenzene with ùë°-butyl alcohol was studied over Al-MCM-41 (Si/Al = 50 and 90) and Al, Mg-MCM-41 (Si/(Al + Mg) =50) in the vapour phase from 200 to 400&#176;C. The products were ùëù-ùë°-butylethylbenzene (ùëù-ùë°-BEB), ùëù-ùë°-butylvinylbenzene (ùëù-ùë°-BVB) and ùëö-ùë°-butylethylbenzene ( ùëö-ùë°-BEB). Ethylbenzene conversion decreased with increase in temperature and increase in the ethylbenzene content of the feed. The reaction between the freely diffusing ethylbenzene in the channel and the ùë°-butyl cations remaining as charge compensating ions yielded ùëù-ùë°-BEB. ùëù-ùë°-BVB, an unexpected product in this investigation, was produced by dehydrogenation of ùëù-ùë°-BEB over alumina particles present in the channels of the molecular sieves. Adsorption of ethylbenzene on Br√∏nsted acid sites and its subsequent reaction with very closely adsorbed ùë°-butyl cations proved to be necessary to obtain  ùëö-ùë°-BEB. Though  ùëö-ùë°-BEB was obtained, the corresponding  ùëö-ùë°-butylvinylbenzene was not observed in this study. Study of time durations indicated rapid and slow catalyst deactivation at lower and higher streams respectively.</p>

					<p>$Ab$ <i>initio</i> and density functional calculations have been performed on the different possible structures of selenourea ($su$), urea ($u$) and thiourea ($tu$) to understand the extent of delocalisation in selenourea in comparison to urea and thiourea. Selenourea ($su-1$) with $C_2$ symmetry has the minima on the potential energy surface at MP2(fu)/$6-31+G^\ast$ level. The C-N rotational barrier in selenourea is 8.69 kcal/mol, which is 0.29 and 0.11 kcal/mol more than that of urea and thiourea respectively at MP2(fu)/$6-31+G^\ast$ level. N-inversion barrier is 0.55 kcal/mol at MP2(fu)$6-31+G^\ast$ level. NBO analysis has been carried out to understand the nature of different interactions responsible for the electron delocalisation.</p>

					<p>The diphosphazane ligands of the type, (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)PN(R)P(E)Y<sub>2</sub> (R = CHMe<sub>2</sub> or (ùëÜ)-<sup>&#8727;</sup>CHMePh; E = lone pair or S; Y<sub>2</sub> = O<sub>2</sub>C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>12</sub> or Y = OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> or OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Me-4 or OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OMe-4 or OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Bu$^t$-4 or C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) bearing axially chiral 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dioxy moiety have been synthesised. The structure and absolute configuration of a diastereomeric palladium complex, [PdCl<sub>2</sub>{$\eta^2$-((O<sub>2</sub>C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>12</sub>)PN((ùëÜ)-<sup>&#8727;</sup>CHMePh)PPh<sub>2</sub>}] has been determined by X-ray crystallography.

				<title>Bending crystals. Solid state photomechanical properties of transition metal complexes containing semiquinonate ligands</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0247-0254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The properties of transition metal complexes containing catecholate and radical semiquinonate ligands have often been found to be unusual and unexpected. Crystals of Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>(3,6-DBSQ), containing the 3,6-di-<i>tert</i>-butyl-1,2-semiquinonate ligand, form as long thin needles that are observed to bend reversibly upon irradiation with NIR light. Crystallographic characterization reveals a stacked solid state lattice with planar molecules aligned with metal atoms atop one another. Electronic spectra recorded in the solid state and in solution show an intense band at 1600 nm that maps the energy dependence of crystal bend angle. The transition is a property of the stacked assembly, rather than of an individual complex molecule, and appears associated with an MLCT process that transfers charge from an antibonding band formed by interacting Rh $d_z^2$ orbitals to the vacant quinone $\pi^\ast$ orbital. Related observations have been made on the [Co(ùúá-pyz)(3,6-DBSQ)(3,6-DBCat)]$_n$ polymer. Photomechanical properties appear associated with electronic transitions that lead to a physical change in axial length of a linear polymer, coupled with a soft solid state lattice that permits axial contraction/expansion without crystal fracture.</p>

					<p>Salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (H2saltsc) reacts with [M(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>X<sub>2</sub>] (M = Ru, Os; X = Cl, Br) to afford complexes of type [M(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Hsaltsc)<sub>2</sub>], in which the salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone ligand is coordinated to the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a four-membered chelate ring. Reaction of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones (Hbztsc-R) with [M(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>X<sub>2</sub>] also affords complexes of similar type, viz. [M(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(bztsc-R)<sub>2</sub>], in which the benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazones have also been found to coordinate the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a fourmembered chelate ring as before. Reaction of the Hbztsc-R ligands has also been carried out with [M(bpy)<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>] (M = Ru, Os; X = Cl, Br), which has afforded complexes of type [M(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(bztsc-R)]<sup>+</sup>, which have been isolated as perchlorate salts. Coordination mode of bztsc-R has been found to be the same as before. Structure of the Hbztsc-OMe ligand has been determined and some molecular modelling studies have been carried out determine the reason for the observed mode of coordination. Reaction of acetone thiosemicarbazone (Hactsc) has then been carried out with [M(bpy)<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>] to afford the [M(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(actsc)]ClO<sub>4</sub> complexes, in which the actsc ligand coordinates the metal as a bidentate N,S-donor forming a five-membered chelate ring. Reaction of H<sub>2</sub>saltsc has been carried out with [Ru(bpy)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] to prepare the [Ru(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(Hsaltsc)]ClO<sub>4</sub> complex, which has then been reacted with one equivalent of nickel perchlorate to afford an octanuclear complex of type [{Ru(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(saltsc-H)$\}_4$Ni<sub>4</sub>](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.</p>

				<title>Ruthenium, osmium and rhodium complexes of polypyridyl ligands: Metal-promoted activities, stereochemical aspects and electrochemical properties</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0269-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article presents a brief overview of the reactions of 2,4,6-<i>tris</i>(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tptz) in presence of rhodium(III), ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) under various experimental conditions. Under certain experimental conditions tptz exhibits metal-assisted hydrolysis/hydroxylation at the triazine ring. However, synthetic methods have also been developed to prepare complexes with intact tptz. Molecular structures of some of the complexes, especially stereoisomers of the hydroxylated products, are established by single crystal X-ray studies. A critical analysis of all data suggests that the electron-withdrawing effect of the metal ion (L‚ÜíM ùúédonation) is the predominant factor, rather than angular strain, that is responsible for metal-promoted reactivities. Electrochemical properties of all of these complexes have been investigated, Rh(III) complexes are excellent catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>, and dinuclear Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes exhibit strong electronic communication between the metal centres.</p>

				<title>Innocent or guilty? Redox activity in and magnetic and optical behaviour of dinuclear molydenum complexes</title>

				<page>0291-0309</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phenomenon of `non-innocence‚Äô, first articulated by J√∏rgensen in 1966, is briefly reviewed. Spectroelectrochemical studies of a range of dinuclear complexes of the type [{Mo(NO)Tp<sup>&#8727;</sup>Cl}<sub>2</sub>(bridge)] (bridge = dipyridyls) and [{Mo(O)Tp<sup>&#8727;</sup>Cl}<sub>2</sub>(bridge)] (bridge = diphenolates) which are redox active, show that oxidised or reduced forms of these species exhibit `non-innocence‚Äô. The spectral behaviour is associated with metal-to-ligand or ligand-to-metal charge transfer phenomena, probably the first time that monodentate bridging ligands have been implicated in `non-innocent‚Äô behaviour. These bridging ligands also determine the nature and extent of magnetic interaction between the unpaired spins in [{Mo(NO)Tp<sup>&#8727;</sup>Cl}<sub>2</sub>(bridge)] and [{Mo(O)Tp<sup>&#8727;</sup>Cl}<sub>2</sub>(bridge)], the dominant mechanism of spin-exchange relying on the extent of $\eth$-delocalisation within the bridging ligands. The unusual optical behaviour of these dinuclear complexes when oxidised (oxomolybdenum diphenolates) or reduced (nitrosyl molybdenum dipyridyls) has led to the exploration of electrochromism as a means to develop variable optical attenuators operating in the near-infrared region.</p>

				<title>Inverted porphyrins and expanded porphyrins: An overview</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0311-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Porphyrins and metallopophyrins have attracted the attention of chemists for the past 100 years or more owing to their widespread involvement in biology. More recently, synthetic porphyrins and porphyrin-like macrocycles have attracted the attention of researchers due to their diverse applications as sensitizers for photodynamic therapy, MRI contrasting agents, and complexing agents for larger metal ions and also for their anion binding abilities. The number of ùúã-electrons in the porphyrin ring can be increased either by increasing the number of conjugated double bonds between the pyrrole rings or by increasing the number of heterocyclic rings. Thus, 22ùúã sapphyrins, 26ùúã rubyrins, 30ùúã heptaphyrins, 34ùúã octaphyrins and higher cyclic polypyrrole analogues containing 40ùúã, 48ùúã, 64ùúã, 80ùúã and 96ùúã systems have recently been reported in the literature. These macrocycles show rich structural diversity where normal and different kinds of inverted structures have been identified. In this review, an attempt has been made to collect the literature of the inverted porphyrins and expanded porphyrins reported until December 2001. Since the <i>meso</i> aryl expanded porphyrins have tendency to form both inverted and non-inverted structures more emphasis has been given to <i>meso</i> aryl expanded porphyrins.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This presentation reports some novel examples of organic ring amination reactions via metal mediation. The organic transformations are highly regioselective and can be controlled by the proper selection of the mediator complex. The two isomeric organic ligands viz. HL<sup>1</sup> and HL<sup>2</sup> were isolated in their pure states by the removal of the metal ions. These were fully characterized. The ligand HL<sup>1</sup> has low $pKa$, 8.5. Upon deprotonation, it behaves as a potential <i>bis</i> chelating N,N,N-donors. The coordination chemistry of the HL<sup>1</sup> ligand involving some 3ùëë-metal ions is described. Two unusual low-spin complexes of manganese(II) and iron(III) are reported. The ferric complex displayed a rhombic EPR while, the corresponding manganese compound showed a complex pattern due to hyperfine coupling. All the complexes displayed large number of redox responses. A brief mention about the future projection of this work is noted.</p>

				<title>Is copper(I) really soft? Probing the hardness of Cu(I) with pyridinecarboxaldehyde ligands</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cu(I) complexes of formula Cu(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>LClO<sub>4</sub> [L = 2 or 3 pyridine carboxaldehyde] are synthesised and characterised to explore the coordination of an aldehyde, a hard and neutral oxygen donor to a soft Cu(I) centre. The structural and spectroscopic results illustrate that only in 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, the `C=O' group coordinates to soft Cu(I) centres due to a favourable chelate effect, while in 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, it remains uncoordinated. Upon chelation via N and O donors, 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde resembles bipyridine or phenanthroline in terms of its bite angle and spectroscopic features. Such chelation can be easily challenged with coordinating anions like bromide, or more basic pyridines. A drastic change in the MLCT absorption signals the decomplexation of the `C=O‚Äô group. The observed results point out that the Cu(I) centre can readily exchange the hard `O‚Äô donor for softer ligands.</p>

				<title>Organotellurium ligands - designing and complexation reactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0357-0366</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A variety of tellurium ligands has been designed and studied for their complexation reactions in the last decade. Of these hybrid telluroethers, halotellurium ligands and polytellurides are the most notable ones. RTe<sup>-</sup> and polytelluride ions have also been used to design clusters. Ligation of ditelluroethers and several hybrid telluroethers is extensively studied in our laboratories. The ditelluroether ligand RTeCH<sub>2</sub>TeR (where R = 4-MeOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) (<b>1</b>), similar to dppm [1,2-<i>bis</i>(diphenylphosphino) methane], has been synthesized in good yield (‚àº80 &#37;) by reacting CHCl<sub>3</sub> with RTe<sup>-</sup> (generated in situ by borohydride reduction of R<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>). Iodine reacts with <b>1</b> to give tetra-iodo derivative, which has intermolecular Te$\cdots$I interactions resulting in a macro structure containing rectangular Te-I$\cdots$Te bridges. <b>1</b> readily forms four membered rings with Pd(II) and Ru(II). On the formation of this chelate ring, the signal in <sup>125</sup>Te NMR spectra shifts significantly upfield (50-60 ppm). The bridging mode of <b>1</b> has been shown in [Ru(ùëù-cymene)Cl<sub>2</sub>](ùúá-<b>1</b>)[Ru(ùëù-cymene)Cl<sub>2</sub>]. The hybrid telluroether ligands explored are of the types (Te$_x$, S$_y$), (Te$_x$, N$_y$) and (Te$_x$, O$_y$). The tellurium donor site has strong <i>trans</i> influence, which is manifested more strongly in square planar complexes of palladium(II). The morpholine N-donor site has been found to have weaker donor characteristics in (Te$_x$, N$_y$) ligands than pyridine and alkylamine donor sites of analogous ligands. The singlet oxygen readily oxidises the coordinated Te. This oxidation follows first order kinetics. The complexation reaction of RuCl<sub>3</sub>.ùë•H<sub>2</sub>O with N-[2-(4-methoxyphenyltelluro)ethyl]phthalimide (<b>2</b>) results in a novel (Te, N, O)-heterocycle, Te-chloro,Te-anisyl-1a-aza-4-oxa-3-tellura-1H, 2H, 4aH-9 fluorenone. The (Te, O) ligands can be used as hemilabile ligands, the oxygen atom temporarily protects the vacant coordination site before the arrival of the substrate. The chelate shifts observed in <sup>125</sup>Te NMR spectra of metal complexes of Te-ligands have a close parallel to those of <sup>31</sup>P NMR. For the formation of fivemembered rings, the value is positive and of the order of 130 ppm whereas for sixmembered rings it is negative and ‚àº30 ppm only.</p>

				<title>Novel vanadium phosphate phases as catalysts for selective oxidation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0379-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In our effort to induce novel modifications in the structure of some important vanadium phosphate phases used as selective oxidation catalysts, it has been observed that metal ions such as Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Pd<sup>2+</sup> can be incorporated into the vanadyl hydrogen phosphate VOHPO<sub>4</sub>$\cdot$0.5H<sub>2</sub>O phase in very different ways depending upon the medium of preparation. It has been found that the metal ions are either substituted into the lattice with retention of structure of the parent compound or intercalated between the layers of a new mixed-valent phase. These new metalincorporated phases are catalytically active and the palladium incorporated compound in particular displays shape selective catalysis for different oxidation and reduction reactions. In another approach, the preparation of VOHPO<sub>4</sub>$\cdot$0.5H<sub>2</sub>O has been modified to give a novel crystalline phase containing mixed-valent vanadium and having NH<sub>3</sub> species bound to the lattice. This phase could be a potential catalyst for ammoxidation reactions. In addition, novel mesostructured vanadium phosphate phases have been prepared using a long-chain amine as the templating agent involving a ligand templating mechanism of formation.</p>

The dpq complexes are efficient DNA binding and cleavage active species. The dppz complexes show good binding ability but poor nuclease activity. The cleavage activity of the <i>bis</i>-dpq complex is significantly higher than the <i>bis</i>-phen complex of copper(II). The nuclease activity is found to be dependent on the intercalating nature of the complex and on the redox potential of the copper(II)/copper(I) couple.

				<abstract>
					<p>The hexafluorophosphate and chloride salts of two ruthenium(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(phen)(ptzo)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [Ru(ptzo)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, where ptzo = 1,10-phenanthrolino[5,6-ùëí]1,2,4-triazine-3-one (ptzo) - a new modified phenanthroline (phen) ligand, have been synthesised. These complexes have been characterised by infrared, UV-Vis, steady-state emission and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopic methods. Results of absorption and fluorescence titration as well as thermal denaturation studies reveal that both the <i>bis</i>- and <i>tris</i>-complexes of ptzo show moderately strong affinity for binding with calf thymus (CT) DNA with the binding constants being close to 10<sup>5</sup>M<sup>-1</sup> in each case. An intercalative mode of DNA binding has been suggested for both the complexes. Emission studies carried out in non-aqueous solvents and in aqueous media without DNA reveal that both [Ru(phen)(ptzo)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [Ru(ptzo)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> are weakly luminescent under these solution conditions. Successive addition of CT DNA to buffered aqueous solutions containing [Ru(phen)(ptzo)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> results in an enhancement of the emission. These results have been discussed in the light of the dependence of the structure-specific deactivation processes of the MLCT state of the metallointercalator with the characteristic features of its DNA interaction. In doing so, attempts have been made to compare and contrast its properties with those of the analogous phenanthroline-based complexes including the ones reported by us previously.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0417-0430</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coordination chemistry of copper(II) with tridentate aroylhydrazones is briefly discussed in this article. Two types of aroylhydrazones derived from aroylhydrazines and ortho-hydroxy aldehydes or 2-pyridine-carboxaldehyde have been used. The characterization of the complexes has been performed with the help of various physico-chemical techniques. Solid state structural patterns have been established by X-ray crystallography. In the solid state, structural varieties of these complexes are seen to range from monomeric, dimeric, polymeric and onedimensional self-assembly via hydrogen bonds and ùúã-ùúã interactions. EPR spectroscopy and variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements have been used to reveal the nature of the coordination geometry and magnetic characteristics of these complexes.</p>

					<p>Intervalence charge transfer properties were studied for a set of mixed valence complexes incorporating Ru(III) and Fe(II)-centres linked by various saturated and unsaturated bridging ligands (BL). Studies reveal that degree of ground state electronic interaction and coupling between Ru(III) and Fe(II)-centres can be attenuated by changing the nature of the bridging ligand.

				<title>Bridging function mediated intermetallic coupling in diruthenium-<i>bis</i>(bipyridine) complexes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0443-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interactions of potentially dinucleating bridging functionalities (<b>I</b>-<b>VI</b>) with the ruthenium-bis(bypyridine) precursor [Ru<sup>II</sup>(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(EtOH)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> have been explored. The bridging functions <b>I</b>, <b>II</b> and <b>VI</b> directly result in the expected dinuclear complexes of the type [(bpy)<sub>2</sub>Ru<sup>II</sup>{L$^n$}Ru<sup>II</sup>(bpy)<sub>2</sub>]$^{z+}$ (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>) (ùëõ = 0, ùëß = 4 and ùëõ = -2, ùëß = 2). The bridging ligand <b>III</b> undergoes N-N or N-C bond cleavage reaction on coordination to the Ru<sup>II</sup>(bpy)<sub>2</sub> core which eventually yields a mononuclear complex of the type [(bpy)<sub>2</sub>Ru<sup>II</sup>(L)]<sup>+</sup>, <b>3</b>, where L = <sup>-</sup>OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(R)C(R&#8242;)=N-H. However, the electrogenerated mononuclear ruthenium(III) congener, <b>3</b><sup>+</sup> in acetonitrile dimerises to [(bpy)<sub>2</sub>Ru<sup>III</sup> {<sup>-</sup>OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(R)C(R&#8242;)=N-N=(R&#8242;)C(R)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>-</sup>}Ru<sup>III</sup>(bpy)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>4+</sup> (<b>4</b>). In the presence of a slight amount of water content in the acetonitrile solvent the dimeric species (<b>4</b>) reduces back to the starting ruthenium(II) monomer (<b>3</b>). The preformed bridging ligand <b>IV</b> undergoes multiple transformations on coordination to the Ru(bpy)<sub>2</sub> core, such as hydrolysis of the imine groups of <b>IV</b> followed by intermolecular head-to-tail oxidative coupling of the resultant amino phenol moieties, which in turn results in a new class of dimeric complex of the type [(bpy)<sub>2</sub>Ru<sup>II</sup> {<sup>-</sup>OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-N=C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(=NH)O<sup>-</sup>}Ru<sup>II</sup>(bpy)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> (<b>5</b>). In <b>5</b>, the bridging ligand comprises of two ùëÅ,ùëÇ chelating binding sites each formally in the semiquinone level and there is a ùëù-benzoquinonediimine bridge between the metal centres. In complex <b>6</b>, the preformed bridging ligand, 3,6-<i>bis</i>(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2-dihydro-1,2,4,5- tetrazine, H<sub>2</sub>L (<b>V</b>) undergoes oxidative dehydrogenation to aromatic tetrazine based bridging unit, 3,6-<i>bis</i>(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, L. The detailed spectroelectrochemical aspects of the complexes have been studied in order to understand the role of the bridging units towards the intermetallic electronic coupling in the dinuclear complexes.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0451-0460</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Titanium (IV) phosphates TCM-7 and -8 with mesoporous cationic framework topologies using both cationic and anionic surfactants have been synthesized. Experimental data suggest the stabilization of the tetrahedral state of Ti in TCM-7/8 (O-P-O-Ti-O-, at Ti/P = 1:1) <i>vis-√†-vis</i> the most stable octahedral state of Ti in the rutile/anatase or pure mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>. Mesoporous TCM-7 and -8 show anion exchange capacity due to the framework phosphonium cation and cation exchange capacity due to defective P-OH groups. Grafting the organic functionality in the surface or bridging the organic moiety in between the inorganic phosphorus precursors can enhance hydrophobicity of these materials similar to that of mesoporous silica materials. The high catalytic activity in the liquid phase partial oxidation of cyclohexene over such organically surface modified mesoporous titanium phosphate using a dilute H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidant supports the tetrahedral coordination of Ti in these materials. These materials also show excellent photocatalytic activity in the production of H<sub>2</sub> by photo-reduction of water under UV light irradiation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>2D NMR spectroscopy has been used to determine the metal configuration in solution of three complexes, viz. [($\eta^6$-ùëù-cymene)Ru(L<sup>&#8727;</sup>)Cl] (<b>1</b>) and [($\eta^6$-ùëù-cymene)Ru(L<sup>&#8727;</sup>)(L')] (ClO<sub>4</sub>) (L' = H<sub>2</sub>O, <b>2</b>; PPh<sub>3</sub>, <b>3</b>), where L<sup>&#8727;</sup> is the anion of (ùëÜ)-(1-phenylethyl)salicylaldimine. The complexes exist in two diastereomeric forms in solution. Both the (R<sub>Ru</sub>,$S_{\text{C}}$)- and ($S_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$)-diastereomers display the presence of attractive CH/ùúã interaction involving the phenyl group attached to the chiral carbon and the cymene ring hydrogens. This interaction restricts the rotation of the C<sup>&#8727;</sup>-N single bond and, as a result, two structural types with either the hydrogen atom attached to the chiral carbon (C<sup>&#8727;</sup>) or the methyl group attached to C<sup>&#8727;</sup> in close proximity of the cymene ring protons get stabilized. Using 2D NMR spectroscopy as a tool, the spatial interaction involving these protons are studied in order to obtain the metal configuration(s) of the diastereomeric complexes in solution. This technique has enabled us to determine the metal configuration as ($R_{\text{Ru}}$,$S_{\text{C}}$) for the major isomers of <b>1-3</b> in solution.</p>

					<p>Single crystal EPR studies of VO(II)-doped cadmium potassium phosphate hexahydrate (CPPH) have been carried out at room temperature. The angular variation spectra in the three orthogonal planes indicate that the paramagnetic impurity has entered the lattice only substitutionally in place of Cd(II).

Antisymmetric and symmetric carboxylate stretching vibrations have been used to determine the nature of the ODSA/cation complexes.

				<abstract>
					<p>Dynamics of isomerization and fluorescence depolarization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in an aqueous solution of polyacrylic acid (PAA) have been studied using picosecond time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. It is observed that the dynamics of isomerization and depolarization are sensitive enough to monitor the uncoiling of PAA at high ùëùH (&#62; 6). At low ùëùH (&#60; 3), when the polymer remains in a hypercoiled form, polymer bound MC540 experiences very high microscopic friction and, hence, the isomerization and depolarization processes are very slow. At high ùëùH (&#62; 6) a polyanion is formed and the polymer assumes an extended configuration due to electrostatic repulsion. At high ùëùH (&#62; 6), the anionic probe MC540 is expelled from the polyanion to bulk water and the dynamics of isomerization and fluorescence depolarization become faster by 12 and 5 times respectively, compared to those at low ùëùH.</p>

				<page>0513-0520</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Development of reliable protocols for the synthesis of nanoparticles of well-defined sizes and good monodispersity is an important aspect of nanotechnology. In this paper, we present details of the synthesis of gold nanoparticles of good monodispersity by the reduction of aqueous chloroaurate ions by the amino acid, aspartic acid. The colloidal gold solution thus formed is extremely stable in time, indicating electrostatic stabilization via nanoparticle surface-bound amino acid molecules. This observation has been used to modulate the size of the gold nanoparticles in solution by varying the molar ratio of chloroaurate ions to aspartic acid in the reaction medium. Characterization of the aspartic acid-reduced gold nanoparticles was carried out by UV-visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The use of amino acids in the synthesis and stabilization of gold nanoparticle in water has important implications in the development of new protocols for generation of bioconjugate materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoinduced electron transfer from chlorophyll-ùëé through the interface of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) headgroup of the lipid bilayers was studied with electron magnetic resonance (EMR). The photoproduced radicals were identified with electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical yields of chlorophyll-ùëé were determined by double integration ESR spectra. The formation of vesicles was identified by changes in measured $\lambda_{\max}$ values from diethyl ether solutions to vesicles solutions indirectly, and observed directly with SEM and TEM images.

In this paper, we discuss the design strategies for the development of efficient <i>off-on</i> fluorescence signalling systems for the transition metal ions.

				<title>Photophysical properties of 5-hydroxyindole (5HI): Laser flash photolysis study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0547-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Steady state fluorescence emission and transient absorption spectra of 9-fluorenone (9FL) were measured in the presence of 5-hydroxyindole (5HI) in highly polar acetonitrile (ACN) environment at ambient temperature. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrate that ground state 5HI as a donor could take part in highly exothermic electron transfer (ET) reactions with excited 9FL, which should serve as electron acceptor. From the transient absorption measurements it is inferred that in geminate ion-pair (GIP) (or contact ion pair), formed initially due to photoinduced ET, the decay of this contact ion-pair occurs not only through ion recombination (back electron transfer to ground state of reactants), but through the other processes also such as proton-transfer (hydrogen abstraction) from radical cation to anion and separation of ion-pair producing the free ions. From the computed reorganisation energy parameter (ùúÜ) and experimentally observed $- \Delta G^0_{ET}$ values it is hinted that there is a possibility that highly exothermic forward electron transfer reactions in the singlet state $S_1$ occur, within present reacting systems, in Marcus inverted region. Back transfer seems to follow the same path. Investigations with similar other reacting systems are underway.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new family of covalently linked `Sn(IV) porphyrin-anthracene‚Äô diad (<b>1</b>), triad (<b>2</b>) and tetrad (<b>3</b>) donor-acceptor (D-A) systems have been designed and synthesized in good-to-moderate yields. While diad <b>1</b> possesses one anthracene subunit at the peripheral (meso) position of the tin(IV) porphyrin scaffold, triad <b>2</b> possesses two trans axial anthracene subunits at the tin(IV) centre. On the other hand, tetrad <b>3</b> is endowed with both the peripheral and axial anthracene subunits in its architecture. These D-A systems have been fully characterised by elemental analysis, FAB-MS, UV-Vis, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR and electrochemical methods. UV-Vis, NMR and redox data suggest the absence of intramolecular ùúã-ùúã interaction between the porphyrin and the anthracene/s in <b>1-3</b>. Fluorescence from the anthracene subunit in <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> is found to be quenched in comparison with the fluorescence of free anthracene in four different solvents. This is not the case with compound <b>2</b>. Excitation spectral data provides evidence for an intramolecular excitation energy transfer (EET) from the singlet anthracene to the porphyrin in <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>. The energy transfer efficiency is in the order: <b>2</b> (almost negligible) &#60; 3 (‚àº 30&#37;) &#60; <b>1</b> (nearly quantitative), with the peripheral anthracene ‚Üí porphyrin pathway being largely favoured. This orientation dependence of EET could be analysed using Forster‚Äôs dipole dipole mechanism.</p>

				<title>Protein scissors: Photocleavage of proteins at specific locations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0579-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Site-specific photocleavage of hen egg lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by N-(L-phenylalanine)-4(1-pyrene)butyramide (Py-Phe) is investigated in detail with respect to its efficiency, dependence on oxygen, and radical quenchers. Binding of Py-Phe to BSA follows a biphasic process with two binding sites per protein. The photocleavage was achieved upon irradiating a mixture of protein, Py-Phe and Co(III)hexammine (CoHA) at 344 nm. No protein cleavage was observed in the absence of Py-Phe, or CoHA, or light. Photocleavage of BSA was inhibited by degassing or by the addition of radical quenchers such as ethanol. In addition, the photoreaction was quenched by electron donors such as ethanolamine. This result was corroborated by the flash photolysis studies where the cation radical derived from the probe is also quenched by ethanolamine with an equivalent rate constant. Quenching of the singlet excited state of Py-Phe by CoHA followed by the reaction of the resulting pyrenyl cation radical with the protein backbone is the suggested mechanism of protein cleavage. The origin of the specificity of photocleavage is discussed and specificity is valuable in targeting desired sites of proteins with small molecules.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) molecule, ùëù-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoic acid (DMABA) has been studied in zeolite and colloidal media. The ratio of ICT to normal emission (ICT/LE) is greatly enhanced in zeolites compared to that in polar solvents. The ICT emission of DMABA was quenched by increasing the concentration of TiO<sub>2</sub> colloids, while the normal emission was slightly enhanced. Upon illumination of the heteropoly acid (HPA) incorporated TiO<sub>2</sub> colloids, interfacial electron transfer takes place from the conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub> to the incorporated HPA which is also excited to catalyze the photoreduction of Methyl Orange. It is found that the interfacial electron transfer mechanism of HPA/TiO<sub>2</sub> is quite analogous to the Z-scheme mechanism for plant photosynthetic systems. In DMABA-adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub>/Y-zeolite the ICT/LE ratio of DMABA is quite small implying that electron transfer takes place from DMABA to the conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This results in drastic enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of DMABA-adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub>/Y-zeolite compared to free TiO<sub>2</sub>/Y-zeolite.</p>

				<page>0623-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the evolution of views on methyl internal rotation potential barrier. Various mechanisms proposed for the origin of torsional barrier in ethane have been reviewed. Inadequacy of one dimensional description of internal rotation has been highlighted in small methyl conjugated molecules in the light of its multidimensional nature. The effect of skeletal flexing on the picture of barrier formation by dissecting the barrier energy into potential type, virial type and symmetry type is described. The role of ùúå and ùúé electrons at different stages of molecular flexing is discussed. The analysis identifies the dominant contributions to barrier origin as ùúã-bonding changes during rigid rotation and ùúé-bonding changes resulting from bond lengthening during methyl group rotation. The contribution of lone pair electrons in determining the preferred structure of the methyl group in imine compounds such as 1-methyl 2-(1H)-pyridinimine is presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Laser isotope separation (LIS) by infrared laser chemistry of polyatomic molecules has come a long way since its discovery. The last decade has seen considerable efforts in scaling up of the process for light elements like carbon, oxygen and silicon. These efforts aim at ways to improve both the enrichment factor and the throughput. The achievement is quite significant especially for carbon isotope separation wherein macroscopic operating scales have been realized. We report our studies on the IR laser chemistry of two promising systems, viz. neat CF<sub>2</sub>HCl and CF<sub>3</sub>Br/Cl<sub>2</sub>. We have investigated conditions for optimizing the dissociation yield and selectivity using natural samples containing 1.1 &#37; C-13. We also highlight our current efforts for scaling up the process. These include the design aspects of a photochemical reactor with multipass refocusing Herriott optics for efficient photon utilization, development of a cryogenic distillation set up and a preparative gas chromatograph for large scale separation/collection of the isotopically enriched photoproduct in the post-irradiation stage.</p>

				<title>Modelling of multifrequency IRMPD for laser isotope separation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0649-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The process of infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) of molecules is of great fundamental importance and has practical significance, such as isotope separation etc. Unfortunately, a clear insight into the process has been hindered by the bewildering array of important variables affecting MPD. The dissociation probability ùõæ (ùúô) i.e. the yield has been found to be a sensitive function of laser fluence ùúô along with numerous other parameters like laser frequency, gas pressure etc. We have shown that in single frequency IRMPD, an accurate quantitative characterization of the dissociation probability can be adequately expressed by a `power law‚Äô model with two fitting parameters namely critical fluence, $\phi_c$ and multiphoton order, ùëö. This model was exploited in analysing our MPD results on various systems. However, the small isotope shift encountered in heavy elements and the sticking phenomenon observed in small light molecules restrict respectively the separation factor and the dissociation yield. These problems can effectively be tackled by irradiation with multifrequency laser beams which can be chosen appropriately on the basis of spectroscopic features. Based on our success in single frequency model, multifrequency IRMPD is modelled by a functional form containing the product of power law terms for individual fluences on irradiation frequencies. This model is successfully benchmarked with our experimental results on multifrequency LIS of tritium. Such knowledge can be utilized for appropriate separation process design, evaluation and optimization.</p>

				<title>Maximization of yield of C-13 isotope by multiphoton dissociation of Freon-22 using high average power TEA CO<sub>2</sub> laser</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0659-0673</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selective multi-photon dissociation (MPD) of Freon-22 (CF<sub>2</sub>HCl) molecules has been carried out using a TEA CO<sub>2</sub> laser at various CO<sub>2</sub> laser lines (9ùëÉ(20)-9ùëÉ(26)) in order to maximize the yield of C-13 isotope in the product (C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>) at an enrichment factor of 100. The effects of laser pulse tail due to the presence of N<sub>2</sub> in the laser mixture on the enrichment factor and yield of C-13 are investigated. It is found that the addition of a small amount of N<sub>2</sub> is possible in the laser mixture without a significant drop in the yield at desired enrichment factor. Addition of a small amount of N<sub>2</sub> improves the laser efficiency considerably. At a given pulse energy, a slight change in the near field intensity distribution of a laser severely affects the selectivity of C-13 isotope. The computed far-field intensity distributions of the measured near-field intensities show marked spatial variation in the focal spots that leads to a drop in selectivity. For macroscopic production of C-13 isotope a simple and novel multi-pass cavity has been designed and tested to focus the energy repeatedly keeping the optimum fluence constant at each focal spot.</p>

				<title>Absolute quantum yield measurements for the formation of oxygen atoms after UV laser excitation of SO<sub>2</sub> at 222.4 nm</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0675-0686</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dynamics of formation of oxygen atoms after UV photoexcitation of SO<sub>2</sub> in the gas-phase was studied by pulsed laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence `pump-and-probe‚Äô technique in a flow reactor. SO<sub>2</sub> at room-temperature was excited at the KrCl excimer laser wavelength (222.4 nm) and O(<sup>3</sup>P$_j$) photofragments were detected under collision-free conditions by vacuum ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence. The use of narrow-band probe laser radiation, generated via resonant third-order sum-difference frequency conversion of dye laser radiation in Krypton, allowed the measurement of the nascent O(<sup>3</sup>P$_{j=2,1,0}$) fine-structure state distribution: $n_{j=2}/n_{j=1}/n_{j=0}$ = (0.88 \pm 0.02)/(0.10 \pm 0.01)/(0.02 \pm 0.01). Employing NO<sub>2</sub> photolysis as a reference, a value of $\Phi$<sub>O(<sub>3</sub>P)</sub> = 0.13 ¬±  0.05 for the absolute O(<sup>3</sup>P) atom quantum yield was determined. The measured O(<sup>3</sup>P) quantum yield is compared with the results of earlier fluorescence quantum yield measurements. A suitable mechanism is suggested in which the dissociation proceeds via internal conversion from high rotational states of the initially excited SO<sub>2</sub>($\tilde{C}^1$ B<sub>2</sub>) (1, 2, 2) vibronic level to nearby continuum states of the electronic ground state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of 8-methoxypyrimido[4',5':4,5] thieno (2,3-ùëè)quinoline-4(3H)one (MPTQ) with DNA was studied by UV-Vis and fluorescenc'e spectrophotometry as well as by hydrodynamic methods. On binding to DNA, the absorption spectrum underwent bathochromic and hypochromic shifts and the fluorescence was quenched. Binding parameters, determined from spectrophotometric measurements by Scatchard analysis, indicated a binding constant of $3.56 \times 10^6$ M<sup>-1</sup> for calf thymus DNA at ionic strength 0.01 M. Binding to the GC-rich DNA of <i>Micrococcus lysodeikticus</i> was stronger than the binding to calf thymus DNA at ionic strength 0.01 M. The MPTQ increased the viscosity of sonicated rod-like DNA fragments, producing a calculated length of 2.4 √Ö/bound MPTQ molecule. The binding of MPTQ to DNA increased the melting temperature by about 4&#176;C. This research offers a new intercalation functional group to DNA targetted drug design.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Deaerated 5 M NaCl solution is irradiated in the presence of UO<sub>2</sub> pellets with a-radiation from <sup>238</sup>Pu. Experiments are conducted with <sup>238</sup>Pu doped pellets and others with <sup>238</sup>Pu dissolved in the brine. The radiolysis products and yields of mobilized U and Pu from the oxidative dissolution of UO<sub>2</sub> are determined. Results found for radiolysis products and for the oxidation/dissolution of pellets immersed in Pu containing brine are similar to results for Pu doped pellets, where the radiation chemical processes occur only in the liquid layer of some 10 ùúám thickness adjacent to the pellet. The yield of radiolysis products is comparable to earlier results, that of mobilized U from the pellets is &#60; 1&#37; of the total amount of oxidized species. Thus, the radiation chemical yield (ùê∫-value) for mobilized hexavalent U is &#60; 0.01 ions/100 eV. In spite of the low radiation yield for the corrosion, the rate of UO<sub>2</sub> dissolution is higher than expected for the concentrations of long-lived oxidizing radiolysis compounds found in the solutions.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence studies on radiation oxidative damage to membranes with implications to cellular radiosensitivity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0705-0711</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radiation oxidative damage to plasma membrane and its consequences to cellular radiosensitivity have received increasing attention in the past few years. This review gives a brief account of radiation oxidative damage in model and cellular membranes with particular emphasis on results from our laboratory. Fluorescence and ESR spin probes have been employed to investigate the structural and functional alterations in membranes after g-irradiation. Changes in the lipid bilayer in irradiated unilamellar liposomes prepared from egg yolk lecithin (EYL) were measured by using diphenylhexatriene (DPH) as a probe. The observed increase in DPH polarization and decrease in fluorescence intensity after g-irradiation of liposomes imply radiationinduced decrease in bilayer fluidity. Inclusion of cholesterol in liposome was found to protect lipids against radiation damage, possibly by modulation of bilayer organization e.g. lipid packing. Measurements on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes loaded with 6-carboxyfluorescein (CF) showed radiation dose-dependent release of the probe indicating radiation-induced increased permeability. Changes in plasma membrane permeability of thymocytes were monitored by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by 2,7-dichlorodihydro fluorescein diacetate (DCH-FDA). Results suggest a correlation between ROS generation and membrane permeability changes induced by radiation within therapeutic doses (0-10 Gy). It is concluded that increase in membrane permeability was the result of ROS-mediated oxidative reactions, which might trigger processes leading to apoptotic cell death after radiation exposure.</p>

				<title>An immunomodulator from Tinospora cordifolia with antioxidant activity in cell-free systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0713-0719</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several plant products are known to exhibit immense medicinal value against human diseases. Our earlier studies showed that dry stem crude extract (DSCE) of <i>Tinospora cordifolia</i> contained a polyclonal B cell mitogen, G1-4A. DSCE as well as G1-4A also enhanced immune response in mice. In order to explore the possibility of using G1-4A/PPI (partially purified immunomodulator) to modulate radiation induced immunosuppression, the antioxidant effect of PPI from this plant was examined against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), generated by photosensitization/peroxynitrite. Levels of lipid peroxidation products, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in liver/spleen homogenate from mouse were monitored. Photosensitization induced significant increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in liver. The activities of SOD and catalase were reduced considerably. PPI, present during photosensitisation, prevented lipid peroxidation and restored the activities of both the enzymes. Likewise, oxidative damage induced by peroxynitrite was inhibited by PPI. The degradation of proteins due to photosensitization as assessed by SDS-PAGE was effectively reduced by simultaneous treatment with PPI during photosensitization. Selective inhibitors of ROS like mannitol, SOD, sodium azide and antioxidants, GSH and vitamin C brought about significant inhibition of formation of TBARS suggesting possible involvement of O$_2^{-\bullet}$,${}^{\bullet}$OH and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Photosensitization in deuterated buffer enhanced formation of TBARS thus indicating generation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the action of PPI may be against oxidative damage through Type I and II photosensitization mechanisms. Therefore, the immunomodulator from <i>Tinospora cordifolia</i> may also be beneficial as an antioxidant.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Radiation chemical reactions of ${}^{\bullet}$OH, O$^{\bullet -}$, N$_3^{\bullet}$ and $e^-_{aq}$ with ùëú- and ùëö-hydroxycinnamic acids were studied. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH with ortho and meta isomers in buffer solution at ùëùH 7 are $3.9\pm 0.2 \times 10^9$ and $4.4 \pm  0.3 \times 10^9$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> respectively. At ùëùH 3 the rate with the ortho isomer was halved ($1.6 \pm 0.4 \times 10^9$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) but it was unaffected in the case of meta isomer ($k = 4.2 \pm 0.6 \times 10^9$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The rate constant in the reaction of N$_3^{\bullet}$ with the ortho isomer is lower by an order of magnitude ($k = 4.9 \pm 0.4 \times 10^8$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). The rates of the reaction of $e^-_{aq}$ with ortho and meta isomers were found to be diffusion controlled. The transient absorption spectrum measured in the ${}^{\bullet}$OH with ùëú-hydroxycinnamic acid exhibited an absorption maximum at 360 nm and in meta isomer the spectrum was blue-shifted (330 nm) with a shoulder at 390 nm. A peak at 420 nm was observed in the reaction of O$^{\bullet-}$ with the ùëú-isomer whereas the meta isomer has a maximum at 390 and a broad shoulder at 450 nm. In the reaction of $e^-_{aq}$, the absorption peaks were centred at 370-380 nm in both the isomers. The underlying reaction mechanism is discussed.</p>

					<p>The kinetics of the reactions of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms with some aliphatic alcohols in aqueous solutions were studied using pulse radiolysis. Based on the increase in optical absorption in the UV region, the rate constants for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms with methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or ùë°-butyl alcohol were determined to be 9.0 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup>, 2.2 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup>,  2.0 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup>, 6.2 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> and 1.1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>, 1.8 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup>, 5.3  &#215; 10<sup>7</sup>, 2.3  &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> respectively. The bimolecular decay rate constants for the alcohol radicals produced in methanol and ethanol were evaluated to be $2 .4 \times  10^9$ and $1.5 \times 10^9$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

					<p>The free radical scavenging properties and possible antioxidant activity of 1,3-diphenylpropane-1,3-dione (<b>1</b>) are reported. Pulse radiolysis technique was employed to study the one-electron oxidation of <b>1</b> with various radicals viz.

All these radicals reacted with <b>1</b> under ambient conditions at almost diffusion controlled rates producing transient species with an absorption maximum around 420 nm that decayed at first order rates. The transient absorption peak was shifted in the case of CCl<sub>3</sub>OO$^{\bullet}$ radical reaction with <b>1</b> due to change in the polarity of the medium. Formation of a stable product with a broad absorption band starting from 400 nm and cut off at 230 nm was observed in the oxidation of <b>1</b> with ${}^{\bullet}$OH and ${}^{\bullet}$N<sub>3</sub> radicals. In a biological system also, <b>1</b> showed significant inhibitory activity against Fe<sup>2+</sup>-mediated lipid peroxidation. Based on these observations, a suitable mechanism for the oxidation of <b>1</b> has been proposed.</p>

				<title>Effect of electron-withdrawing power of the substituted group on ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical reaction with substituted aryl sulphides: A pulse radiolysis study</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>In neutral aqueous solution of (phenylthio)acetic acid, hydroxyl radical is observed to react with a bimolecular rate constant of $7.2 \times 10^9$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and the transient absorption bands are assigned to ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical addition to benzene and sulphur with a rough estimated values of 50 and 40&#37; respectively. The reaction of the ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical with diphenyl sulphide ($k = 4.3 \times 10^8$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) is observed to take place with formation of solute radical cation, OH-adduct at sulphur and benzene with estimated values of about 12, 28 and 60&#37; respectively. The transient absorption bands observed on reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical, in neutral aqueous solution of 4-(methylthio) phenyl acetic acid, are assigned to solute radical cation ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 550$ and 730 nm), OH-adduct at sulphur ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 360$ nm) and addition at benzene ring ($\lambda_{\text{max}} = 320$ nm). The fraction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical reacting to form solute radical cation is observed to depend on the electron-withdrawing power of substituted group. In acidic solutions, depending on the concentration of acid and electron-withdrawing power, solute radical cation is the only transient species formed on reaction of ${}^{\bullet}$OH radical with the sulphides studied.</p>

					<p>New symmetrical compartmental binucleating ligands 2,6-<i>bis</i>[N-(2-{dimethylamino}ethyl)-N-methyl)aminomethyl]-3,4-dimethylphenol [HL<sup>1</sup>] and 2,6-<i>bis</i>[N-(2-{diethylamino}ethyl)-N-ethyl)aminomethyl]-3,4-dimethylphenol [HL<sup>2</sup>], and their copper(II) complexes [Cu<sub>2</sub>L<sup>1-2</sup>(X)]ClO<sub>4</sub>, (X = NO$_2^-$, OAc<sup>-</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>) have been prepared. Spectral, catalytic, magnetic, EPR and electrochemical studies have been carried out. A catecholase activity study indicates that only HL<sup>1</sup> complexes have efficient catalytic activity due to a less sterically hindered methyl group and enhanced planarity (larger $-2J$ values) with respect to the oxidation of 3,5-di-ùë°-butylcatechol to the corresponding quinone. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility studies of the complexes show antiferromagnetic interaction between the copper atoms. X-band EPR signals could not be observed for polycrystalline samples both at room temperatures and liquid nitrogen, consistent with two antiferrromagnetically coupled copper centres in the solid state. EPR spectral studies in methanol solvent show welldefined four hyperfine signals at room temperature due to decomposition of the dimer into monomers. This however is not seen in frozen methanol glass, may be owing to restructuring of the monomers into dimers due to an increase in viscosity of the solvent. Electrochemical studies revealed chemically irreversible behaviour due to chemical or/and stereochemical changes subsequent to electron transfer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Tetravalent metal acid (TMA) salts are cation exchangers due to the presence of structural hydroxyl groups. The presence of protons makes the TMA salt, a potential candidate for solid state protonic conduction. In the present endeavour, amorphous inorganic ion exchangers of the class of TMA salts, tin tungstate (SnW), titanium tungstate (TiW) and zirconium tungstate (ZrW) have been synthesized and characterized for elemental analysis, thermal analysis (TGA, DSC), FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray analysis. Chemical resistivity of these materials have been assessed in various acidic, basic and organic media. Ion exchange capacity has been determined and effect of heating on ion exchange capacity has been studied. The proton conduction behaviour of these materials has been studied by measuring specific conductance (ùúé) at different temperatures in the range 30-175&#176;C using HP 4192 A impedance analyzer. The specific conductance values for the three materials have been compared.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ligand N,N'-diformylhydrazine (DFH) is a resonance hybrid of its keto- and enol-forms. The resonance structures indicate enolisation of one as well as both the carbonyl groups. This indicates the presence of dissociable protons in the molecule. Equilibrium studies carried out with DFH indicate the presence of one dissociable proton. The solid complexes of Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) with DFH have been synthesized, and have been characterized by elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, IR, Far-IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, TGA, FAB and reflectance spectra. IR and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the complexes indicate deprotonation of both the enol protons upon complexation. Elemental and TG analyses of Mn(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) DFH complexes indicate 1 : 1 metal to ligand composition. The dimeric nature of the Mn(II)-DFH complex is supported by its FAB spectrum.</p>

				<title>Cobalt (II)-EDTA complex as a new reductant for phosphomolybdic acid used for the assay of trazodone</title>
				<feature>Inorganic and Analytical</feature>
				<page>0029-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new spectrophotometric method for the assay of trazodone (TZ) has been described. TZ forms a complex in stoichiometric proportions with phosphomolybdic acid. The released phosphomolybdic acid from the complex with acetone is reduced with a new reductant (cobalt nitrate-ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid) to molybdenum blue, which has maximum absorption at 840 nm. Beer's law limits, precision and accuracy of the methods are checked by the UV reference method. This method is found to be suitable for the assay of TZ in the presence of other ingredients that are usually present in tablets. Recoveries are almost quantitative.</p>

				<title>Carbocation lifetimes and entropy of water addition to carbocations dependent on their stability</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0041-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Iminodiazonium ions (ùõº-azidobenzyl carbocations) were produced in aqueous solution by chemical initiation (solvolysis) of benzyl-<i>gem</i>-diazides. Solvolysis reactions of benzyl-<i>gem</i>-diazides in water proceed by a stepwise mechanism through ùõº-azidobenzyl carbocation intermediates, which are captured by water to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds as the sole detectable products. Rate constant ratio $k_{az}/k_s$ (M<sup>-1</sup>) for partitioning of the carbocation between reaction with azide ion and reaction with water was determined by analysis of azide common ion inhibition of the solvolysis reaction. Rate constants $k_s$ (s<sup>-1</sup>) for the reaction of the cation with solvent water were determined from the experimental values of $k_{az}/k_s$ and $k_{\text{solv}}$, for the solvolysis of the benzyl-<i>gem</i>-diazides, using $k_{\text{az}} = 5 \times 10^9$ M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for diffusion-limited reactions of azide ion with ùõº-azidobenzyl carbocations. Values of $1/k_s$ were thus the lifetimes of the ùõº-azidobenzyl carbocations. From the study of effect of temperature on $k_{\text{solv}}$ and $k_s$ the activation parameters are determined and discussed.</p>

				<title>Measures to evaluate heteroaromaticity and their limitations: Story of skeletally substituted benzenes</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0049-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Ab initio</i> HF, MP2, CCSD(T) and hybrid density functional B3LYP calculations were performed on a series of skeletally mono- and di-substituted benzenes, (CH)<sub>5</sub>Z and (CH)<sub>4</sub>Z<sub>2</sub>, Z = C<sup>-</sup>, N, O<sup>+</sup>, Si<sup>-</sup>, P, S<sup>+</sup>, Ge<sup>-</sup>, As, Se<sup>+</sup>, BH<sup>-</sup>, NH<sup>+</sup>, AlH<sup>-</sup>, SiH, PH<sup>+</sup>, GaH<sup>-</sup>, GeH and AsH<sup>+</sup>. Various measures of aromaticity such as the bond length equalization, homodesmic equations, singlet-triplet energy difference (DE$_{s-t}$), chemical hardness (ùúÇ) and out-of-plane distortive tendency are critically analysed. The relative energy ordering in skeletally disubstituted benzenes displays trends that are inexplicable based on conventional wisdom. In general, the orthoisomer is found to be the least stable when the substituent is from the second row, whereas if the substituent is from the fourth row, the ortho-isomer is the most stable. Various qualitative arguments, including (a) lone pair-lone pair repulsion, (b) the sum of bond strengths in the twin Kekule forms, and (c) the rule of topological charge stabilization (TCS), are used to explain the observed relative energy trends. The rule of TCS in conjunction with the sum of bond strengths is found to predict the relative energy ordering reasonably well. The reactivity of this class of compounds is assessed based on their singlet-triplet energy differences, chemical hardness and the frequencies corresponding to out-of-plane skeletal distortions. These reactivity indices show less kinetic stability for the compounds with substituents from the fourth row and point to the fact that the thermodynamically most stable compounds need not be the least reactive ones. The $\Delta E_{s-t}$ values indicate that the ùúã-framework of benzene weakens upon skeletal substitutions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation of nine aliphatic primary alcohols by quinolinium bromochromate (QBC) in dimethylsulphoxide leads to the formation of the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction is first order with respect to both QBC and the alcohol. The reaction is catalysed by hydrogen ions. The hydrogen-ion dependence has the form: $k_{\text{obs}} = a + b$[H<sup>+</sup>]. The oxidation of [1,1-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]ethanol (MeCD<sub>2</sub>OH) exhibits a substantial primary kinetic isotope effect. The reaction has been studied in nineteen different organic solvents. The solvent effect was analysed using Taft‚Äôs and Swain's multiparametric equations. The rate of oxidation is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of the substituents. A suitable mechanism has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics and equilibria of axial ligation of bromomethyl(aquo) cobaloxime by a series of straight chain primary amines (methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, pentylamine, hexylamine), cycloamines (cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, cycloheptylamine) and secondary amines (N,N-dimethylamine, N,N-diethylamine) have been measured as functions of pH by spectrophotometric technique in aqueous solution, ionic strength 1 M (KCl) at 25&#176;C. The rate of substitution of H<sub>2</sub>O varies with the ùëùKa of incoming ligand, thus establishing nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. Binding and kinetic data are interpreted based on the basicity and steric influence of the entering ligand. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands, pH independent second-order rate constants ($k_{\text{on}}$) are calculated.</p>

The free acids and their hydrazinium salts have been characterized by analytical, IR spectroscopic and thermal studies. IR spectra of all the salts show N-N stretching frequencies of the N<sub>2</sub>H$_5^+$ ion in the region 975-960 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The thermoanalytical behaviour of the free acids and their salts has been investigated by simultaneous TG and DTA. While pyrazinecarboxylic acid shows single-step endothermic (229&#176;C) complete decomposition, pyrazindicarboxylic acid shows exothermic decarboxylation followed by identical endothermic decomposition as that of the former. Similarly, salts of the monocarboxylic acid show endothermic effects during pyrolysis, whereas salts of the dicarboxylic acid show endothermic followed by exothermic decomposition. The acids and their salts both undergo complete decomposition to gaseous products.</p>

				<title>Regioselective nitration of aromatic substrates in zeolite cages</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0113-0121</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Phenol is nitrated regioselectively by fuming nitric acid inside the cages of faujasite zeolites (dependent on the loading level) and a remarkable orthoselectivity is observed in solid state nitration. Toluene and chlorobenzene also containing ortho-/para-orienting substituents, undergo faster nitration, though the regioselectivity is less significant in zeolite media. The results are explained on the basis of diffusion and binding of phenol inside zeolite, which facilitate regioselectivity (and which is absent in toluene and chlorobenzene). Other advantages of employing zeolites as media for mild and selective nitration are also highlighted.</p>

				<title>Kinetics and mechanism of protection of thymine from sulphate radical anion under anoxic conditions</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0123-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rates of photooxidation of thymine in presence of peroxydisulphate (PDS) have been determined by measuring the absorbance of thymine at 264 nm spectrophotometrically. The rates and the quantum yields (ùúô) of oxidation of thymine by sulphate radical anion have been determined in the presence of different concentrations of caffeic acid. Increase in [caffeic acid] is found to decrease the rate of oxidation of thymine suggesting that caffeic acid acts as an efficient scavenger of SO$^{\bullet -}_4$ and protects thymine from it. Sulphate radical anion competes for thymine as well as for caffeic acid. The rate constant of sulphate radical anion with caffeic acid has been calculated to be $1.24 \times 10^{10}$ dm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The quantum yields of photooxidation of thymine have been calculated from the rates of oxidation of thymine and the light intensity absorbed by PDS at 254 nm, the wavelength at which PDS is activated to sulphate radical anion. From the results of experimentally determined quantum yields ($\phi_{\text{exptl}}$) and the quantum yields calculated ($\phi_{\text{cl}}$) assuming caffeic acid acting only as a scavenger of SO$^{\bullet -}_4$ radicals show that $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values are lower than $\phi_{\text{cl}}$ values. The $\phi'$ values, which are experimentally found quantum yield values at each caffeic acid concentration and corrected for SO$^{\bullet-}_4$ scavenging by caffeic acid, are also found to be greater than $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values. These observations suggest that the thymine radicals are repaired by caffeic acid in addition to scavenging of sulphate radical anions.</p>

				<page>0129-0134</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidation of meta- and para-substituted benzylamines by cetyltrimethylammonium permanganate (CTAP) to the corresponding aldimines is first order with respect to both the amine and CTAP. Oxidation of deuteriated benzylamine (PhCD<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) exhibited the presence of a substantial kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 5.60$ at 293 K). This confirmed the cleavage of an ùõº-C-H bond in the ratedetermining step. Correlation analyses of the rates of oxidation of 19 monosubstituted benzylamines were performed with various single and multiparametric equations. The rates of the oxidation showed excellent correlations in terms of Yukawa-Tsuno and Brown‚Äôs equations. The polar reaction constants are negative. The oxidation exhibited an extensive cross-conjugation, in the transition state, between the electron-donating substituents and the reaction centre. A mechanism involving a hydride-ion transfer from the amine to CTAP in the rate-determining step has been proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of oxidation of five vicinal and four non-vicinal diols, and two of their monoethers, by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) has been studied. The vicinal diols yield products arising out of glycol-bond fission, while the non-vicinal diols produce the hydroxycarbonyl compounds. The reaction is first-order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis-Menten type kinetics is observed with respect to diols. The reaction fails to induce the polymerization of acrylonitrile. There is no effect of tetrabutylammonium chloride on the reaction rate. The proposed reactive oxidizing species is the tribromide ion. The effect of solvent composition indicates that the rate increases with increase in the polarity of the solvent. The oxidation of [1,1,2,2-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>4</sub>] ethanediol shows the absence of any primary kinetic isotope effect. Values of solvent isotope effect, ùëò(H<sub>2</sub>O)/ùëò(D<sub>2</sub>O), at 288 K for the oxidation of ethanediol, propane-1,3-diol and 3-methoxybutan-1-ol are 3.41, 0.98 and 1.02 respectively. A mechanism involving a glycol-bond fission has been proposed for the oxidation of vicinal diols. Non-vicinal diols are oxidised by a hydride-transfer mechanism, as they are monohydric alcohols.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Density and refractive index have been experimentally determined for binary liquid mixtures of hexadecane and heptadecane with 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol and 1-heptanol at 298.15, 308.15 and 318.15 K. A comparative study of Lorentz-Lorenz (L-L), Weiner (W) and Heller (H), and Gladstone-Dale (G-D) relations for predicting the refractive index of a liquid has been carried out to test their validity for the eight binaries over the entire mole fraction range of hexadecane and heptadecane at the three temperatures. Comparison of various mixing rules has been expressed in terms of average percentage deviation. The performance of the Lorentz- Lorenz and Heller relations is relatively better than that of the Weiner and Gladstone-Dale relations.</p>

					<p>Metal ion uptake properties of polystyrene-supported chelating polymer resins functionalized with (i) glycine, (ii) hydroxy benzoic acid, (iii) Schiff base and (iv) diethanol amine have been investigated. The effects of pH, time and initial concentration on the uptake of metal ions have been studied. The uptake of metal ion depends on pH. The resins are more selective at pH 10 for Pb(II) and Hg(II), whereas at pH 6 they are found to be Cd(II) and Cr(VI) selective. Metal ion uptake properties of resins follow Freundlich‚Äôs equation. The resins are recyclable and are therefore employed for the removal of heavy metal pollutants from industrial waste water.</p>

					<p>Neutral tetradentate N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> type complexes of Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Zn(II) have been synthesised using the Schiff base formed by the condensation of acetylacetone and p-anisidine. Microanalysis, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, IR, UV-Vis, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, CV and EPR studies have been carried out to determine the structure of the complexes. From the data, it is found that all the complexes possess square-planar geometry. The EPR spectrum of the copper complex in DMSO at 300 K and 77 K was recorded and its salient features are reported. All the title complexes were screened for antimicrobial activity by the well diffusion technique using DMSO as solvent. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were calculated at 37&#176;C for a period of 24 h. It has been found that all the complexes are antimicrobially active and show higher activity than the free ligand.</p>

Formation of HDA-capped gold nanoparticles is accomplished by a simple biphasic mixture experiment wherein the molecule hexadecylaniline present in the organic phase leads to electrostatic complexation and reduction of aqueous chloroaurate ions, capping of the gold nanoparticles thus formed and phase transfer of the now hydrophobic particles into the organic phase. Organization of gold nanoparticles at the air-water interface is followed by surface pressure-area isotherm measurements while the formation of multilayer films of the nanoparticles by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique is monitored by quartz crystal microgravimetry, UVVis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-photon dissociation of Freon-22 (CF<sub>2</sub>HCl) at low temperatures has been carried out to separate the C-13 isotope using a TEA CO<sub>2</sub> laser. Yield and enrichment of C-13 isotope in the product C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> are studied at 9ùëÉ(22) laser line as a function of temperature (-50&#176;C to 30&#176;C). It is observed that at a given fluence when the temperature is lowered the yield decreases and the enrichment factor of C-13 increases.</p>
					<p>Room temperature irradiation of CF<sub>2</sub>HCl towards the blue edge of C-13 absorption (i.e. at 9ùëÉ(20) laser line) gives low yield of the product (C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>) at a fluence, which produces the desired enrichment factor of 100. An increase in fluence gives very high yield of C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> but the enrichment factor is very low. Irradiating CF<sub>2</sub>HCl at a temperature of -10&#176;C enhances the enrichment factor to 100 and the yield obtained is comparable to that towards the red edge of C-13 absorption (i.e. at 9ùëÉ(26) laser line).</p>
					<p>At a given enrichment factor higher enrichment efficiency is achieved when CF<sub>2</sub>HCl is irradiated at lower temperature.</p>

					<p>pH potentiometric and spectrophotometric investigations on the complex formation equilibria of Cu<sup>II</sup> with iminodiacetate (ida<sup>2-</sup>) and heterocyclic N-bases, viz. imidazole and benzimidazole (B), in aqueous solution in binary and ternary systems using different molar ratios of the reactants indicated the formation of complexes of the types, Cu(ida), Cu(ida)(OH)<sup>-</sup>, (ida)Cu(OH)Cu(ida)<sup>-</sup>, Cu(B)<sup>2+</sup>, Cu(H<sub>-1</sub>B)<sup>+</sup>, Cu(ida)(H<sub>-1</sub>B)<sup>-</sup>, (ida)Cu(B)Cu(ida) and (ida)Cu(H<sub>-1</sub>B)Cu(ida)<sup>-</sup>.

Departure of the experimental values of the reproportionation constants ($\Delta \log K_{\text{Cu}}$) of ternary Cu(ida)(H<sub>-1</sub>B)<sup>-</sup> complexes from the statistically expected values, despite their formation in appreciable amounts at equilibrium, were assigned to fac(f)-mer(m) equilibria of the ida<sup>2-</sup> ligand coordinated to Cu<sup>II</sup>, as the N-heterocyclic donors, (H<sub>-1</sub>B)<sup>-</sup>, coordinate <i>trans</i>- to the N-(ida<sup>2-</sup>) atom in the binary Cu(ida)$_f$ complex to form the ternary Cu(ida)$_m$(H<sub>-1</sub>B)<sup>-</sup> complexes.</p>

				<title>Solvent effects on some new <i>meso</i>-aryl substituted octabromoporphyrins</title>
				<feature>Organic</feature>
				<page>0263-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of porphyrins with tolyl and naphthyl substituents at the meso positions, their octabromoderivatives (OBP) with Br substituents at ùõΩ-pyrrole positions are synthesised and characterised by chemical analysis, 1H NMR and electronic spectral studies. It is seen that all the OBPs exhibit pronounced red shifts in both the Soret and ùëÑ bands of their electronic spectra compared to their nonbrominated form in various polar and nonpolar solvents, the energy difference $\Delta\bar{v}$ being in the range 2300-2700 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The high energy ùêµ band of naphthyl porphyrins (both brominated and nonbrominated) are found to be more red-shifted than that of tolyl porphyrins, owing to the noticeable mesomeric effect of the naphthyl groups. Detailed spectral studies reveal that while none of the nonbrominated porphyrin show solvent-dependent change in their $B$ and ùëÑ bands, all the OBPs manifest significant shifts depending on the nature of solvents. Solvent-solute interaction can be considered to be of strong dipole-dipole nature for OBPs with polar solvents and of ùúã - ùúã type with aromatic non-polar solvents. In the brominated form we find two categories of porphyrins exhibiting distinctly different absorption phenomena in aromatic solvents. The OBPs having <i>meso</i>-groups not shielding the porphyrin ùúã-framework exhibit additional absorption peaks (split Soret peaks and broadened Q bands) in some aromatic solvents. This could be explained in terms of ùúã - ùúã type donor-acceptor (DA) complex formation between such bromoporphyrins (acceptor) and the aromatic solvent molecules (donor) that is not possible for OBPs that have bulky <i>meso</i> groups that block the approach of aromatic solvent molecules close to the porphyrin framework.</p>

				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoamination of 4-nitroveratrole in cyclodextrins with the nucleophiles ammonia, methylamine and hexylamine provides a new route to regioselectivity. This method gives a displaced product para to the nitro group as the predominant product, in contrast to the solution reaction wherein the meta-displaced product predominates. This is due to the change in the mechanistic shift from S$_N$2Ar<sup>&#8727;</sup>, wherein the nitro group is meta-directing, to a mechanism involving electron transfer from the nucleophile to the excited aromatic substrate (S$_N$ (ET)Ar<sup>&#8727;</sup>) to give the para-displaced product.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Combustion of dilute propane (0.9 mol &#37;) over Mn-doped ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalysts prepared using different precipitating agents (viz. TMAOH, TEAOH, TPAOH, TBAOH and NH<sub>4</sub>OH), having different Mn/Zr ratios (0.05 - 0.67) and calcined at different temperatures (500-800&#176;C), has been thoroughly investigated at different temperatures (300-500&#176;C) and space velocities (25,000-100,000 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) for controlling propane emissions from LPG-fuelled vehicles. Mn-doped ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst shows high propane combustion activity, particularly when its ZrO<sub>2</sub> is in the cubic form, when its Mn/Zr ratio is close to 0.2 and when it is prepared using TMAOH as a precipitating agent and calcined at 500-600&#176;C. Pulse reaction of propane in the absence of free-O<sub>2</sub> over Mn-doped ZrO<sub>2</sub> (cubic) and Mn-impregnated ZrO<sub>2</sub> (monoclinic) catalysts has also been investigated for studying the relative reactivity and mobility of the lattice oxygen of the two catalysts. Both reactivity and mobility of the lattice oxygen of Mn-doped ZrO<sub>2</sub> are found to be much higher than that of Mnimpregnated ZrO<sub>2</sub>. Propane combustion over Mn-doped ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst involves a redox mechanism.</p>

				<title>Effect of NaCl on the spectral and kinetic properties of cresyl violet (CV)-sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) complex</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0299-0306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effect of added NaCl on the spectral and kinetic properties of cationically charged dye (cresyl violet) and anionically charged surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate) were studied in the pre-micellar and micellar regions. Addition of 0.2M NaCl to dye-surfactant solution decreased the critical micellar concentration for the micellization of the dye in sodium dodecyl sulphate to $1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ M. Time-resolved studies using a stopped-flow spectrometer showed that NaCl influences the dynamics of micellisation. Addition of NaCl during the dye-surfactant complex formation converted the complex into micellized form at NaCl concentration of 0.01 to 0.05 M. In contrast, much higher concentration of NaCl (2 M) is required for the salting-out effect of the dye-surfactant complex for conversion to the micellized form.</p>

				<title>Kinetics of proton transfer in a green fluorescent protein: A laser-induced pH jump study</title>
				<feature>Physical and Theoretical</feature>
				<page>0307-0317</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sub-millisecond protonation dynamics of the chromophore in S65T mutant form of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was tracked after a rapid pH jump following laser-induced proton release from the caged photolabile compound o-nitrobenzaldehyde. Following a jump in pH from 8 to 5 (which is achieved within 2 ùúás), the fluorescence of S65T GFP decreased as a single exponential with a time constant of $\tilde 90 \mu$s. This decay is interpreted as the conversion of the deprotonated fluorescent GFP chromophore to a protonated non-fluorescent species. The protonation kinetics showed dependence on the bulk viscosity of the solvent, and therefore implicates bulk solvent-controlled protein dynamics in the protonation process. The protonation is proposed to be a sequential process involving two steps: (a) proton transfer from solvent to the chromophore, and (b) internal structural rearrangements to stabilize a protonated chromophore. The possible implications of these observations to protein dynamics in general is discussed.</p>

				<title>Rigid rod spaced fullerene as building block for nanoclusters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0321-0332</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By using phenylacetylene based rigid-rod linkers (PhA), we have successfully synthesized two fullerene derivatives, C<sub>60</sub>-PhA and C<sub>60</sub>-PhA-C<sub>60</sub>. The absorption spectral features of C<sub>60</sub>, as well as that of the phenylacetylene moiety are retained in the monomeric forms of these fullerene derivatives, ruling out the possibility of any strong interaction between the two chromophores in the ground state. Both the fullerene derivatives form optically transparent clusters, absorbing in the UV-Vis region; this clustering leads to a significant increase in their molar extinction coefficients. TEM characterization of the C<sub>60</sub>-PhA showed large spherical clusters, with sizes ranging from 150-350 nm, while an elongated wire-type structure was observed for the bisfullerene derivative (C<sub>60</sub>-PhA-C<sub>60</sub>). AFM section analysis studies of isolated nanoclusters of C<sub>60</sub>-PhA-C<sub>60</sub>, deposited on mica, indicate that smaller clusters associate to form larger nanostructures.</p>

				<title>Electrical conduction in composites containing copper core-copper oxide shell nanostructure in silica gel</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0341-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Composites of nanometre-sized copper core-copper oxide shell with diameters in the range 6.1 to 7.3 nm dispersed in a silica gel were synthesised by a technique comprising reduction followed by oxidation of a suitably chosen precursor gel. The hot pressed gel powders mixed with nanometre-sized copper particles dispersed in silica gel showed electrical resistivities several orders of magnitude lower than that of the precursor gel. Electrical resistivities of the different specimens were measured over the temperature range 30 to 300&#176;C. Activation energies for the coreshell nanostructured composites were found to be a fraction of that of the precursor gel. Such dramatic changes are ascribed to the presence of an interfacial amorphous phase. The resistivity variation as a function of temperature was analysed on the basis of Mott‚Äôs small polaron hopping conduction model. The effective dielectric constant of the interfacial phase as extracted from the data analysis was found to be much higher than that of the precursor glass. This has been explained as arising from the generation of very high pressure at the interface due to the oxidation step to which the copper nanoparticles are subjected.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0349-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the NO molecule, modelled as a Morse oscillator, time-dependent (TD) nuclear Schr√∂dinger equation has been numerically solved for the multiphoton vibrational dynamics of the molecule under a far-infrared laser of wavelength 10503 nm, and four different intensities, $I = 1 \times  10^8$, $1 \times  10^{13}$, $5  \times  10<sup>16</sup>, and $5 \times 10<sup>18</sup>W cm<sup>-2</sup> respectively. Starting from the vibrational ground state at zero time, various TD quantities such as the norm, dissociation probability, potential energy curve and dipole moment are examined. Rich high-harmonics generation (HHG) spectra and above-threshold dissociation (ATD) spectra, due to the multiphoton interaction of vibrational motions with the laser field, and consequent elevation to the vibrational continuum, have been obtained and analysed.</p>

				<title>Proline and benzylpenicillin derivatives grafted into mesoporous MCM-41: Novel organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts for direct aldol reaction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0365-0372</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts were synthesized by covalent grafting of proline and benzylpenicillin derivatives into mesoporous MCM-41. These catalysts were extensively characterized using FT-IR, <sup>13</sup>C CP MAS solid state NMR, XRD and TEM techniques. These were used as catalysts for direct, asymmetric aldol reaction between acetone and activated aromatic aldehydes. In the reaction of 4-nitro and 4-fluoro benzaldehyde, the aldol products were obtained in 36&#37; and 59&#37; <i>ee</i> respectively. The catalysts were reusable with neither significant drop in enantioselectivity nor loss of mesostructure. An attempt was made to substantiate the proposed `enamine‚Äô mechanism for direct aldol reaction by trapping the intermediate between proline-MCM-41 and acetone.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Initial growth stages of the ultra thin films of germanium (Ge) prepared by ion beam sputter deposition have been studied using atomic force microscope (AFM) and interference enhanced Raman scattering. The growth of the films follows Volmer-Weber growth mechanism. Analysis of the AFM images shows that Ostwald ripening of the grains occurs as the thickness of the film increases. Raman spectra of the Ge films reveal phonon confinement along the growth direction and show that the misfit strain is relieved for film thickness greater than 4 nm.</p>

The molybdates crystallize in the space group $P6_3/m$ with a &#8764; 10.5 and $c \sim 3.7$ √Ö. Unlike previous studies, our work suggests that hexagonal molybdates could be stabilized in the presence of monovalent cations with varying ionic size (smaller lithium to larger cesium) under hydrothermal condition. The phases showed exceptional thermal stability till 550&#176;C.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We describe a novel process for the production of nanoparticles of Cu, Ag, Fe and Al which involves exploding their respective wires, triggered by large current densities in the wires. The particles are characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Particle sizes in the range 20-100nm were obtained employing this technique. The XRD results reveal that the nanoparticles continue to retain lattice periodicity at reduced particle sizes, displaying in some cases evidence of lattice strain and preferential orientation. In the case of Fe, Mossbauer spectroscopy reveals loss of ferromagnetism as a result of the reduced size of the particles.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0519-0524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fine powders of lanthanum iron oxide, LaFeO<sub>3</sub>, have been prepared by solid state reaction as well as sol-gel synthesis and nebulized spray pyrolysis. Structures, morphologies and magnetic susceptibility measurements of these powders have been examined. The powders prepared by all the three low-temperature routes contain nearly spherical particles with an average diameter of 40 nm. These samples show a lower Neel temperature than the powder prepared by solid state reaction besides showing much lower magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures.</p>

					<p>The formation of ùõΩ-phase Bi<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub> catalyst from a precursor precipitate has been studied using the <i>in situ</i> combined XRD/QuEXAFS technique and DSC during calcination. Accordingly the precursor was observed to undergo a number of changes in both the molybdenum (VI) coordination and long-range ordering during this heating. Initially the two other forms of bismuth molybdate (ùõº-and ùõæ-phases) were observed to form from the poorly crystalline precursor at about 230&#176;C, however, the ùõΩ-phase eventually crystallised after prolonged heating at 560&#176;C.</p>

				<title>Electrostatic potential profile and nonlinear current in an interacting one-dimensional molecular wire</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0533-0542</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We consider an interacting one-dimensional molecular wire attached to two metal electrodes on either side of it. The electrostatic potential profile across the wire-electrode interface has been deduced solving the Schrodinger and Poisson equations self-consistently. Since the Poisson distribution crucially depends on charge densities, we have considered different Hamiltonian parameters to model the nanoscale wire. We find that for very weak electron correlations, the potential gradient is almost zero in the middle of the wire but are large near the chain ends. However, for strong correlations, the potential is essentially a ramp function. The nonlinear current, obtained from the scattering formalism, is found to be less with the ramp potential than for weak correlations. Some of the interesting features in current-voltage characteristics have been explained using one-electron formalism and instabilities in the system.</p>

				<title>Influence of temperature inhomogeneity on product profile of reactions occurring within zeolites</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0543-0552</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In zeolites, diffusion is often accompanied by a reaction or sorption which in turn can induce temperature inhomogeneities. Monte Carlo simulations of Lennard-Jones atoms in zeolite NaCaA are reported for the presence of a hot zone presumed to be created by a reaction or chemi- or physi-sorption site. These simulations show that the presence of localized hot regions can alter both kinetic and transport properties such as diffusion. Further, we show that enhancement of diffusion constant is greater for systems with larger barrier height, a surprising result that may be of considerable significance in many chemical and biological processes. We find an unanticipated coupling between reaction and diffusion due to the presence of a hot zone in addition to that which normally exists via concentration. Implications of this coupling for the product profile of a reaction are discussed. We also propose a mechanism by which mobility of ions or diffusion of molecular species within biomembranes may take place.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The results of X-ray diffraction, and ac and dc magnetisation as a function of temperature are reported for a new class of spin-chain oxides, Ca<sub>3</sub>Co$_{1+x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O<sub>6</sub>. While the ùë• = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 are found to form in the K<sub>4</sub>CdCl<sub>6</sub>-derived rhombhohedral (space group $R\bar{3}c$) structure, the ùë• = 0.7 composition is found to undergo a monoclinic distortion in contrast to a literature report. Apparently, the change in the crystal symmetry with x manifests itself as a change in the sign of paramagnetic Curie temperature for this composition as though magnetic coupling sensitively depends on such crystallographic distortions. All the compositions exhibit spin-glass anomalies with an unusually <i>large</i> frequency dependence of the peak temperature in $ac$ susceptibility in a temperature range below 50 K, interestingly obeying Vogel-Fulcher relationship even for the stoichiometric compounds.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0561-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ce-Zn-O mixed oxides were prepared by amorphous citrate process and decomposition of the corresponding acetate precursors. The resulting materials were characterised by TGA, XRD, UV-Vis-DRS, EPR, SEM and surface area measurements. XRD and DRS results indicated fine dispersion of the ceria component in the ZnO matrix. EPR results clearly indicate the presence of oxygen vacancy and defect centres in the composite oxide. Addition of CeO<sub>2</sub> to ZnO produced mixed oxides of high surface area compared to the pure ZnO. Hydrogen transfer reaction was carried out on these catalytic materials to investigate the effect of rare earth oxide on the activity of ZnO. Addition of ceria into zinc oxide was found to increase the catalytic activity for hydrogen transfer reaction. The catalytic activity also depended on the method of preparation. Citrate process results in uniformly dispersed mixed oxide with higher catalytic activity.</p>

The Y ions in <b>I</b> are present in four different coordination environments with respect to the oxygen atoms (CN6 = octahedral, CN7 = pentagonal bipyramid, CN8 = dodecahedron and CN9 =capped square antiprism). The oxygen atoms of the 1,2-BDC are fully deprotonated, and show variations in their connectivity with Y atoms. The Y atoms themselves are connected through their vertices forming infinite Y-O-Y one-dimensional chains. The Y-O-Y chains are cross-linked by the 1,2-BDC anions forming a corrugated layer structure. The layers are supported by favourable $\pi \ldots \pi$ interactions between the benzene rings of the 1,2-BDC anions. The variations in the coordination environment of the Y atoms and the presence of Y-O-Y interactions along with the favourable $\pi \ldots \pi$ interactions between the benzene rings from different layers are noteworthy structural features.

				<title>Properties of CMR composites</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0587-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) composites form an interesting field of study. The intrinsic CMR, governed by the intragrain transport of the conduction electrons through the double exchange, limits its application owing to the high field requirement and generally low transition temperatures. Extrinsic CMR, a function of the intergrain transport between ferromagnetic (FM) particles, plays a crucial role in enhancing low field magnetoresistance (LFMR) or increasing room temperature magnetoresistance. Since extrinsic CMR is a grain boundary controlled phenomena, magnetically dirty grain boundaries in the virgin state of the sample help in achieving a high LFMR or increase the field sensitivity. In this article, we give the properties of different composites of magnetoresistive LCMO or LSMO where the second component is (a) an insulating phase, (b) a conducting phase, (c) a nonmagnetic phase and (d) a magnetic phase. We present here some of our recent work on CMR composites where the CMR phase is chosen as LCMO and SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, ZrO<sub>2</sub> and SiCN have been used as the different second phase of the composites. We summarise some of the salient features of the results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nanoparticles have properties that can be fine-tuned by their size as well as shape. Hence, there is significant current interest in preparing nano-materials of small size dispersity and to arrange them in close-packed aggregates. This manuscript describes ways of synthesising gold nanoparticles using a metal-chelator derivative <b>1</b>, as stabiliser. Controlled synthesis conditions lead to formation of nanoparticles thereby indicating the ability of <b>1</b> to act as efficient stabiliser. The nanoparticles formed were characterised by transmission electron microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. TEM analysis showed the formation of dense aggregates of nanoparticles. This can be ascribed to the inter-particle hydrogen bonding possible by the carboxylic acid moiety of <b>1</b> that leads to aggregation. The aggregation can be controlled by the pH of the solution employed for dispersing the particles.</p>

				<title>Probing folding free energy landscape of small proteins through minimalistic models: Folding of HP-36 and ùõΩ-amyloid</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0621-0636</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Folding dynamics and energy landscape picture of protein conformations of HP-36 and ùõΩ-amyloid (AùõΩ) are investigated by extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, where the inter amino acid interactions are given by a minimalistic model (MM) we recently introduced [<i>J. Chem. Phys.</i> <b>118</b> 4733 (2003)]. In this model, a protein is constructed by taking two atoms for each amino acid. One atom represents the backbone C$_{\alpha}$ atom, while the other mimics the whole side chain residue. Sizes and interactions of the side residues are all different and specific to a particular amino acid. The effect of water-mediated folding is mapped into the MM by suitable choice of interaction parameters of the side residues obtained from the amino acid hydropathy scale. A new non-local helix potential is incorporated to generate helices at the appropriate positions in a protein. Simulations have been done by equilibrating the protein at high temperature followed by a sudden quench. The subsequent folding is monitored to observe the dynamics of topological contacts ($N_{topo}$), relative contact order parameter (RCO), and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the realprotein native structure. The folded structures of different model proteins (HP-36 and $A\beta$) resemble their respective real native state rather well. The dynamics of folding shows <i>multistage decay</i>, with an initial hydrophobic collapse followed by a long plateau. Analysis of $N_{topo}$ and RCO correlates the late stage folding with rearrangement of the side chain residues, particularly those far apart in the sequence. The long plateau also signifies large entropic free energy barrier near the native state, as predicted from theories of protein folding.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An experimental charge density study has been carried out on perylene based on X-ray diffraction measurements at 130 K. The electron density and its associated properties have been evaluated at the bond and the ring critical points for the naphthalene residues as well as for the central ring. The variation of the Laplacian along the axis, above and below the ring plane, is found to be symmetric for the central ring while for the naphthalene rings, the Laplacian values are enhanced under the bow-shaped region. A plot of the Laplacian versus density evaluated at various points along the axis above the ring plane, shows a steep variation in the case of the central ring implying that the ùúã-density is smeared out compared to that over the naphthalene rings. Similar data extracted from a quinoid ring and a regular phenyl ring (both based on earlier reports from this laboratory) exhibit increasingly shallower trends and indicate, by contrast, that the central ring of perylene is much less aromatic.</p>

					<p>We present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ùëõ-hexane on the basal plane of graphite at monolayer and multilayer coverages. In keeping with experimental data, we find the presence of ordered adsorbed layers both at single monolayer coverage and when the adsorbed layer coexists with excess liquid adsorbate. Using a simulation method that does not impose any particular periodicity on the adsorbed layer, we quantitatively compare our results to the results of neutron diffraction experiments and find a structural transition from a uniaxially incommensurate lattice to a fully commensurate structure on increasing the coverage from a monolayer to a multilayer. The zig-zag backbone planes of all the alkane molecules lie parallel to the graphite surface at the multilayer coverage, while a few molecules are observed to attain the perpendicular orientation at monolayer coverage.</p>

				<title>Water-dispersible nanoparticles via interdigitation of sodium dodecylsulphate molecules in octadecylamine-capped gold nanoparticles at a liquid-liquid interface</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0679-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the formation of water-dispersible gold nanoparticles capped with a bilayer of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) and octadecylamine (ODA) molecules. Vigorous shaking of a biphasic mixture consisting of ODA-capped gold nanoparticles in chloroform and SDS in water results in the rapid phase transfer of ODA-capped gold nanoparticles from the organic to the aqueous phase, the latter acquiring a pink, foam-like appearance in the process. Drying of the coloured aqueous phase results in the formation of a highly stable, reddish powder of gold nanoparticles that may be readily redispersed in water. The water-dispersible gold nanoparticles have been investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). These studies indicate the presence of interdigitated bilayers consisting of an ODA primary monolayer directly coordinated to the gold nanoparticle surface and a secondary monolayer of SDS, this secondary monolayer providing sufficient hydrophilicity to facilitate gold nanoparticle transfer into water and rendering them water-dispersible.</p>

				<title>A low-cost Raman spectrometer design used to study Raman scattering from a single-walled carbon nanotube</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0689-0694</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper discusses the design of a low cost Raman spectrometer. Singlewalled nanotubes (SWNT) have been studied to demonstrate the reach of such a system. We observe both the radial-breathing mode (RBM) and the tangential mode from the SWNT. The tube diameters of the SWNT used in these experiments have been determined using RBM to be predominantly 1.4 and 1.6nm. These are consistent with the TEM images taken of the same sample. The new method of producing SWNT using Ni-Y catalyst in electric-arc discharge method produces nanotubes with very small dispersion in diameter and high yields. The chirality of the SWNT can be deduced from their radial breathing modes, and it suggests that they are metallic in nature.</p>

Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has been added to Y<sub>2</sub>W<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub> up to 10 wt&#37; in an attempt to overcome the hygroscopicity and reduce the particle size and thereby the thermal expansion hysteresis.

					<p>We report a new nanomaterial in which ciprofloxacin molecules are incorporated inside silica nanobubbles, denoted as ciprofloxacin&#64;SiO<sub>2</sub>. The material has been characterised using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and emission spectroscopy. The material is stable and the freestanding particles can be precipitated and redispersed in several solvents. Confinement of the molecule is complete as leaching through the shell is minimal. The material behaves like free ciprofloxacin in solution; however, effects of confinement are manifested. Energy transfer reaction between ciprofloxacin&#64;SiO<sub>2</sub> and Tb<sup>3+</sup> was monitored by emission spectroscopy. The emission intensity decreased with metal ion exposure indicating selective electronic interaction.</p>

				<title>Heptaphyrins: Expanded porphyrins with seven heterocyclic rings</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0711-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Expanded porphyrins containing seven pyrrole/heterocyclic rings linked in a cyclic fashion are termed heptaphyrins. The number of ùúã-electrons in heptaphyrins depends on the number of <i>meso</i> carbon bridges used to link the heterocyclic rings, accordingly heptaphyrins with 28ùúã-electrons and 30 ùúã-electrons are reported to date. Both condensation reactions of the appropriate precursors and acid-catalysed oxidative coupling reactions have been utilized to synthesise the heptaphyrins. The 30ùúã heptaphyrins exhibit rich structural diversity where some of the heterocyclic rings in the macrocycle undergo a 180&#176; ring flipping. An overview of the synthetic methods employed for the synthesis of heptaphyrins, their spectroscopic properties, structural behaviour and aromatic properties are highlighted in this paper.</p>

				<title>Investigations on geometrical features in induced ordering of collagen by small molecules</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0751-0766</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binding energies of the interaction of collagen like triple helical peptides with a series of polyphenols, viz. gallic acid, catechin, epigallocatechingallate and pentagalloylglucose have been computed using molecular modelling approaches. A correlation of calculated binding energies with the interfacial molecular volumes involved in the interaction is observed. Calculated interface surface areas for the binding of polyphenols with collagen-like triple helical peptides vary in the range of 60-210 √Ö<sup>2</sup> and hydrogen bond lengths vary in the range of 2.7-3.4 √Ö. Interfacial molecular volumes can be calculated from the solvent inaccessible surface areas and hydrogen bond lengths involved in the binding of polyphenols to collagen. Molecular aggregation of collagen in the presence of some polyphenols and chromium (III) salts has been probed experimentally in monolayer systems. The monolayer arrangement of collagen seems to be influenced by the presence of small molecules like formaldehyde, gluteraldehyde, tannic acid and chromium (III) salts. A fractal structure is observed on account of two-dimensional aggregation of collagen induced by tanning species. Atomic force microscopy has been employed to probe the topographic images of two-dimensional aggregation of collagen induced by chromium (III) salts. A case is made that long-range ordering of collagen by molecular species involved in its stabilisation is influenced by molecular geometries involved in its interaction with small molecules.</p>

				<title>Colossal magnetoresistance manganites: A new approach</title>

				<page>0767-0774</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Manganites of the LA$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$MnO<sub>3</sub> family show a variety of new and poorly understood electronic, magnetic and structural effects. Here we outline a new approach recently proposed by us, where we argue that due to strong Jahn-Teller (JT) coupling with phonons the twofold degenerate $e_g$ states at the Mn sites dynamically reorganize themselves into localised, JT polarons $\ell$ with exponentially small inter-site hopping, and band-like, nonpolaronic states ùëè, leading to a <i>new 2-band model for manganites</i> which includes strong Coulomb and Hund‚Äôs couplings. We also discuss some results from a dynamical mean-field theory treatment of the model which explains quantitatively a wide variety of experimental results, including insulator- metal transitions and CMR, in terms of the influence of physical conditions on the relative energies and occupation of the $\ell$ and ùëè states. We argue that this microscopic coexistence of the two types of electronic states, and their relative occupation and spatial correlation is the key to manganite physics.</p>

A wide spectrum of dielectric relaxation was observed in the frequency-dependent response of the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity. Transformation from normal ferroelectric to relaxor behaviour has been observed in the case of the Ca substituting the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> thin films. A number of techniques were exploited to investigate the wide spectrum of relaxation times in pulsed laser ablated thin films. ùëéùëê and $dc$ electric field induced complex dielectric properties of 0.7Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-0.3PbTiO<sub>3</sub> (PMN-PT) thin films were studied as function of frequencies at different temperatures. Nonlinear behaviour of dielectric susceptibility with respect to the amplitude of the ùëéùëê drive was observed at lower temperatures. The frequency dependence of transition temperature $T_m$ (temperature of the maximum of dielectric constant) was studied using the Vogel-Fulcher relation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Partial molar volumes of citric acid and tartaric acid have been determined in water and binary aqueous mixtures of ethanol (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25&#37; by weight of ethanol) at different temperatures and acid concentrations from the solution density measurements. The data have been evaluated by using Masson equation and the obtained parameters have been interpreted in terms of solute-solvent interactions. The partial molar volumes vary with temperature as a power series of temperature. Structure making/breaking capacities of the organic acids have been inferred from the sign of $[\partial^{2} \phi^0_v/ T^2]_p$, i.e. secondderivative of partial molar volume with respect to temperature at constant pressure. Both the organic acids behave as structure breakers in water and water + ethanol.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Excess molar volumes ($V_m^E$) and viscosities (ùúÇ) have been measured as a function of composition for binary liquid mixtures of 1-propanol, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>OH, with diethylene glycol diethyl ether (<i>bis</i>(2-ethoxyethyl)ether), C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, and diethylene glycol dibutyl ether (<i>bis</i>(2-butoxyethyl)ether), C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>, at 288.15, 298.15, and 308.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. The excess volume results included the following mixing quantities at all range of concentrations and at equimolar concentrations: ùõº, volume expansivity; ($\partial V^E_m/\partial T$)$_P$, and ($\partial H^E/\partial P$)$_T$ at 298.15 K. The obtained results were then compared with the calculated values by using the Flory theory of liquid mixtures. The theory predicts the ùõº values rather well, while the calculated values of ($\partial V^E_m/\partial T$)$_P$ and ($\partial H^E/\partial P$)$_T$ show variation with alkyl chain length of the polyether. The results are discussed in terms of order or disorder creation. From the viscosity data, deviations in viscosity (ùõ•  ùúÇ) have been calculated. These values are negative over the entire range of composition. The results for $V^E_m$, and ùõ•  ùúÇ are discussed in terms of interaction between components.</p>

				<title>Anodically generated manganese(III) sulphate for the oxidation of dipeptides in aqueous sulphuric acid medium: A kinetic study</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0049-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetic of oxidation of dipeptides (DP) namely valyl-glycine (Val-Gly), alanyl-glycine (Ala-Gly) and glycyl-glycine (Gly-Gly), by Mn(III) have been studied in the presence of sulphate ions in acid medium at 26&#176;C. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ = 500 nm. A firstorder dependence of the rate on both [Mn(III)]$_o$ and [DP]$_o$ was observed. The rate is independent of the concentration of reduction product, Mn(II) and hydrogen ions. The effects of varying the dielectric constant of the medium and addition of anions such as sulphate, chloride and perchlorate were studied. The activation parameters have been evaluated using Arrhenius and Eyring plots. The oxidation products were isolated and characterized. A mechanism involving the reaction of DP with Mn(III) in the ratelimiting step is suggested. An apparent correlation was noted between the rate of oxidation and the hydrophobicity of these dimers, where increased hyphobicity results in increased rate of oxidation.</p>

					<p>A series of covalently linked bisporphyrins bearing meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and octabromotetraphenylporphyrin (OBTPP) units have been synthesised and characterised. Electrochemical studies on these bisporphyrins showed an anodic shift (‚àº 30-60 mV) of the TPP unit and a cathodic shift (‚àº 40-80 mV) of OBTPP in redox potentials. Further, steady-state fluorescence studies on bisporphyrins indicated dramatic decrease in fluorescence quantum yields of the TPP moiety. Electrochemical redox and fluorescence data seem to suggest the possible existence of intramolecular interactions in these bisporphyrins.</p>

				<title>Molecular orbital studies on the Wagner-Meerwein migration in some acyclic pinacol-pinacolone rearrangements</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0083-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The semi-empirical PM3 SCF-MO method is used to investigate the Wagner-Meerwein migration of various groups during the pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement of some acyclic systems. Pinacol first protonates and dehydrates to form a carbocation that undergoes a 1,2-migration to form a protonated ketone, which then deprotonates to yield the pinacolone product. We study the Wagner-Meerwein migration of hydride, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, phenyl and heterocylic 2-, 3- and 4-pyridyl groups in various acyclic 1,2-diol (pinacol) systems as they rearrange to pinacolones. This 1,2-migration involves a three-centred moiety in the cationic transition state. The migratory aptitude predicted here follows the order: hydride  ùë°-butyl &#62; isopropyl &#62; ethyl &#62; methyl &#62; phenyl, which accords well with available experimental data and/or chemical intuition, reflecting also on the ability of the group involved to carry positive charge in the transition state. The structure of the migrating group (whether aliphatic or aromatic) within the transition state also supports the stabilising role of delocalisation of positive charge for reaction feasibility. Geometrical and thermodynamic considerations coincide in assigning the following order to relative ``earliness‚Äù of the transition state along the reaction pathway: ùë°-butyl &#62; isopropyl &#62; phenyl &#62; methyl &#62; 2-pyridyl &#62; 4-pyridyl.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of eleven amino acids by tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) in aqueous acetic acid results in the formation of the corresponding carbonyl compounds and ammonia. The reaction is first order with respect to TBATB. Michaelis-Menten type kinetics is observed with some of the amino acids while others exhibit second-order dependence. It failed to induce polymerization of acrylonitrile. The effect of solvent composition indicate that the rate of reaction increases with increase in the polarity of the medium. Addition of tetrabutylammonium chloride has no effect on the rate of oxidation. Addition of bromide ion causes decrease in the oxidation rate but only to a limiting value. The reaction is susceptible to both polar and steric effects of the substituents. A suitable mechanism has been proposed.</p>

				<page>0107-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Large pore aluminophosphate-based molecular sieves like AlPO<sub>4</sub>-5, MAPO-5, MnAPO-5 and ZAPO-5 were synthesised hydrothermally using triethylamine as a structure directing agent. These materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), <sup>27</sup>Al and <sup>31</sup>P MAS-NMR, ICP-MS, ùëõ-butylamine- TPD, BET and SEM. The catalytic performance of these materials was tested for isopropylation of benzene with 2-propanol at 250, 300, 350 and 400&#176;C. The products were cumene, ùëù-DIPB (ùëù-diisopropylbenzene) and ùëö-DIPB (ùëö-diisopropylbenzene). MnAPO-5 was found to be more active than the other catalysts. Maximum conversion (20&#37;) was noted at 350&#176;C over MnAPO-5. The selectivity to DIPB was found to decrease with time on stream but the selectivity to cumene showed an increase after 3 h of time on stream.</p>

					<p>The dye-sensitized photopolymerization of N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) in aqueous medium initiated by eosin-ascorbic acid (AH<sub>2</sub>) was studied at 25&#176;C. The polymerization takes place only at higher concentration of AH2 (&#62; 10<sup>-3</sup> mol/L) and its rate increases rapidly as [AH<sub>2</sub>] is increased. The rate of polymerization is proportional to [MBA] and [AH<sub>2</sub>]. Kinetic results indicate that semi-quinone (DH) dye radical and semi-oxidized form (ùê¥) of ascorbic acid are unable to initiate polymerization. Formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is proposed and confirmed. A suitable mechanism is proposed in accordance with experimental results obtained.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Batch equilibration studies are conducted to determine the nature of adsorption of zinc (II) over chitosan. The factors affecting the adsorption process like particle size, contact time, dosage, pH, effects of chloride and nitrate are identified. The influence of temperature and co-ions on the adsorption process is verified. The fraction of adsorption, $Y_t$ and the intraparticle diffusion rate constant, $k_p$ are calculated at different environments and the results are discussed. The nature of adsorption of the zinc (II) - chitosan system is explained using Freundlich, Langmuir isotherms and thermodynamic parameters.</p>

					<p>An O-bonded sulphito complex, Rh(OH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(OSO<sub>2</sub>H)<sup>2+</sup>, is reversibly formed in the stoppedflow time scale when Rh(OH<sub>2</sub>)$_6^{3+}$ and SO<sub>2</sub>/HSO$_3^-$ buffer (1 &#60; pH &#60; 3) are allowed to react.

				<page>0143-0150</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Equilibrium constants are determined for the reaction of ethylester and methyl ester (aquo) cobaloximes with histamine, histidine, glycine and ethyl glycine ester as a function of pH at 25&#176;C, using spectrophotometric technique. The functional dependence of pKa on the substitution rate of H<sub>2</sub>O varies with the p$K_a$ of the incoming ligand, establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. This data is interpreted with the help of kinetic data where dissociation kinetic reactions were also studied as a function of pH. Binding and kinetic data were correlated based on the basicity, steric hindrance of the entering ligand and HSAB principle. To compare the rate constants of the entering ligands pH-independent second-order rate constants were calculated. The effect of incoming ligand on Co-C bond is studied using molecular mechanics.</p>

				<page>0151-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Low-temperature stoichiometric Schiff base reaction in air in 3 : 1 mole ratio between benzaldehyde and triethylenetetramine (trien) in methanol yields a novel tetraaza m-bis(bidentate) acyclic ligand L. It was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, EI mass and NMR (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C) spectra. The formation of a five-membered imidazolidine ring from the ethylenediamine backbone as a spacer-cumbridging unit gives rise to a new type of imidazolidine-bridged ligand. A geometric optimisation was made of the synthesized ligand and its complexes by the method of molecular mechanics (MM2) method in order to establish the stable conformations. This hitherto unknown tetraaza acyclic ligand affords new cationic dicopper(I/I) and dicopper(II/II) complexes in good yield. Dicopper(II/II) complex displays weak ùëë-ùëë transition bands in the visible region, while dicopper(I/I) complex displays strong MLCT band in the same region. Both the dinuclear complexes are of non-intimate nature and show interesting solution electrochemical behaviour. EPR spectral study of ùúá-<i>bis</i>(imidazolidino) bridged dicopper(II/II) complex also supports the non-communicative nature of the two copper centres within the same molecule.</p>

				<page>0159-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A modified template mechanism based on modelling studies of energy minimised complexes is presented for the asymmetric proline-catalysed cyclization of triketones <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> to the $2S$, $3S$-ketols <b>1a</b>, <b>2a</b> and <b>3a</b> respectively. The template model involves a three-point contact as favoured in enzyme-substrate interactions. Our minimisation studies are in agreement with the divergent behaviour of the 6,5-, 6,6- and 6,7-bicyclic systems. They support the high 93.4&#37; ee observed with the 6,5-bicyclic ketol and the lower 73&#37; <i>ee</i> found with the 6,6-bicyclic ketol. The calculations also explain the lack of asymmetric induction with the 6,7-bicyclic system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In an effort to design agents that could solubilize silica in water, under ambient conditions and pH, as takes place in nature, novel zwitterionic, penta-oxo-coordinated silicon compounds with siliconate cores have been prepared from 4-substituted pyridine N-oxides (H, OMe, morpholino, NO<sub>2</sub>) as donor ligands, their structures established by 1H, 13C and MS, and the coordination number of silicon, by <sup>29</sup>Si NMR. The formation of complexes from pyridine N-oxides is noteworthy since they arise from interaction with a weakly nucleophilic oxygen centre. The ability of the pyridine N-oxides to enhance the solubilization of silica in water has been experimentally demonstrated. Possible rationalization of this observation on the basis of O‚ÜíSi coordination via the oxygen atom of pyridine N-oxide is suggested.</p>

				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0187-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To meet the growing demands for the development of new molecular entities for discovering new drugs and materials, organic chemists have started working on many new concepts that can help to assimilate knowledge-based structural diversities more efficiently than ever before. Emulating the basic principles followed by Nature to build its vast repertoire of biomolecules, organic chemists are developing many novel multifunctional building blocks and using them to create `nature-like‚Äô and yet unnatural organic molecules. Sugar amino acids constitute an important class of such polyfunctional scaffolds where the carboxyl, amino and hydroxyl termini provide an excellent opportunity to organic chemists to create structural diversities akin to Nature‚Äôs molecular arsenal. In recent years, sugar amino acids have been used extensively in the area of peptidomimetic studies. Advances made in the area of combinatorial chemistry can provide the necessary technological support for rapid compilations of sugar amino acidbased libraries exploiting the diversities of their carbohydrate frameworks and well-developed solidphase peptide synthesis methods. This perspective article chronicles some of the recent applications of various sugar amino acids, furan amino acids, pyrrole amino acids etc. and many other related building blocks in wide-ranging peptidomimetic studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>new Mannich base, N-(1-morpholinobenzyl) semicarbazide (MBS), formed by the condensation of morpholine, semicarbazide and benzaldehyde, and its Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Zn(II) complexes have been synthesized. Their structures have been elucidated on the basis of analytical, magnetic, electrical conductivity and spectral study as well as elemental analyses. The complexes exhibit square-planar geometry. The monomeric and non-electrolytic nature of the complexes is evidenced by their magnetic susceptibility and low conductance data. The electrochemical property of the ligand and its complexes in acetonitrile solution was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The X-band ESR spectra of the Cu(II) complex in DMSO at 300 and 77 K were recorded and their salient features are reported.</p>

				<title>Basicities of some 9-substituted acridine-4-carboxamides: A density functional theory (DFT) calculation</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0235-0241</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acid-base properties of drugs are important in understanding the behaviour of these compounds under physiological condition. In order to understand such behaviour the proton affinities of acridine 4-carboxamides with substitution (R) at the 9-position are theoretically studied, and considered for the basic sites of both the heterocyclic ring as well as side chain nitrogens. In 9-amino acridine 4-carboxamide, the -NH2 group is observed to be an additional basic site. The heterocyclic nitrogen of substituted carboxamides (R = -NH<sub>2</sub>, -O-methyl, -O-ethyl, and -O-phenyl) is more basic than the side chain nitrogen, however, side chain nitrogen corresponds to more basic site for some carboxamides (R = -OH and -Cl) and the -NH2 group represents the least basic site of 9-amino acridine 4-carboxamide. In addition to presenting the basicities of these drugs an indication of another hydrogen-bond between heterocyclic ring N and carboxamide chain O is observed. The difference of basicities with substituents at 9-position are very narrow and carboxamides with substituents at 9-position are found to be suitable for studying intramolecular H-bonds between the heterocyclic N and carboxamide O. The resultant stabilization of a configuration due to such H-bonding is determined.</p>

				<title>Does an all-sulphur analogue of heptamolybdate exist?</title>

				<page>0251-0259</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The complexes [MoX<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> (M = Mo; X = O or S) exist as the monomeric tetrahedral species in aqueous alkaline solutions. Acidification of tetraoxomolybdate results in the condensation of the tetrahedral units via a series of polyoxomolybdates leading to the ultimate formation of the trioxide MoO3. Heptamolybdate [Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>]<sup>6-</sup> is the first major polyanion of the acidification reaction. In contrast, acidification of tetrathiomolybdates leads to the formation of amorphous molybdenum trisulphide via a dinuclear Mo(V) complex. The formation of the dinuclear Mo(V) complex precludes the formation of any higher nuclearity Mo(VI)-S complexes in aqueous solution. Thus it is shown that the all-sulphur analogue of heptamolybdate [Mo<sub>7</sub>S<sub>2</sub>]<sup>6-</sup> does not exist in alkaline medium and also cannot be isolated from aqueous acidic medium.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Semiempirical (AM1 and PM3) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on about 50 porphyrin isomers with 25 each of 1,2 (<i>syn</i>) and 1,3 (<i>anti</i>) tautomeric forms.

The trends in relative energies are not significantly changed while going from parent system to oxa- and thia-core-modified porphyrins in case of both syn and anti tautomers. Isomers of types [2.2.0.0], [3.0.1.0], [3.1.0.0], and [4.0.0.0] are destabilized due to the absence of methine bridge, which results in angle strain for tetrapyrroles. Isomers having [2.1.1.0], [2.1.0.1], [2.0.2.0] and [2.2.0.0] connectivity, the ùëç isomers, are more stable compared to the corresponding ùê∏ isomers in both <i>syn</i> and <i>anti</i> forms of parent and core-modified analogues.</p>

				<title>Phase transfer of platinum nanoparticles from aqueous to organic solutions using fatty amine molecules</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0293-0300</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this report we demonstrate a simple process based on amine chemistry for the phase transfer of platinum nanoparticles from an aqueous to an organic solution. The phase transfer was accomplished by vigorous shaking of a biphasic mixture of platinum nanoparticles synthesised in an aqueous medium and octadecylamine (ODA) in hexane. During shaking of the biphasic mixture, the aqueous platinum nanoparticles complex via either coordination bond formation or weak covalent interaction with the ODA molecules present in the organic phase. This process renders the nanoparticles sufficiently hydrophobic and dispersible in the organic phase. The ODA-stabilised platinum nanoparticles could be separated out from hexane in the form of a powder that is readily redispersible in weakly polar and nonpolar organic solvents. The ODA-capped platinum nanoparticles show high catalytic activity in hydrogenation reactions and this is demonstrated in the efficient conversion of styrene to ethyl benzene. The nature of binding of the ODA molecules to the platinum nanoparticles surface was characterised by thermogravimetry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).</p>

				<title>Kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of some ùõº-hydroxy acids by hexamethylenetetramine-bromine</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0333-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of lactic acid, mandelic acid and ten monosubstituted mandelic acids by hexamethylenetetramine-bromine (HABR) in glacial acetic acid, leads to the formation of the corresponding oxoacid. The reaction is first order with respect to each of the hydroxy acids and HABR. It is proposed that HABR itself is the reactive oxidizing species. The oxidation of ùõº-deuteriomandelic acid exhibits the presence of a substantial kinetic isotope effect ($k_H/k_D = 5.91$ at 298 K). The rates of oxidation of the substituted mandelic acids show excellent correlation with Brown‚Äôs $\sigma^+$ values. The reaction constants are negative. The oxidation exhibits an extensive cross conjugation between the electron-donating substituent and the reaction centre in the transition state. A mechanism involving transfer of a hydride ion from the acid to the oxidant is postulated.</p>

					<p>The photogalvanic effect has been studied in three systems using photogalvanic cells and NaLS-ascorbic acid-azur A, NaLS-ascorbic acid-azur B, NaLS-ascorbic acid-azur C systems. The photopotential and photocurrent generated by these systems are 770.0, 971.0, 623.0 mV and 160.0, 185.0, 145.0 ùúáA respectively. The effects of different parameters on the electrical outputs of the cell have been observed and current-voltage characteristics of the cell studied, and a mechanism has been proposed for the generation of photocurrent in photogalvanic cells. The conversion efficiencies for azur A, azur B and azur C are 0.5461, 0.9646 and 0.4567&#37; and storage capacity 110, 135 and 95 min respectively.</p>

				<title>NMR of unfolded proteins</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0003-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the post-genomic era, as more and more genome sequences are becoming known and hectic efforts are underway to decode the information content in them, it is becoming increasingly evident that flexibility in proteins plays a crucial role in many of the biological functions. Many proteins have intrinsic disorder either wholly or in specific regions. It appears that this disorder may be important for regulatory functions of the proteins, on the one hand, and may help in directing the folding process to reach the compact native state, on the other. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has over the last two decades emerged as the sole, most powerful technique to help characterize these disordered protein systems. In this review, we first discuss the significance of disorder in proteins and then describe the recent developments in NMR methods for their characterization. A brief description of the results obtained on several disordered proteins is presented at the end.</p>

					<p>Studies on the reaction of some 1,5-ketodiesters/1,5-diketones with NaX (X = Cl/Br/I)/DMSO have shown that under microwave/thermal conditions, facile retro-Michael addition (RMA) reaction takes place instead of formation of the expected Krapcho products. Mechanistic studies have shown that the NaI/DMSO system is a better system than NaCl/DMSO or NaBr/DMSO to promote the RMA pathway and DMSO is an essential requirement.

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0033-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kinetics of ruthenium (III) catalyzed oxidation of atenolol by permanganate in alkaline medium at constant ionic strength of 0.30 mol dm<sup>3</sup> has been studied spectrophotometrically using a rapid kinetic accessory. Reaction between permanganate and atenolol in alkaline medium exhibits 1 : 8 stoichiometry (atenolol : KMnO<sub>4</sub>). The reaction shows first-order dependence on [permanganate] and [ruthenium (III)] and apparently less than unit order on both atenolol and alkali concentrations. Reaction rate decreases with increase in ionic strength and increases with decreasing dielectric constant of the medium. Initial addition of reaction products does not affect the rate significantly. A mechanism involving the formation of a complex between catalyst and substrate has been proposed. The active species of ruthenium (III) is understood as [Ru(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>OH]<sup>2+</sup>. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of mechanism are calculated. Activation parameters with respect to the slow step of the mechanism are computed and discussed and thermodynamic quantities are also calculated.</p>

					<p>Silver nanosized crystallites have been synthesized in aqueous and polyols viz., ethylene glycol and glycerol, using a microwave technique. Dispersions of colloidal silver have been prepared by the reduction of silver nitrate both in the presence and absence of stabilizer poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP). It was observed that PVP is capable of complexing and stabilizing Ag nanoparticles formed through the reduction of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions in water and ethylene glycol. In the case of ethylene glycol, it has been shown that the use of PVP leads to particles with a high degree of stability. The colloids are stable in glycerol for months even in the absence of stabilizer.</p>

				<title>Meso-functionalized octamethoxyporphyrins: A new class of nonasubstituted porphyrins</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0073-0084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Octamethoxyporphyrin containing multiple-donor substituents has been functionalized for the first time. A large number of its mono-meso-substituted derivatives with substituents such as nitro, amino, N-methylamino, formyl, hydroxymethyl, oxime, cyano and carboxy functional groups have been synthesized and characterized. They form a new class of nonasubstituted porphyrins. Crystallographic studies on the cyano derivative show that the -C N group is in conjugation with the prophyrin ùúã-system. The calculated optical transition energies and the electron densities on the imino nitrogens of the synthesised porphyrins using AMI calculations correlate well with the experimentally observed data. Mesosubstituted porphyrins are found to be essentially planar.</p>

				<title>Metal ion coordination in `R‚Äô and `T‚Äô state hybrid hemoglobins as revealed by optical, EPR and sulphhydryl reactivity studies</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0085-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sulphhydryl environment in various mixed-metal hybrid hemoglobins, viz. $\alpha_2$(Cu)-$\beta_2$(FeCO), $\alpha_2$(FeCO)-$\beta_2$(Cu), $\alpha_2$(Cu)-$\beta_2$(Ni), $\alpha_2$(Ni)-$\beta_2$(Cu), was studied by reacting them with the sulphhydryl reagent, 4,4'-dithiodipyridine (4-PDS). The reactivity was compared with that of HbCO, NiHb and CuHb. It is found that there exists a correlation between conformational change and metal ion environment, not only at the extreme R and T states but also the intermediate conformations. EPR examinations of these hybrids show that both in 4R <i>state</i>-[Cu(II)-Fe(II)] and ùëá <i>state</i>-[Cu(II)-Ni(II)] hybrids at neutral pH and in the absence of IHP, CuPPIX, irrespective of the subunit in which it is present, has a mixed-metal ion environment: Species 1, a five-coordinated Cu<sup>2+</sup> complex with strong proximal histidine bond and species 2, a four-coordinated complex without any covalent linkage with NùúÄ F8-histidine.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0099-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a brief review of the syntheses, characterization and anion-binding properties of core-modified octaphyrins is presented. It has been shown that the core-modified octaphyrins exhibit aromaticity both in solution and in solid state, confirming the validity of the (4ùëõ + 2) Huckel rule for larger ùúã-electron systems. Solid-state binding characteristics of TFA anions of two core-modified octaphyrins are also described.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, photophysical and metal ion signalling behaviour of mono- and di-azacrown derivatives of 4-aminophthalimide</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0105-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, photophysical behaviour and metal ion signalling ability of 3-component systems, <b>I</b> and <b>II</b>, comprising a 4-aminophthalimido moiety as <i>fluorophore</i>, a dimethylene <i>spacer</i> and two different azacrown <i>receptors</i>, are reported. The fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes of both the systems have been found to be significantly lower than that of the parent fluorophore indicating the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the terminal moieties. PET is found to be more efficient in <b>II</b>, presumably due to the presence of more than one electron-donating centre in the receptor moiety. Fluorescence decay behaviour of the systems suggests a <i>through-space</i> nature of PET. The systems exhibit <i>off-on</i> fluorescence signalling in the aprotic media in the presence of several metal ions, some of which are well known for their fluorescence quenching abilities. Diazacrown derivative, <b>II</b>, appears to be a somewhat better signalling system than the monoazacrown derivative, <b>I</b>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A novel trinuclear copper(II) compound [{(L<sup>3</sup>)Cu(OClO<sub>3</sub>)}<sub>3</sub>($\mu_3$-OCO<sub>2</sub>)][ClO<sub>4</sub>] has been synthesised using an N-tridentate symmetrical pyridylalkylamine ligand, N-methyl-N,N-<i>bis</i>(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (L<sup>3</sup>). The structure of the complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography; it is found to crystallise in the hexagonal space group $P6_3/_m$ with ùëé = 13.936(2), ùëè = 13.936(2), ùëê = 14.895(3) √Ö, ùõº = ùõΩ = 90$&#176;, ùõæ = 120&#176;. The complex possesses a $\bar{6}$ - symmetry axis passing through the carbon atom of the triply bridging carbonate ion, with the three symmetry related copper ions connected to one another through the oxygen atoms from the bridging carbonato group, giving an equilateral triangular array of copper centres. Each copper ion has distorted square pyramidal environment with the basal plane formed by three nitrogen atoms of the ligand L<sup>3</sup> and the oxygen atom of the bridging carbonato group. The apical position at each copper is provided by the weak oxygen coordination from the perchlorate ion.</p>

				<page>0123-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The binding and photo-induced DNA cleavage activity of a binary complex [CuL<sub>2</sub>](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (<b>1</b>) and the <i>in situ</i> generated ternary complexes [CuLB](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> from <b>1</b> (B: 1,10-phenanthroline, phen, <b>2</b>; dipyrido[3,2-ùëë: 2',3'-ùëì]quinoxaline, dpq, <b>3</b>) are studied, where L is a N<sub>2</sub>S-donor tridentate Schiff base 2-(methylthio)ethylpyridine-2-carbaldimine. Complex <b>1</b>, structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction study, has six-coordinate meridional geometry showing CuN<sub>4</sub>S<sub>2</sub> coordination. The Cu-N bond lengths are in the range of 1.968(3) to 2.158(4) √Ö. The Cu-S bond lengths of 2.599(2) and 2.705(2) √Ö are significantly long indicating weak covalent interaction between copper and sulphur atoms. The thiomethyl groups are <i>cis</i> to each other giving S-Cu-S angle of 75.82(5)&#176;. The Cu-N(pyridyl) bond distances are longer than the Cu-N(imine) bonds. The complexes are redox active and display a quasi-reversible cyclic voltammetric response assignable to the Cu(II)/Cu(I) couple near 0.0 V vs SCE in DMF-Tris buffer (1 : 4 ùë£/ùë£) using 0.1 M KCl as supporting electrolyte. Electronic spectra of the complexes show a ùëë-ùëë band in the range 630 to 700 nm in DMF along with higher energy charge transfer bands. While complex <b>1</b> is a poor binder to DNA, the ternary complexes show good DNA binding propensity. The photo-nuclease activity of <b>1-3</b> is studied using UV and visible wavelengths. The DNA cleavage activity at 365 nm follows the order: <b>3</b> &#62; <b>2</b> &#62; <b>1</b>. The cleavage reaction involves the formation of singlet oxygen as the reactive species in a type-II process.</p>

					<p>Two molecules of a laterally non-symmetric aza cryptand have been attached to 9,10-dimethylanthracene to obtain a multi-receptor fluorescent signalling system in the ``receptor-spacer-fluorophore- spacer-receptor‚Äù format. In the absence of a metal ion, weak fluorescence is observed upon excitation of the anthryl group owing to efficient photo-induced electron transfer (PET) of the lone pair of N attached to the anthryl group. However, when a metal salt is added, the lone pair is engaged, thus in blocking of the PET and leading to recovery of fluorescence to different extents depending upon the nature of the metal ion.</p>

Structures of both complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In both complexes, the N-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)pyrrole-2-aldimine ligand is coordinated to the metal centre, via dissociation of the acidic protons, as a dianionic tridentate N,N,O-donor. The M(L)Cl fragment constitutes an equatorial plane with the metal at the centre and the two PPh3 ligands occupying axial positions. The complexes are diamagnetic (low-spin $d^6$, ùëÜ = 0) and show intense MLCT transitions in the visible region. Cyclic voltammetry of the [M(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)Cl] complexes shows reversible M(III)-M(IV) oxidation near 0.5 V vs SCE and quasi-reversible ligand-centred oxidative response near 1.0 V vs SCE.</p>

				<title>Mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes of dipicolylamine and 1,10-phenanthrolines: The role of diimines in the interaction of the complexes with DNA</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0179-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes of the type [Cu(dipica)(diimine)](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, where dipica is di(2-picolyl)amine and diimine is 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (5,6-dmp), 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (2,9-dmp) or dipyridoquinoxaline (dpq), have been isolated and characterized by analytical and spectral methods. The copper(II) complexes exhibit a broad band in the visible region around 675 nm and axial EPR spectra in acetonitrile glass (77 K) with $g_{||}$ and $A_{||}$ values of ~2.22 and $185 \times 10^{-4}$ cm<sup>-1</sup> respectively, suggesting the presence of a square-based coordination geometry for the CuN<sub>5</sub> chromophore involving strong axial interaction. The interaction of the complexes with CT DNA has been studied using absorption, emission and circular dichroic spectral methods and viscosity measurements. Absorption spectral titrations reveal that the intrinsic DNA binding affinities are dependent upon the nature of the diimine ligand: dpq &#62; 5,6-dmp &#62; phen &#62; 2,9-dmp. This suggests the involvement of the diimine rather than the dipica `face‚Äô of the complexes in DNA binding. An intercalative mode of DNA interaction, which involves the insertion of dpq and to a lesser extent the phen ring of the complexes in between the DNA base pairs, is proposed. However, interestingly, the 5,6-dmp complex is involved in hydrophobic interaction of the 5,6-dmp ring in the grooves of DNA. The large enhancement in the relative viscosity of DNA on binding to the dpq and 5,6-dmp complexes supports the proposed DNA binding modes. Further, remarkably, the 5,6-dmp complex is selective in exhibiting a positive-induced CD band on binding to DNA suggesting the transition of the B form of CT DNA to A-like conformation. The variation in relative emission intensities of DNA-bound ethidium bromide observed upon treatment with the complexes parallels the trend in DNA binding affinities.</p>

				<page>0187-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of ùëö-chloroperbenzoic (ùëö-CPBA) acid with meso-<i>tetrakis</i> (pentafluorophenyl) porphynatoiron(III) chloride (F<sub>20</sub>TPPF$_e$(III)Cl) has been studied in dichloromethane and acetonitrile medium at $25 \pm 1^\circ $C. The reactive intermediates formed in this reaction have been quantitatively trapped by 2,4,6-tri ùë°-butylphenol (TTBP) in both the solvents. It has been observed that the kinetic plots of the formation of TTBP$^\bullet$ radical in dichloromethane are all multiexponential, supporting the formation of more than one reactive intermediate in this solvent. In acetonitrile solvent the formation of TTBP$^\bullet$ radical was however observed to be distinctly single exponential. Different kinds of reactive intermediates are proposed in these two solvents.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Free-base (H<sub>2</sub>L<sup>2</sup>), copper(II) (CuL<sup>2</sup>) and zinc(II) (ZnL<sup>2</sup>) derivatives of a porphyrin-anthraquinone conjugate with an azomethine group separating the two photoactive subunits have been synthesized and characterized by mass (FAB), IR, UV-visible, 1H NMR and ESR spectroscopic techniques and also by cyclic and differential pulse voltammetric methods. Analysis of the data reveals that the spectral and electrochemical properties of the individual chromophoric entities are retained and that there is no specific ùúã-ùúã interaction between the porphyrin and anthraquinone subunits. H<sub>2</sub>L<sup>2</sup> and ZnL<sup>2</sup> are shown to exhibit substantial quenching (88-97&#37;) of the porphyrin fluorescence compared to their corresponding monomeric analogues. An intramolecular electron-transfer mechanism is proposed for the substantial decrease in fluorescence in both derivatives. The fluorescence decays of porphyrin-anthraquinone conjugates are fit to 2/3 exponentials and indicate that multiple orientations of the porphyrin and anthraquinone groups contribute to the electron-transfer event. These results are in good agreement with steady-state fluorescence results. From the time-resolved fluorescence data, the electron-transfer rate constants are calculated, indicating $k_{\text{ET}}$ values in the range of $1.1 \times 10^9$ to $9.9 \times  10^{10}$ s<sup>-1</sup> that are dependent upon the solvent.</p>

				<page>0207-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Underpotential deposition (UPD) of metals is analysed from the perspective of phenomenological and statistical thermodynamic considerations; the parameters influencing the UPD shift have been quantitatively indicated using a general formalism. The manner in which the macroscopic properties pertaining to the depositing ions and solvent dipoles and the nature of the metallic substrate influence the UPD process are highlighted; earlier correlations of the UPD shift with the work function differences are rationalised. Anion-induced phase transitions which manifest as sharp peaks in experimental cyclic voltammograms are discussed using statistical thermodynamic models.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Densities (ùúå) of glycine, L-alanine, and L-valine in aqueous solutions of MgCl<sub>2.6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O (0.1-0.8 mol kg<sup>-1</sup>) have been measured at 288.15, and 308.15 K. Apparent molar volumes ($V_\phi$), and limiting partial molar volumes ($V^0_{\phi}$) of each amino acid have been calculated. These data were combined with the earlier reported $V^0_{\phi}$ values of glycine, L-alanine, and L-valine in aqueous MgCl<sub>2.6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O solutions at 298.15 K in order to describe the temperature dependence behaviour of partial molar quantities. Group contributions to partial molar volumes have been determined for the amino acids. The trends of transfer volumes ($\Delta V^0_{\phi}$) have been interpreted in terms of solute-cosolute interactions on the basis of a cosphere overlap model. Pair and triplet interaction coefficients have also been calculated from transfer parameters.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Viscosities and densities of sucrose in aqueous alkali metal halide solutions of different concentrations in the temperature range 293.15 to 313.15 K have been measured. Partial molar volumes at infinite dilution ($V_2^0$) of sucrose determined from apparent molar volume ($\phi_v$) have been utilized to estimate partial molar volumes of transfer ($V^0_{2,tr}$) for sucrose from water to alkali metal halide solutions. The viscosity data of alkali metal halides in purely aqueous solutions and in the presence of sucrose at different temperatures (293.15, 303.15 and 313.5 K) have been analysed by the Jones-Dole equation. The nature and magnitude of solute-solvent and solute-solute interactions have been discussed in terms of the values of limiting apparent molar volume ($\phi^0_v$), slope ($S_v$) and coefficients of the Jones-Dole equation. The structuremaking and structure-breaking capacities of alkali metal halides in pure aqueous solutions and in the presence of sucrose have been ascertained from temperature dependence of $\phi^0_v$.</p>

				<title>Selenium-containing enzymes in mammals: Chemical perspectives</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0287-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemical and biochemical route to the synthesis of the 21st amino acid in living systems, selenocysteine, is described. The incorporation of this rare amino acid residue into proteins is described with emphasis on the role of monoselenophosphate as selenium source. The role of selenocysteine moiety in natural mammalian enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), iodothyronine deiodinase (ID) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is highlighted and the effect of other amino acid residues located in close proximity to selenocysteine is described. It is evident from various studies that two amino acid residues, tryptophan and glutamine, appear in identical positions in all known members of the GPx family. According to the three-dimensional structure established for bovine GPx, these residues could constitute a catalytic triad in which the selenol group of the selenocysteine is both stabilized and activated by hydrogen bonding with the imino group of the tryptophan (Trp) residue and with the amido group of the glutamine (Gln) residue. The ID enzymes, on the other hand, do not possess any Trp or Gln residues in close proximity to selenium, but contain several histidine residues, which may play important roles in the catalysis. The TrxR enzymes also possess some basic histidines, but the most important amino acid residues are the cysteines which constitute the internal cofactor systems along with the catalytically active selenocysteine. The catalytic activity and substrate specificity of all three selenoenzymes are described. The reactivity of selenocysteine residues in selenoenzymes towards metal-based drugs such as goldthioglucose is also described.</p>

				<title>Electrochemical determination of hydrogen peroxide using ùëú-dianisidine as substrate and hemoglobin as catalyst</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0317-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new electrochemical method for the determination of microamounts of hydrogen peroxide utilizing ùëú-dianisidine (ODA) as substrate and hemoglobin (Hb) as catalyst is described in this paper. Hb can be used as mimetic peroxidase and it can catalyse the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with the subsequent oxidation of ODA. The oxidative reaction product is an azo compound, which is an electroactive substance and has a sensitive second-order derivative polarographic reductive peak at the potential of -0.58 V (vs. SCE) in pH 8.0 Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffer solution. The conditions of Hb-catalytic reaction and polarographic detection of the reaction product were carefully studied. By using this polarographic peak and under optimal conditions, the calibration curve for the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was constructed in the linear range of $2.0 \times 10^{-7} \sim 1.0  \times 10^{-4}$ mol/l with the detection limit of $5.0 \times 10^{-8}$ mol/l. This method can also be used to the determination of Hb content in the range of $2.0  \times 10^{-9} \sim 3.0  \times 10^{-7}$ mol/l with a detection limit of $1.0 \times 10^{-9}$ mol/l. The proposed method was further applied to the determination of the content of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in fresh rainwater with satisfactory results. The catalytic reaction mechanism and the electrode reductive process of the reaction product were carefully studied.</p>

					<p>Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of glycine by iron(III)-1,10-phenanthroline complex has been studied in perchloric acid medium. The reaction is first order with respect to iron(III) and glycine. An increase in (phenanthroline) increases the rate, while increase in [H<sup>+</sup>] decreases the rate. Hence it can be inferred that the reactive species of the substrate is the zwitterionic form and that of the oxidant is [Fe(phen)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>.

				<abstract>
					<p>Chloramphenicol (CAP) is an antibiotic drug having a wide spectrum of activity. The kinetics of oxidation of chloramphenicol by 1-chlorobenzotriazole (CBT) in HClO<sub>4</sub> medium over the temperature range 293-323 K has been investigated. The reaction exhibits first-order kinetics with respect to [CBT]$_o$ and zero-order with respect to [CAP]$_o$. The fractional-order dependence of rate on [H<sup>+</sup>] suggests complex formation between CBT and H<sup>+</sup>. It fails to induce polymerization of acrylonitrile under the experimental conditions employed. Activation parameters are evaluated. The observed solvent isotope effect indicates the absence of hydride transfer during oxidation. Effects of dielectric constant and ionic strength of the medium on the reaction rate have been studied. Oxidation products are identified. A suitable reaction scheme is proposed and an appropriate rate law is deduced to account for the observed kinetic data.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of protection of adenosine from sulphate radical anion and repair of adenosine radicals by caffeic acid in aqueous solution</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0345-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The photooxidation of adenosine in presence of peroxydisulphate (PDS) has been studied by spectrophotometrically measuring the absorbance of adenosine at 260 nm. The rates of oxidation of adenosine by sulphate radical anion have been determined in the presence of different concentrations of caffeic acid. Increase in [caffeic acid] is found to decrease the rate of oxidation of adenosine suggesting that caffeic acid acts as an efficient scavenger of $SO_4^{\bullet-}$ and protects adenosine from it. Sulphate radical anion competes for adenosine as well as for caffeic acid. The quantum yields of photooxidation of adenosine have been calculated from the rates of oxidation of adenosine and the light intensity absorbed by PDS at 254 nm, the wavelength at which PDS is activated to sulphate radical anion. From the results of experimentally determined quantum yields ($\phi_{\text{exptl}}$) and the quantum yields calculated ($\phi_{\text{cal}}$) assuming caffeic acid acting only as a scavenger of $SO_4^{\bullet-}$ show that $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values are lower than $\phi_{\text{cal}}$ values. The ùëì' values, which are experimentally found quantum yield values at each caffeic acid concentration and corrected for $SO_4^{\bullet-}$ scavenging by caffeic acid, are also found to be greater than $\phi_{\text{exptl}}$ values. These observations suggest that the transient adenosine radicals are repaired by caffeic acid in addition to scavenging of sulphate radical anions.</p>

				<title>DFT reactivity indices in confined many-electron atoms</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0379-0386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The density functional descriptors of chemical reactivity given by electronegativity, global hardness and softness are reported for a representative set of spherically confined atoms of IA, IIA, VA and VIIIA series in the periodic table. The atomic electrons are confined within the impenetrable spherical cavity defined by a given radius of confinement satisfying the Dirichlet boundary condition such that the electron density vanishes at the radius of confinement. With this boundary condition the non-relativistic spin-polarized Kohn-Sham equations were solved. The electronegativity in a confined atom is found to decrease as the radius of confinement is reduced suggesting that relative to the free state the atom loses its capacity to attract electrons under confined conditions. While the global hardness of a confined atom increases as the radius of confinement decreases, due to the accompanying orbital energy level crossing, it does not increase infinitely. At a certain confinement radius, the atomic global hardness is even reduced due to such crossover. General trends of the atomic softness parameter under spherically confined conditions are reported and discussed.</p>

				<title>The electron-propagator approach to conceptual density-functional theory</title>

				<page>0387-0400</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both electron propagator theory and density-functional theory provide conceptually useful information about chemical reactivity and, most especially, charge transfer. This paper elucidates thequalitative and quantitative links between the two theories, with emphasis on how the reactivity indicators of conceptual density-functional theory can be derived from electron propagator theory. Electron propagator theory could be used to compute reactivity indices with high accuracy at reasonable computational cost.</p>

				<title>A density functional theory-based chemical potential equalisation approach to molecular polarizability</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0401-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electron density changes in molecular systems in the presence of external electric fields are modeled for simplicity in terms of the induced charges and dipole moments at the individual atomic sites. A chemical potential equalisation scheme is proposed for the calculation of these quantities and hence the dipole polarizability within the framework of density functional theory based linear response theory. The resulting polarizability is expressed in terms of the contributions from individual atoms in the molecule. A few illustrative numerical calculations are shown to predict the molecular polarizabilities in good agreement with available results. The usefulness of the approach to the calculation of intermolecular interaction needed for computer simulation is highlighted.</p>

				<title>Relation between the Fukui function and the Coulomb hole</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>By using a coarse-grain representation of the molecular electronic density, we demonstrate that the value of the condensed Fukui function at an atomic site is directly related to the polarization charge (Coulomb hole) induced by a test electron removed (or added) from (at) the atom. The link between the formation of an electron-hole pair and the condensed Fukui function provides insights on the possible negativity of the Fukui function which is interpreted in terms of two phenomena: overscreening and overstrengthening.</p>

				<title>Condensation of the highest occupied molecular orbital within the electron localization function domains</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0419-0424</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Use of regions of space defined by topological analysis of electron localization function (ELF) as reactivity descriptors is explored. By starting from the fact that the ELF presents high values in the regions where it is most probable to find an electron pair and that the square of the HOMO is a good measure of the reactivity of a molecule, it is proposed that the integration of the square of the HOMO over the volumes defined by the ELF should be a local index for predicting the most nucleophilic site of a molecule. We present here some computational results on simple systems in order to get some insights about this possibility.</p>

				<title>Hardness and excitation energy</title>

				<page>0437-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of the ensemble Kohn-Sham hardness is introduced. It is shown that the first excitation energy can be given by the Kohn-Sham hardness (i.e. the energy difference of the ground-state lowest unoccupied and highest occupied levels) plus an extra term coming from the partial derivative of the ensemble exchange-correlation energy with respect to the weighting factor w in the limit $w  \rightarrow 0$. It is proposed that the first excitation energy can be used as a reactivity index instead of the hardness.</p>

				<title>Electron localization functions and local measures of the covariance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0441-0454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electron localization measure proposed by Becke and Edgecombe is shown to be related to the covariance of the electron pair distribution. Just as with the electron localization function, the local covariance does not seem to be, in and of itself, a useful quantity for elucidating shell structure. A function of the local covariance, however, is useful for this purpose. A different function, based on the hyperbolic tangent, is proposed to elucidate the shell structure encapsulated by the local covariance; this function also seems to work better for the electron localization measure of Becke and Edgecombe. In addition, we propose a different measure for the electron localization that incorporates both the electron localization measure of Becke and Edgecombe and the Laplacian of the electron density; preliminary indications are that this measure is especially good at elucidating the shell structure in valence regions. Methods for evaluating electron localization functions directly from the electron density, without recourse to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ``geometric‚Äù interpretation of the electronic density displacements in the Hilbert space is given and the associated projection-operator partitioning of the hardness and softness operators (kernels) is developed. The eigenvectors |&#198;$\rangle  = \{|\alpha \rangle \}$ of the hardness operator define the complete (identity) projector $ \hat{P} = \sum_\alpha | \alpha \rangle \langle \alpha = 1$ for general density displacements, including the <i>charge-transfer</i> (CT) component, while the eigenvectors $| <b>i</b> \rangle = \{ | i\rangle\}$ of the linear response operator determine the <i>polarizational</i> ùëÉ-projector, $\hat{P}_P = \sum_i | i \rangle\langle i|$. Their difference thus defines the complementary CT-projector: $\hat{P}_{CT} = 1 - \hat{P}_P$. The complete vector space for density displacements can be also spanned by supplementing the ùëÉ-modes with the homogeneous CT-mode. These subspaces separate the integral (normalization) and local aspects of density shifts in molecular systems.</p>

				<title>The reaction force: Three key points along an intrinsic reaction coordinate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0467-0472</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of the reaction force is presented and discussed in detail. For typical processes with energy barriers, it has a universal form which defines three key points along an intrinsic reaction coordinate: the force minimum, zero and maximum. We suggest that the resulting four zones be interpreted as involving preparation of reactants in the first, transition to products in the second and third, and relaxation in the fourth. This general picture is supported by the distinctive patterns of the variations in relevant electronic properties. Two important points that are brought out by the reaction force are that (a) the traditional activation energy comprises two separate contributions, and (b) the transition state corresponds to a balance between the driving and the retarding forces.</p>

					<p>Dynamic behaviors of chemical concepts in density functional theory such as frontier orbitals (HOMO/LUMO), chemical potential, hardness, and electrophilicity index have been investigated in this work in the context of Bohn-Oppenheimer quantum molecular dynamics in association with molecular conformation changes. Exemplary molecular systems like CH$^+_5$ , Cl<sup>-</sup> (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>30</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>15</sub> are studied at 300 K in the gas phase, demonstrating that HOMO is more dynamic than LUMO, chemical potential and hardness often fluctuate concurrently. It is argued that DFT concepts and indices may serve as a good framework to understand molecular conformation changes as well as other dynamic phenomena.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The third term in the Taylor expansion of the total energy functional around the number of electrons ùëÅ is evaluated as the second-order derivative of orbital Kohn-Sham energies with respect to orbital occupancy. Present approach is an extension of an efficient algorithm to compute densityfunctional based orbital reactivity indices. Various energy derivatives used to approximate orbital reactivity indices are defined within the space spanned by the orbital occupation numbers and the Kohn-Sham one-electron energies. The third-order energy functional derivative has to be considered for singular hardness tensor ([ùúÇ]). On the contrary, this term has negligible influence on the reactivity index values for atomic or molecular systems with positively defined hardness tensors. In this context, stability of a system in equilibrium state estimated through the eigenvalues of [h] is discussed. Numerical illustration of the Kohn-Sham energy functional derivatives in orbital resolution up to the third order is shown for benchmark molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>S, and OH<sup>-</sup>.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0507-0514</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the constrained search and Legendre-transform formalisms, one can derive ``generalized‚Äù density-functional theories, in which the fundamental variable is either the electron pair density or the second-order reduced density matrix. In both approaches, the ùëÅ-representability problem is solved by the functional, and the variational principle is with respect to all pair densities (density matrices) that are nonnegative and appropriately normalized. The Legendre-transform formulation provides a lower bound on the constrained-search functional. Noting that experience in density-functional and density-matrix theories suggests that it is easier to approximate functionals than it is to approximate the set of ùëÅ-representable densities sheds some light on the significance of this work.</p>

					<p>The structure and coordination chemistry of boron porphyrin complexes B<sub>2</sub>OX<sub>2</sub> (T$_p$YPP) (X = OH, F; Y = Cl, CH<sub>3</sub>) in connection with its chemical reactivity are analyzed at <i>ab initio</i> density functional theory B3LYP/6-31G<sup>&#8727;</sup> and restricted Hartree-Fock RHF/6-31G<sup>&#8727;</sup> levels of theory. Global reactivity and local selectivity descriptors are used as adequate tools to analyze the isomerism effect (ùëç or ùê∏ isomer) and the substitution effect (X: in axial ligand; or Y: in porphyrin ligand). In all the cases, we find that the ùê∏ conformation is the most stable one, in agreement with X-ray results, and that a principle of maximum hardness in the isomerism analysis is fullfilled. In the substitution analysis, we find that the three global reactivity indexes (ùúÇ, ùúî, ùúí) and the two local reactivity indexes ($f_k$, electrostatic potential) used in this paper predict the same trend when an electron-withdrawing substituent is replaced by an electron donor. Finally, we show that substitution in the porphyrin ligand is slightly more significant than that in the axial ligand.</p>

				<title>Chemical reactivity of hypervalent silicon compounds: The local hard and soft acids and bases principle viewpoint</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0525-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The silicon atom may increase its coordination number to values greater than four, to form pentacoordinated compounds. It has been observed experimentally that, in general, pentacoordinated compounds show greater reactivity than tetracoordinated compounds. In this work, density functional theory is used to calculate the global softness and the condensed softness of the silicon atom for SiH$_n$F$_{4-n}$ and SiH$_n$F$^{1-}_{5-n}$. The values obtained show that the global and condensed softness are greater in the pentacoordinated compounds than in the tetracoordinated compounds, a result that explains the enhanced reactivity. If the results are analysed through a local version of the hard and soft acids and bases principle, it is possible to suggest that in nucleophilic substitution reactions, soft nucleophiles preferably react with SiH$_n$F$^{1-}_{5-n}$, and hard nucleophiles with SiH$_n$F$_{4-n}$.</p>

				<title>Application of localized reactivity index in combination with periodic DFT calculation to rationalize the swelling mechanism of clay type inorganic material</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0533-0539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clays are layered alumino-silicates. Clays swell and expand in aqueous solution. This property governs the usage of these materials in synthesis of nano-composites and is a source of many of its catalytic applications. We used both localized and periodic calculations within the realm of density functional theory (DFT) on a series of monovalent (Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>), and divalent (Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>) cations, to monitor their effect on the swelling of clays. The activity order obtained for the exchangeable cations among all the monovalent and divalent series studied is: Mg<sup>2+</sup> &#62; Ca<sup>2+</sup> &#62; Sr<sup>2+</sup> &#62; Ba<sup>2+</sup> &#62; Cs<sup>+</sup> &#62; Rb<sup>+</sup> &#62; Na<sup>+</sup> &#62; Li<sup>+</sup> &#62; K<sup>+</sup>. We have studied two types of clays, montmorillonite and beidellite, with different surface structures and with/without water using periodic calculations. We have calculated the layer spacing at the first, second and third hydration shells of exchangeable cation, to compare with the experimental ùëë-spacing values to correlate with humidity. A novel quantitative scale is proposed in terms of the intermolecular relative nucleophilicity of the active cation sites in their hydrated state through Fukui functions using hard-soft acid base (HSAB) principle. Finally, a swelling mechanism is proposed. This is a unique study where a combination of periodic and localized calculations has been performed to validate the capability of reactivity index calculations in material designing.</p>

				<page>0541-0548</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Adsorption of small molecules like CH<sub>4</sub>, CO and NH<sub>3</sub> into the acid sites of zeolites is analysed as an interaction between an electrophile and a nucleophile. Global reactivity descriptors like softness and electrophilicity, and local reactivity descriptors like the Fukui function, local softness and local philicity are calculated within density functional as well as Hartree-Fock frameworks using both Mulliken and Hirshfeld population analysis schemes. The HSAB principle and the best electrophilenucleophile combination suggest that the reaction between the NH<sub>3</sub> and Br√∂nsted acid site of the zeolite is the strongest. Interaction between the zeolite and a small probe molecule takes place through the most electrophilic atom of one with the most nucleophilic atom of the other. This result is in conformity with those provided by the frontier orbital theory and the local HSAB principle.</p>

					<p>In earlier work, the present authors have shown that hardness profiles are less dependent on the level of calculation than energy profiles for potential energy surfaces (PESs) having pathological behaviors. At variance with energy profiles, hardness profiles always show the correct number of stationary points. This characteristic has been used to indicate the existence of spurious stationary points on the PESs. In the present work, we apply this methodology to the hydrogen fluoride dimer, a classical difficult case for the density functional theory methods.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The performance of three exchange and correlation density functionals, LDA, BLYP and B3LYP, with four basis sets is tested in three intramolecular hydrogen shift reactions. The best reaction and activation energies come from the hybrid functional B3LYP with triple-ùúÅ basis sets, when they are compared with high-level post-Hartree-Fock results from the literature. For a fixed molecular geometry, the electrophilic Fukui function is computed from a finite difference approximation. Fukui function shows a small dependence with both the exchange and correlation functional and the basis set. Evolution of the Fukui function along the reaction path describes important changes in the basic sites of the corresponding molecules. These results are in agreement with the chemical behavior of those species.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0561-0571</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Regioselectivity of the photochemical [2 + 2] cyclo-addition of triplet carbonyl compounds with a series of ground state electron-rich and electron-poor alkenes, the Paterno-B√ºchi reaction, is studied. Activation barriers for the first step of the triplet reaction are computed in the case of the O-attack. Next, the observed regioselectivity is explained using a series of DFT-based reactivity indices. In the first step, we use the local softness and the local HSAB principle within a softness matching approach, and explain the relative activation barriers of the addition step. In the final step, the regioselectivity is assessed within the framework of spin-polarized conceptual density functional theory, considering response functions of the system's external potential ùë£, number of electrons ùëÅ and spin number $N_s$, being the difference between the number of ùõº and ùõΩ electrons in the spin-polarized system. Although the concept of local spin philicity, introduced recently within this theory, appears less suited to predict the regioselectivity in this reaction, the correct regioselectivity emerges from considering an interaction between the largest values of the generalized Fukui functions $f_{ss}$ on both interacting molecules.</p>

				<page>0573-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>B3LYP/6-31G(ùëë) calculations were performed to obtain all the transition states and products for the 128 distinct reaction channels of Diels-Alder reactions by taking all possible combinations from a series of dienes (1N-a, 1N-b, 2N, 1P-a, 1P-b, 2P, 1O, 1S) and dienophiles (NE, PE, OE, SE, AE, OHE, MeE, CNE). The predictive ability of the values to gauge the regioselectivity of the putative [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions is analysed. No correlation is obtained between the reaction energies and activation energies. The extent of asynchronicity is measured based on the bond order analysis. DFT-based descriptors such as the local softness ($s^+_k$ and $s_k^-$), Fukui function indices ($f^+_k$ and $f_k^-$), global electrophilicity index (ùúî) and local electrophilicity index ($\omega_w$) were found to be better than the conventional FMO predictions.</p>

This present work is focused on the analysis of a molecular system, under the influence of C-PCM induced solvent effect. The analysis is based on reactivity indices derived from DFT. The shift of frequency for diatomic molecules has been obtained. It has been identified as chemical force effect. The role of nuclear reactivity indices has been emphasized.

The condensed Fukui function and the newly introduced condensed atomic descriptor have been calculated for six different systems, namely glycine, alanine, aniline, BH<sub>2</sub>Cl, <i>trans</i>-FC(O)OF and ùëö-anisidine. The individual atomic charges (gross charge) calculated by the MPA scheme have been used to calculate the condensed Fukui functions ($f_k$) and the newly derived condensed atomic descriptors ($sf$)$^{\alpha}_k$ at B1-DZP level of theory. We carried out the calculation using the ``stockholders‚Äù charge partitioning technique (i.e., Hirshfeld population scheme). The newly derived quantity gives the same reactive sites as the condensed Fukui functions, and the complexities associated with the negative Fukui functions are removed.</p>

				<title>A conceptual DFT approach towards analysing toxicity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0599-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The applicability of DFT-based descriptors for the development of toxicological structure-activity relationships is assessed. Emphasis in the present study is on the quality of DFT-based descriptors for the development of toxicological QSARs and, more specifically, on the potential of the electrophilicity concept in predicting toxicity of benzidine derivatives and the series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) expressed in terms of their biological activity data ($pIC_{50}$). First, two benzidine derivatives, which act as electron-donating agents in their interactions with biomolecules are considered. Overall toxicity in general and the most probable site of reactivity in particular are effectively described by the global and local electrophilicity parameters respectively. Interaction of two benzidine derivatives with nucleic acid (NA) bases/selected base pairs is determined using Parr‚Äôs charge transfer formula. The experimental biological activity data ($pIC_{50}$) for the family of PAH, namely polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), polyhalogenated dibenzo-ùëù-dioxins (PHDD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are taken as dependent variables and the HF energy (ùê∏), along with DFT-based global and local descriptors, viz., electrophilicity index (ùúî) and local electrophilic power ($\omega^+$) respectively are taken as independent variables. Fairly good correlation is obtained showing the significance of the selected descriptors in the QSAR on toxins that act as electron acceptors in the presence of biomolecules. Effects of population analysis schemes in the calculation of Fukui functions as well as that of solvation are probed. Similarly, some electron-donor aliphatic amines are studied in the present work. We see that global and local electrophilicities along with the HF energy are adequate in explaining the toxicity of several substances</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fe-Mg-hydrotalcite (Mg/Fe = 3) anionic clay with or without calcination (at 200-800&#176;C) has been used for the benzylation of toluene and other aromatic compounds by benzyl chloride. Hydrotalcite before and after its calcination was characterized for surface area, crystalline phases and basicity. Both the hydrotalcite, particularly after its use in the benzylation reaction, and the catalyst derived from it by its calcination at 200-800&#176;C show high catalytic activity for the benzylation of toluene and other aromatic compounds. The catalytically active species present in the catalyst in its most active form are the chlorides and oxides of iron on the catalyst surface.</p>

					<p>Binding of quercetin to human serum albumin (HSA) was studied and the binding constant measured by following the red-shifted absorption spectrum of quercetin in the presence of HSA and the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence in the presence of different concentrations of quercetin. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of HSA showed decrease in the average lifetimes indicating binding at a location, near the tryptophan moiety, and the possibility of fluorescence energy transfer between excited tryptophan and quercetin. Critical transfer distance ($R_o$) was determined, from which the mean distance between tryptophan-214 in HSA and quercetin was calculated.

				<title>Mechanism of interaction of vincristine sulphate and rifampicin with bovine serum albumin: A spectroscopic study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0649-0655</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanism of interaction of vincristine sulphate (VS) and rifampicin (RF) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been studied by quenching of BSA fluorescence by RF/VS. The Stern-Volmer plot indicates the presence of a static component in the quenching mechanism. Results also show that both the tryptophan residues of BSA are accessible to VS and RF. The high magnitude of rate constant of quenching indicates that the process of energy transfer occurs by intermolecular interaction and VS/RFbinding site is in close proximity to the tryptophan residues of BSA. Binding studies in the presence of a hydrophobic probe, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid sodium salt (ANS) indicate that the VS and RF compete with ANS for hydrophobic sites on the surface of BSA. Small decreases in critical micellar concentrations (CMC) of anionic surfactants in presence of VS/ RF show that the ionic character of VS/RF also contributes to binding. The temperature dependence of the association constant is used to estimate the values of the thermodynamic parameters involved in the interaction of VS/RF with BSA and the results indicate that hydrophobic forces play a significant role in the binding. Circular dichroism studies reveal that the change in helicity of BSA are due to binding of VS/RF to BSA.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Adsorption of ferric ions by chitin was studied by the batch equilibration method. The influence of particle size and dosage of the adsorbant, contact time, initial concentration of the adsorbate and temperature were experimentally verified. The effect of anions like chloride, nitrate and sulphate and also of cations like zinc, chromium and copper on the adsorption of iron(III) was determined. The time dependence of fraction of adsorption, $Y_t$, at varying particle sizes and doses of chitin and the intraparticle diffusion rate constants, $k_p$, of the adsorption process were calculated. Thermodynamic and equilibrium parameters of the reaction were determined to understand the sorption behaviour of chitin. The results revealed that the adsorption of iron(III) by chitin is spontaneous, endothermic and favourable.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We relate in this study the thermal expansivity, $\alpha_P$, to the Raman frequency shift ($1/v$)($\partial v/\partial P$)$_T$ for the rotatory lattice (librational) mode in ammonia solid II near its melting point. We have used our calculated Raman frequencies of this mode for pressures of 3.65, 5.02 and 6.57 kbars for this crystalline system. The values of the slope, d$P_m$/dT, which we deduced from our spectroscopic relation, are compared with those obtained experimentally. In particular, our computed slope value for the pressure of 5.02 kbar is in very good agreement with the empirical result.</p>

In the presence of water vapour, the pyrolysis of organometallic-hydrocarbon mixtures yields single-walled nanotubes, as well as relatively narrow-diameter carbon nanotubes with Y-junctions.

				<page>0015-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Single-domain barium ferrite nano particles have been synthesized with narrow particle-size distribution using an auto combustion technique. In this process, citric acid was used as a fuel. Ratios of cation to fuel were maintained variously at 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. The pH was 7 in all cases. Of all three cases, a cation to citric acid ratio of 1 : 2 gives better yield in the formation of crystalline and single domain particles with a narrow range of size distribution. Most particles are in the range of 80 to 100 nm. Maximum magnetization and coercivity values are also greater for 1 : 2 ratios. These values measured at room temperature are found to be 55 emu/gram and 5000 Oe respectively. XPS and ESR studies support the results.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in chemistry and biology: Non-F√∂rster distance dependence of the FRET rate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0023-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a popular tool to study equilibrium and dynamical properties of polymers and biopolymers in condensed phases and is now widely used in conjunction with single molecule spectroscopy. In the data analysis, one usually employs the F√∂rster expression which predicts ($1/R^6$) distance dependence of the energy transfer rate. However, critical analysis shows that this expression can be of rather limited validity in many cases. We demonstrate this by explicitly considering a donor-acceptor system, polyfluorene (PF<sub>6</sub>)-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP), where the size of both donor and acceptor is comparable to the distance separating them. In such cases, one may expect much weaker distance (as $1/R^2$ or even weaker) dependence. We have also considered the case of energy transfer from a dye to a nanoparticle. Here we find $1/R^4$ distance dependence at large separations, completely different from F√∂rster. We also discuss recent application of FRET to study polymer conformational dynamics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using molten salt route (with NaCl/KCl as the salt) we have been able to synthesize a new form of magnesium tantalate at 850&#176;C. Powder X-ray diffraction data could be indexed on an orthorhombic unit cell with lattice parameters, `ùëé' = 15.36(1) √Ö, ‚Äòùëè‚Äô = 13.38(1) √Ö and ‚Äòùëê‚Äô = 12.10(1) √Ö. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction studies confirm the results obtained by X-ray studies. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy helps ascertain the composition of MgTa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. The title compound shows a dielectric constant of &#8764; 24 with a low dielectric loss of 0.006 at 100 kHz at room temperature. Dielectric constant is nearly unchanged with rise in temperature while the loss shows a very marginal increase (0.007 at 300&#176;C).</p>

				<title>Design and fabrication of an automated temperature programmed reaction system to evaluate 3-way catalysts Ce$_{1-x-y}$(La/Y)$_x$Pt$_y$O$_{2-\delta}$</title>

				<page>0047-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A completely automated temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) system for carrying out gas-solid catalytic reactions under atmospheric flow conditions is fabricated to study CO and hydrocarbon oxidation, and NO reduction. The system consists of an all-stainless steel UHV system, quadrupole mass spectrometer SX200 (VG Scientific), a tubular furnace and micro-reactor, a temperature controller, a versatile gas handling system, and a data acquisition and analysis system. The performance of the system has been tested under standard experimental conditions for CO oxidation over well-characterized Ce$_{1-x-y}$Pt$_x$(La/Y)$_y$O$_{2-\delta}$ catalysts. Testing of 3-way catalysis with CO, NO and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> to convert to CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O is done with this catalyst which shows complete removal of pollutants below 325&#176;C. Fixed oxide-ion defects in Pt substituted Ce$_{1-y}$(La/Y)$_y$O$_{2-y/2}$ show higher catalytic activity than Pt ion-substituted CeO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

					<p>A hydrothermal reaction of a mixture of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, ethylenediamine and water gave rise to a layered poly oxovanadate material [Zn<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>][{Zn(NH<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>2</sub>{V<sub>18</sub>O<sub>42</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)}]$\cdot x$H<sub>2</sub>O (ùë• = 12) (<b>I</b>) consisting of [V<sub>18</sub>O<sub>42</sub>]<sup>12-</sup> clusters. These clusters, with all the vanadium ions in the +4 state, are connected together through Zn(NH<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> linkers forming a two-dimensional structure. The layers are also separated by distorted trigonal bipyramidal [Zn<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>] complexes. The structure, thus, presents a dual role for the Zn-ethylenediamine complex. The magnetic susceptibility studies indicate that the interactions between the V centres in <b>I</b> are predominantly antiferromagnetic in nature and the compound shows highly frustrated behaviour. The magnetic properties are compared to the theoretical calculations based on the Heisenberg model, in addition to correlating to the structure. Crystal data for the complexes are presented.</p>

				<title>A density matrix renormalization group study of low-lying excitations of polythiophene within a Pariser-Parr-Pople model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0067-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Symmetrized density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations have been carried out, within Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian, to explore the nature of the ground and low-lying excited states of long polythiophene oligomers. We have exploited $C_2$ symmetry and spin parity of the system to obtain excited states of experimental interest, and studied the lowest dipole allowed excited state and lowest dipole forbidden two photon state, for different oligomer sizes. In the long system limit, the dipole allowed excited state always lies below the lowest dipole forbidden two-photon state which implies, by Kasha rule, that polythiophene fluoresces strongly. The lowest triplet state lies below two-photon state as usual in conjugated polymers. We have doped the system with a hole and an electron and obtained the charge excitation gap and the binding energy of the $1^1 B_u^-$ exciton. We have calculated the charge density of the ground, one-photon and two-photon states for the longer system size of 10 thiophene rings to characterize these states. We have studied bond order in these states to get an idea about the equilibrium excited state geometry of the system. We have also studied the charge density distribution of the singly and doubly doped polarons for longer system size, and observe that polythiophenes do not support bipolarons.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Disordered Sr<sub>2</sub>FeMoO<sub>6</sub> shows a drastic reduction in saturation magnetization compared to highly ordered samples, moreover magnetization as a function of the temperature for different disordered samples shows qualitatively different behaviours. We investigate the origin of such diversity by performing spatially resolved photoemission spectroscopy on various disordered samples. Our results establish that extensive electronic inhomogeneity, arising most probably from an underlying chemical inhomogeneity in disordered samples, is responsible for the observed magnetic inhomogeneity. It is further pointed out that these inhomogeneities are connected with composition fluctuations of the type Sr<sub>2</sub>Fe$_{1+x}$Mo$_{1-x}$O<sub>6</sub> with Fe-rich (ùë• &#62; 0) and Mo-rich (ùë• &#60; 0) regions.</p>

					<p>Lightweight grids for lead-acid battery grids have been prepared from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) copolymer followed by coating with lead. Subsequently, the grids have been electrochemically coated with a conductive and corrosion-resistant layer of polyaniline. These grids are about 75&#37; lighter than those employed in conventional lead-acid batteries. Commercial-grade 6V/3.5Ah (C<sub>20</sub>-rate) lead-acid batteries have been assembled and characterized employing positive and negative plates constituting these grids. The specific energy of such a lead-acid battery is about 50 Wh/kg. The batteries can withstand fast charge-discharge duty cycles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties of La$_{0.7 -x}$Ce$_x$Ba<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> (ùë• = 0-0.4) have been investigated although some unreacted secondary phases of CeO<sub>2</sub> were present. The rhombohedral structure ($R-3c$) for ùë• = 0 transforms to orthorhombic with the space group <i>Imma</i> for ùë• = 0.3. All samples showed ferromagnetic transition above 300 K and a negative magnetoresistance. For ùë• &#62; 0.1, magnetization data measured at 1 T showed a decrease at low temperatures (ùëá  &#60; 50 K) due to antiferromagnetic coupling between Ce-local moments and Mn-moments. For ùë• = 0.4, the resistivity showed a maximum around 200 K which corresponds to ordering temperature of cerium. Since these results are similar to that observed in the Sr-containing La$_{0.5-x}$Ce$_x$Sr<sub>0.5</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> (ùë• = 0-0.4) system, we suggest that the cerium ions are in the trivalent state and the anomalous behaviour has been attributed to a Kondo-like effect.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The internal surface of an Mg-Al layered double hydroxide has been functionalized by anchoring carboxy-methyl derivatized ùõΩ-cyclodextrin cavities to the gallery walls. Neutral polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been included within the functionalized solid by driving the hydrophobic aromatic molecules from a polar solvent into the less polar interior of the anchored cyclodextrin cavities by a partitioning process. The optical (absorption and emission) properties of the PAH molecules included within the functionalized Mg-Al layered double hydroxide solid are similar to that of dilute solutions of the PAH in non-polar solvents. The unique feature of these hybrid materials is that they are thermally stable over a wide temperature range with their emission properties practically unaltered.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Layered hydroxides crystallize in a hexagonal structure and incorporate a number of different types of structural disorders as an exigency of anisotropic bonding. Structural disorder contributes to the non-uniform broadening of lines in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. Common among the disorders are stacking faults, which broaden the $h0 \ell/0k\ell$ reflections. Interstratification selectively broadens the $00\ell$ reflections and turbostratic disorder broadens the $0k\ell$ reflections. The line broadening caused by structural disorder has to be discounted before estimates of particle size are made by applying the Scherrer formula.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Solid state ionic conductors are important from an industrial viewpoint. A variety of such conductors have been found. In order to understand the reasons for high ionic conductivity in these solids, there have been a number of experimental, theoretical and computational studies in the literature. We provide here a survey of these investigations with focus on what is known and elaborate on issues that still remain unresolved. Conductivity depends on a number of factors such as presence of interstitial sites, ion size, temperature, crystal structure etc. We discuss the recent results from atomistic computer simulations on the dependence of conductivity in NASICONs as a function of composition, temperature, phase change and cation among others. A new potential for modelling of NASICON structure that has been proposed is also discussed.</p>

In complexes (<b>2a-2e</b>) the terminal Mo=S bonds of the MoS$_{4}^{2-}$ unit get hydroxylated and the molybdenum ion is reduced from the starting Mo<sup>VI</sup> in MoS$_{4}^{2-}$ to Mo<sup>IV</sup> in the final product.

				<title>Tuning size and catalytic activity of nano-clusters of cobalt oxide</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0179-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cobalt oxides were prepared by three different methods: (1) by reacting cobalt nitrate with oxalic acid, (2) co-precipitating cobalt nitrate with sodium carbonate, and (3) using sodium dodecyl sulphate as organic surfactant. All three samples were characterized before and after calcination by solvent extraction and the resulting products examined by IR spectroscopy. In the case of method 3, the removal of surfactant was followed by TGA studies. Products from all three methods were identified by XRD. Peaks in low angle XRD indicate the porous nature of the oxides. The morphology of the pores was studied by transmission electron microscopy. Some irregular pore structures were obtained for samples from methods 1 and 2, with an average size of 4-6 nm. Only the product from method 3 using SDS as template showed ordered structure and optimum size, and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller surface areas of the as-prepared, as well as the treated samples, exhibited H3 type hysteresis. The samples from the three methods were used as catalysts in the oxidation reaction of cyclohexane under mild conditions and the catalytic efficiency of the cobalt oxide was comparable with mesoporous cobalt oxides.</p>

				<title>A study on equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange of alkaline earth metals using an inorganic cation exchanger - zirconium titanium phosphate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0185-0189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An advanced inorganic cation exchange material of the class of tetravalent metal acid (TMA) salt, zirconium titanium phosphate (ZTP), has been synthesized by a modified sol-gel technique. ZTP has been characterized by elemental analysis (ICP-AES), thermal analysis (TGA), FTIR and X-ray diffraction studies. The Nernst-Planck equation has been used to study the forward and reverse ion exchange kinetics of Mg (II), Ca (II), Sr (II) and Ba (II) with H (I) at four different temperatures. The mechanism of exchange is particle diffusion, as confirmed by the linear ùúè (dimensionless time parameter) vs ùë° (time) plots. The exchange process is thus controlled by the diffusion within the exchanger particles for the systems studied herein. Further, various kinetic parameters like self-diffusion coefficient ($D_0$), energy of activation ($E_a$) and entropy of activation ($\Delta S^\ast$) have been evaluated under conditions favouring a particle diffusion-controlled mechanism.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Influence of the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>, which is a mild oxidant, on the performance of the thermal cracking of ethane to ethylene in the absence or presence of limited O<sub>2</sub> at different temperatures (750-900&#176;C), space velocities (1500-9000 h<sup>-1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> mole ratios (0-2.0 and 0-0.3 respectively) has been investigated. In both the presence and absence of limited O2, ethane conversion increases markedly because of the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating its beneficial effect on the ethane to ethylene cracking. The increased ethane conversion is, however, not due to the oxidation of ethane to ethylene by CO<sub>2</sub>; the formation of carbon monoxide in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> is found to be very small. It is most probably due to the activation of ethane in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fundamental properties, density (ùúå) and viscosity (ùúÇ), of citric acid (CA) and disodium hydrogen orthophosphate (DSP) at various strengths were obtained at different temperatures. The ùúå and ùúÇ values were used to determine apparent molal volumes and viscosity of systems. The ùúå, $V_\phi$ and ùúÇ values were regressed against molality ùëö for $\rho^0$, $\eta^0$ and $V^0_\phi$f, the limiting constants at infinite dilution ($m \rightarrow 0$) forionic and molecular interactions. The $\rho^0$ and $V^0_\phi$f of aq. acids are higher than those of aq. DSP and the viscosity of DSP is higher than that of aq. CA. Examination of $\rho^0$ and $V^0_\phi$ functions indicates that mutual compositions of CA and DSP counterbalance concentration and temperature effects on pH in bioprocesses.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive study of the electrochemical reduction of ùõΩ-nitrostyrene and the corresponding heterocyclic analogue has been carried out in aprotic media using wax-impregnated carbon paste electrodes. Nitrostyrene exhibits quasi-reversible reduction process in aprotic medium at the waximpregnated carbon paste electrodes as compared to other electrodes reported in the literature. The nitroradical anion couple detected in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate is found to be stable only in aprotic media. Though, as reported, the pharmacological activity related to this nitro radical anion and its therapeutic value are related to the stability of the nitro radical anion, the stability itself depends on the electrode system employed. Added benzoic acid is found to bring about a positive shift in cathodic peak potential.</p>

				<title>Temperature effects on surface activity and application in oxidation of toluene derivatives of CTAB-SDS with KMnO<sub>4</sub></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0281-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ùõæ<sub>cmc</sub> values of CTAB-SDS decrease from 63.67 mN/m at 10&#176;C to 36.38 mN/m at 90&#176;C, slightly lower than those of either CTAB or SDS. Correspondingly, the CMC of CTAB-SDS decreases almost by half. The increase of surface activity of CTAB-SDS can be attributed to the relatively weak electrostatic interaction at high temperature, which is supported by the increase of solubility of CTAB-SDS with rise in temperature. Catalytic effect on oxidation of toluene derivatives with potassium permanganate follows the order CTAB-SDS &#62; SDS &#62; CTAB. This is not caused by the dissociative effect of CTAB-SDS with low surface activity at low temperature, as seen from the fact that almost all oxidative products can be retrieved for different toluene derivatives and surfactants by mimicking the conditions of reaction. In the emulsifications of toluene derivatives at 90&#176;C, the time that turbid water layers of surfactant solutions take to become clear is the same as that of the catalytic effect on oxidation of toluene derivatives. Thus, it can be inferred that surfactants can improve the oxidation yields of toluene derivatives by increasing the contact between two reacting phases.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>My professional research career spanning more than four decades has been largely devoted to synthetic medicinal chemistry (Ciba, Bombay - now Mumbai - 21 years) followed by an equal number of years in process development of drugs, crop protection chemicals (Searle, Bombay) and drugs and speciality chemicals (Recon and Hikal, Bangalore). These efforts have involved several collaborators including many from other institutions and offered multitudinous challenges calling for continuous creativity in industrial setups. I was fortunate to have had a conducive environment to be able to respond to these challenges. I attempt to offer the readers in the ensuing pages a flavour of the excitement that has marked these years.</p>

				<title>Protonation constant of salicylidene (N-benzoyl)glycyl hydrazone and its coordination behaviour towards some bivalent metal ions</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Protonation constant of an unsymmetrical Schiff base, salicylidene(N-benzoyl)glycyl hydrazone (SalBzGH), and formation constants of its complexes have been determined potentiometrically at different temperatures in aqueous dioxane medium. Complexes of SalBzGH with VO(IV), Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) have been prepared. Elemental analyses, pH-metric, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, electronic, IR, ESR, XRD (powder) and NMR studies have been carried out to study the coordination behaviour of SalBzGH toward these metal ions. pH-metric and <sup>1</sup>H NMR studies show the presence of two dissociable protons in the ligand. IR and NMR spectra suggest the tridentate nature of the ligand, coordinating as a uninegative species in the Mn(II) complex and as a dinegative species in all the other complexes. Presence of two different conformers of the ligand at room temperature and stabilization of a single conformer upon complex formation have been established from <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the metal-free ligand, Zn(II) and Hg(II) complexes recorded at 296 K. Electronic and ESR spectra indicate highly distorted tetragonal geometry for VO(IV) and Cu(II) complexes. XRD powder patterns of the Zn(II) complexes are indexed for an orthorhombic crystal system.</p>

					<p>Optical absorption and fluorescence behaviour of two rigorously purified imidazolium ionic liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium <i>bis</i>(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide are studied in the neat condition and in solution. Non-negligible absorption in the UV region with a long tail extending into the visible region is the main feature of the absorption. Excitation wavelength-dependent two-component fluorescence characterizes the emission behaviour of these liquids. That ion association gives rise to the long absorption tail and shifting fluorescence maximum, which appears to be common to most of the imidazolium ionic liquids, is evident from the effect of the conventional solvents.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0341-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we have probed the dynamics of chlorine atom production from the gas phase photodissociation of carbon tetrachloride at 222 and 235 nm. The quantum yield, $\phi^{\ast}$ of Cl<sup>&#8727;</sup> ($^2P_{1/2}$) production has been determined by probing the nascent concentrations of both excited ($^2P_{1/2}$) and ground state (${}^2P_{3/2}$) chlorine atoms by suitable resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) detection schemes. Although at the photolysis wavelengths the absorption of carbon tetrachloride is weak, significant amounts of Cl<sup>&#8727;</sup> are produced. Surprisingly, the quantum yield of Cl<sup>&#8727;</sup> production does not follow the absorption spectrum closely, which gives rise to the possibility of an indirect dissociation mechanism present in CCl<sub>4</sub> along with direct dissociation at these ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>

				<title>Correlation of the isosteric heat of adsorption of organic molecules over zeolites with equalized electronegativity and chemical hardness</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0345-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Considering the direct correlation between charge transfer and heat of adsorption, we have equated the isosteric heat of adsorption ($Q_{st}$) with Nalewajski's charge transfer equation involving equalized electronegativities and chemical hardness given in the literature. The equation is then tested and compared with the experimental heat of adsorption values of organic molecules over zeolites given in the literature with the average percentage deviation of 15.9. Other similar types of equations of charge transfer affinity are also tested. Various semi-empirical equations based on Barrer's approach of the determination of $Q_{st}$ and neural network method have been proposed, tested and compared for the first time.</p>

				<title>A study of substituent effect on the oxidative strengths of sodium salts of N-bromo-arylsulphonamides: Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of D-fructose and D-glucose in alkaline medium</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0351-0359</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>N-Bromo-arylsulphonamides of different oxidizing strengths are used for studying the kinetics of oxidation of D-fructose and D-glucose in aqueous alkaline medium. The results are analysed and compared with those from the sodium salts of N-bromo-benzenesulphonamide and N-bromo-4-methylbenzenesulphonamide. The reactions show zero-order kinetics in [oxidant], fractional order in [Fru/Glu] and nearly first order in [OH<sup>-</sup>]. Rates of oxidation of fructose are higher than those for glucose with the same oxidant. Similarly, $E_a$ values for glucose oxidations are higher than those for fructose. The results are explained by a suitable mechanism and the related rate law is deduced. The effective oxidising species in the reactions of N-bromo-arylsulphonamides is Br<sup>+</sup>. The oxidative strengths of the latter therefore depend on the ease with which Br<sup>+</sup> is released from them. The ease with which Br<sup>+</sup> is released from Nbromo- arylsulphonamides depends on the electron density on the nitrogen atom of the sulphonamide group, which in turn depends on the nature of the substituent on the benzene ring. The validity of the Hammett equation has also been tested for oxidation of both fructose and glucose. Enthalpies and entropies of activations of the oxidations by all the N-bromo-arylsulphonamides correlate well. The effect of substitution on $E_a$ and log ùê¥ of the oxidations is also considered.</p>

				<title>Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic studies of dithia tetraphenylporphine</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0361-0369</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here infrared absorption spectra of dithia tetraphenylporphine and its cation in the 450-1600 and 2900-3400 cm<sup>-1</sup> regions. Most of the allowed IR bands are observed in pairs due to overall $D_{2h}$ point group symmetry of the molecule. The observed bands have been assigned to the porphyrin skeleton and phenyl ring modes. Some weak bands, which are forbidden under $D_{2h}$, also appear in the spectra due to the distortion of the molecule from planarity-caused by the out-of-plane positioned N and S atoms. Increased intensity of some phenyl ring bands compared to free-base tetraphenylporphine is explained on the basis of rotation of phenyl rings towards the mean molecular plane. Contrary to the point group symmetry of cation of dithia tetraphenylporphine, certain bands are observed to be degenerate due to identical bonding arrangements in pyrrole rings of the cation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report the synthesis of stearate functionalized nanobubbles of SiO<sub>2</sub> with a few aniline molecules inside, represented as C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>&#64;SiO<sub>2</sub>&#64;stearate, exhibiting fluorescence with red-shifted emission. Stearic acid functionalization allows the materials to be handled just as free molecules, for dissolution, precipitation, storage etc. The methodology adopted involves adsorption of aniline on the surface of gold nanoparticles with subsequent growth of a silica shell through monolayers, followed by the selective removal of the metal core either using sodium cyanide or by a new reaction involving halocarbons. The material is stable and can be stored for extended periods without loss of fluorescence. Spectroscopic and voltammetric properties of the system were studied in order to understand the interaction of aniline with the shell as well as the monolayer, whilst transmission electron microscopy has been used to study the silica shell.</p>

				<title>Photocleavage of DNA by copper(II) complexes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0443-0453</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemistry of ternary and binary copper(II) complexes showing efficient visible lightinduced DNA cleavage activity is summarized in this article. The role of the metal in photo-induced DNA cleavage reactions is explored by designing complex molecules having a variety of ligands. Ternary copper(II) complexes with amino acid like L-methionone or L-lysine and phenanthroline base are efficient photocleavers of DNA. Complexes of formulation [Cu(L$^n$)(phen)](ClO<sub>4</sub>) with NSO-donor Schiff base (HL$^n$) and NN-donor heterocyclic base 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) show significant cleavage of supercoiled (SC) DNA on exposure to red light at ‚âà 700 nm. The ùëë-ùëë and CT electronic bands of the copper(II) complexes play important roles in DNA cleavage reactions. The mechanistic pathways are found to be dependent on the types of ligands present in the copper(II) complexes and the photo-excitation energy. While UV exposure generally proceeds via a type-II process forming singlet oxygen as the reactive species, red-light exposure leads to DNA cleavage following different mechanistic pathways, viz. type-I, type-II and photo-redox pathways. Ternary copper(II) complexes with phen as DNA binder and Schiff base with a thiomethyl group as photosensitizer, cleave SC DNA to its nicked circular (NC) form in a type-II process in red-light. The binary complex [Cu(dpq)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (dpq, dipyridoquinoxaline) cleaves DNA by photo-redox pathway at 694 nm. The binuclear complex [Cu$^{\text{II}}_2$(RSSR)<sub>2</sub>], where H<sub>2</sub>RSSR is a Schiff base derived from 2-(thioethyl)salicylaldimine, cleaves SC DNA at 632.8 nm (CW He-Ne laser) and 694 nm (ruby laser) involving sulphide (type-I process) and hydroxyl radicals (photo-redox pathway) as the reactive species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Phosphonate ligands, [RPO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, are extremely versatile in the assembly of multi-tin and multi-copper architectures. We have used organostannoxane cores for supporting multi-ferrocene and multi-porphyrin peripheries. The copper-metalated multi-porphyrin compound is an excellent reagent for facile cleavage of DNA, even in the absence of a co-oxidant. Reaction of ùë°-BuPO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub> with Cu(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. 6H<sub>2</sub>O in the presence of 2-pyridylpyrazole (2-Pypz) leads to the synthesis of a decanuclear copper (II) assembly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Heme oxygenase (HO) is the only enzyme in mammals known to catalyse the physiological degradation of unwanted heme into biliverdin, Fe ion and CO. The process involves introduction of the hydroxyl group at one of its <i>meso</i>-positions as the first fundamental step of the heme cleavage process. It was also found that <i>meso</i>-amino heme undergoes similar ring-cleavage process while reacting with dioxygen in presence of pyridine as an axial ligand. The present paper briefly reviews the reactions of model <i>meso</i>-hydroxylated heme and its analogues with dioxygen, and their relevance in the heme degradation process.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The anionic <i>cis</i>-dioxovanadium (V) complex species LVO$^-_2$ of tridentate biprotic dithiocarbazatebased ligands H<sub>2</sub>L (ùëÜ-methyl-3-((5-R-2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl)dithiocabazate, R = H, L = L<sup>1</sup>; and R = Br, L = L<sup>2</sup>) can bind alkali metal ions.

The LVO$^-_2$ moieties here behave like analogues of carboxylate groups and display interesting variations in their binding patterns. It appears that <b>1</b> is a single stranded helicate with LVO$^-_2$ units forming the strands which surround the labile sodium ions occupying positions on the axis. The compounds are stable in water and methanol as solvents, while in aprotic solvents of higher donor strengths, viz. CH<sub>3</sub>CN, DMF and DMSO, they undergo photo-induced reduction when exposed to visible light, yielding green solutions from their initial yellow colour. The putative product is a mixed-oxidation (ùúá-oxo)divanadium (IV/V) species as revealed from EPR, electronic spectroscopy, dynamic <sup>1</sup>H NMR, and redox studies.</p>

				<title>Structural models of vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases and their reactivity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0503-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Vanadium(V) complexes with hydrazone-based ONO and ONN donor ligands that partly model active-site structures of vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases have been reported. On reaction with [VO(acac)<sub>2</sub>] (Hacac = acetylacetone) under nitrogen, these ligands generally provide oxovanadium(IV) complexes [VO(ONO)X] (X = solvent or nothing) and [VO(acac)(ONN)], respectively. Under aerobic conditions, these oxovanadium(IV) species undergo oxidation to give oxovanadium(V), dioxovanadium (V) or ùúá-oxo<i>bis</i>{oxovanadium(V)} species depending upon the nature of the ligand. Anionic and neutral dioxovanadium(V) complexes slowly deoxygenate in methanol to give monooxo complexes [VO(OMe)(MeOH)(ONO)]. The anionic complexes [VO<sub>2</sub>(ONO)]<sup>-</sup> can also be converted in situ on acidification to oxohydroxo complexes [VO(OH)(HONO)]<sup>+</sup> and to peroxo complexes [VO(O<sub>2</sub>)(ONO)]<sup>-</sup>, and thus to the species assumed to be intermediates in the haloperoxidases activity of the enzymes. In the presence of catechol (H<sub>2</sub>cat) and benzohydroxamic acid (H<sub>2</sub>bha), oxovanadium (IV) complexes, [VO (acac)(ONN)] gave mixed-chelate oxovanadium(V) complexes [VO(cat)(ONN)] and [VO(bha)(ONN)] respectively. These complexes are not very stable in solution and slowly convert to the corresponding dioxo species [VO<sub>2</sub>(ONN)] as observed by <sup>51</sup>V NMR and electronic absorption spectroscopic studies.</p>

				<page>0547-0552</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal chalcogenides constitute an important family of functional materials. Subtle changes in shape, size and phase of these materials result in variations in physical properties (e.g. electronic and optical), which can be exploited for various technological applications. Several strategies have evolved recently for controlling shape, size and phase of these materials. This work discusses design and synthesis of single-source molecular precursors for the preparation of metal chalcogenides both in bulk and nano-size regime. Precursors for palladium chalcogenides, indium sulphides and <b>II-VI</b> materials are presented. Synthesis of a variety of palladium(<b>II</b>)/platinum(<b>II</b>) complexes with internally functionalised chalcogenolate ligands, selenocarboxylates; gallium and indium dithiolate complexes and zinc/cadmium/mercury complexes with N,N'-dimethylaminoalkylselenolate ligands and their characterization by NMR and X-ray crystallography are also discussed. Data on thermal behaviour of a few representative complexes, [Pd(SeCOAr)<sub>2</sub>(PR<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], [PdCl(E·¥ñN)(PR<sub>3</sub>)], [InMe<sub>2</sub>(S·¥ñS)], [In(S·¥ñS)<sub>3</sub>] and [M(E(CH<sub>2</sub>)$_n$NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (M = Zn, Cd, Hg; ùëõ = 2 or 3) are presented.</p>

				<title>Activation of peroxyl and molecular oxygen using <i>bis</i>-benzimidazole diamide copper (II) compounds</title>

				<page>0553-0568</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New tetradentate bis-benzimidazole ligands have been synthesized and utilized to prepare copper (II) complexes. Some of these copper (II) complexes have been characterized structurally. The copper (II) in these complexes is found to possess varying geometries. A distorted octahedral geometry is found with a highly unsymmetrical bidentate nitrate group. An unusual polymeric one-dimensional structure is observed where copper (II) is in a distorted square pyramidal geometry with a monodentate nitrate ion, having long Cu-O bond, while a distorted triagonal bipyramidal geometry is found with two carbonyl O atoms and a Cl atom in the equatorial plane, and two benzimidazole imine N atoms occupy the axial position. These compounds are found to activate the cumylperoxyl group, and this has been utilized in the facile oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes, where they act as catalysts with large turnovers. The yields of the respective products vary from 32 to 65&#37;. The role of molecular oxygen has been studied and an attempt has been made to identify the "active copper species‚Äù. Activation of molecular oxygen has also been observed and has been used for oxidative dealkylation of a hindered phenol, producing di-butyl quinones with yields of 20-25&#37; and 10-12 fold catalytic turnover. Dihydroxybenzenes and substituted catechols are also readily oxidized to the corresponding quinones, in oxygen-saturated solvents. Yields of 84&#37; have been observed with 34-fold catalyst turnover, with di-ùë°-butylcatechol. The activity of these copper (II) - <i>bis</i>-benzmidazolediamide compounds is reminiscent of the functioning of copper centres in galactose oxidase, tyrosinase and catechol oxidase.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ground state geometry and electronic structure of M$^{2-}_4$ cluster (M = B, Al, Ga) have been investigated to evaluate their aromatic properties. The calculations are performed by employing the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. It is found that all these three clusters adopt square planar configuration. Results reveal that square planar M$^{2-}_4$ dianion exhibits characteristics of multifold aromaticity with two delocalised ùúã-electrons. In spite of the unstable nature of these dianionic clusters in the gas phase, their interaction with the sodium atoms forms very stable dipyramidal M<sub>4</sub>Na<sub>2</sub> complexes while maintaining their square planar structure and aromaticity.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0579-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three new monocationic molecular hydrogen complexes of ruthenium of the type <i>trans</i>-[RuCl($\eta^2$-H<sub>2</sub>)(PP)<sub>2</sub>][BF<sub>4</sub>] (PP = <i>bis</i>-1,2(diarylphosphino)ethane, aryl = ùëù-fluorobenzyl, benzyl, ùëù-methylbenzyl) have been prepared by protonating the precursor hydride complexes <i>trans</i>-[RuCl(H)(PP)<sub>2</sub>] using HBF$_4.$Et<sub>2</sub>O. These three dihydrogen complexes are quite stable and have been isolated in the solid state. The intact nature of the H-H bond in these derivatives has been established from the short spin-lattice relaxation times ($T_1$, ùëöùë†) and the observation of substantial H, D couplings in the HD isotopomers. The H-H bond distances ($d_{\rm{HH}}$, &#197;) increase from 0.97 to 1.01 &#197; as the electron donor ability of the diphosphine ligand increases from the ùëù-fluorobenzyl to the benzyl to the ùëù-methylbenzyl moiety. These dihydrogen complexes constitute the initial stages of elongation of the H-H bond enroute to its cleavage along the reaction coordinate for the oxidative addition of H<sub>2</sub> to a metal centre.</p>

				<title>Nanostructured metal particle-modified electrodes for electrocatalytic and sensor applications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0593-0600</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanotechnology has become one of the most exciting frontier fields in analytical chemistry. The huge interest in nanomaterials, for example in chemical sensors and catalysis, is driven by their many desirable properties. Although metal is a poor catalyst in bulk form, nanometre-sized particles can exhibit excellent catalytic activity due to their relative high surface area-to-volume ratio and their interface-dominated properties, which significantly differ from those of the bulk material. The integration of metal nanoparticles into thin film of permselective membrane is particularly important for various applications, for example in biological sensing and in electrocatalysis. We have already established different techniques to design permselective membrane-coated chemically modified electrodes with incorporated redox molecules for electrocatalytic, electrochromic and sensor applications. Recently, we have prepared nanostructured platinum and copper (represented M<i>nano</i>, M = Pt and Cu) modified GC/Nafion electrodes (GC/Nf/M<i>nano</i>) and characterized by using AFM, XPS, XRD and electrochemical techniques. The nanostructured M<i>nano</i> modified electrodes were utilized for efficient electrocatalytic selective oxidation of neurotransmitter molecules in the presence of interfering species such as ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). It has been also shown that the modified electrodes could be used as sensors for the detection of submicromolar concentrations of biomolecules with practical applications to real samples such as blood plasma and dopamine hydrochloride injection solution. The GC/Cu<i>nano</i> electrode has been used for catalytic reduction of oxygen.</p>

				<title>Iron(III) complexes of certain tetradentate phenolate ligands as functional models for catechol dioxygenases</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0601-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (CTD) and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCD) are bacterial non-heme iron enzymes, which catalyse the oxidative cleavage of catechols to <i>cis, cis</i>-muconic acids with the incorporation of molecular oxygen via a mechanism involving a high-spin ferric centre. The iron(III) complexes of tripodal phenolate ligands containing N<sub>3</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> donor sets represent the metal binding region of the iron proteins. In our laboratory iron(III) complexes of mono- and bisphenolate ligands have been studied successfully as structural and functional models for the intradiol-cleaving catechol dioxygenase enzymes. The single crystal X-ray crystal structures of four of the complexes have been determined. One of the bis-phenolato complexes contains a FeN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Cl chromophore with a novel trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The Fe-O-C bond angle of 136.1&#176; observed for one of the iron(III) complex of a monophenolate ligand is very similar to that in the enzymes. The importance of the nearby sterically demanding coordinated -NMe<sub>2</sub> group has been established and implies similar stereochemical constraints from the other ligated amino acid moieties in the 3,4-PCD enzymes, the enzyme activity of which is traced to the difference in the equatorial and axial Fe-O(tyrosinate) bonds (Fe-O-C, 133, 148&#176;). The nature of heterocyclic rings of the ligands and the methyl substituents on them regulate the electronic spectral features, Fe<sup>III</sup>/Fe<sup>II</sup> redox potentials and catechol cleavage activity of the complexes. Upon interacting with catecholate anions, two catecholate to iron(III) charge transfer bands appear and the low energy band is similar to that of catechol dioxygenase-substrate complex. Four of the complexes catalyze the oxidative cleavage of H<sub>2</sub>DBC by molecular oxygen to yield intradiol cleavage products. Remarkably, the more basic N-methylimidazole ring in one of the complexes facilitates the rate-determining productreleasing phase of the catalytic reaction. The present study provides support to the novel substrate activation mechanism proposed for the intradiol-cleavage enzymes.</p>

				<title>Thyroid hormone synthesis and anti-thyroid drugs: A bioinorganic chemistry approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0619-0625</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen peroxide, generated by thyroid oxidase enzymes, is a crucial substrate for the thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-catalysed biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid gland. It is believed that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation is a limiting step in thyroid hormone synthesis. Therefore, the control of hydrogen peroxide concentration is one of the possible mechanisms for the inhibition of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis is required for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and this can be achieved by one or more anti-thyroid drugs. The most widely used anti-thyroid drug methimazole (MMI) inhibits the production of thyroid hormones by irreversibly inactivating the enzyme TPO. Our studies show that the replacement of sulphur in MMI by selenium leads to a selone, which exists predominantly in its zwitterionic form. In contrast to the sulphur drug, the selenium analogue (MSeI) reversibly inhibits the peroxidase-catalysed oxidation and iodination reactions. Theoretical studies on MSeI reveal that the selenium atom in this compound carries a large negative charge. The carbon-selenium bond length in MSeI is found to be close to single-bond length. As the selenium atom exhibits a large nucleophilic character, the selenium analogue of MMI may scavenge the hydrogen peroxide present in the thyroid cells, which may lead to a reversible inhibition of thyroid hormone biosynthesis.</p>

					<p>Reactions of IrCl$_3 \cdot x$H<sub>2</sub>O with the ligands, 2-[(phenylamino)phenylazo]pyridine (HL$^{1a}$) and 2-[(ùëù-tolylamino)phenylazo]pyridine (HL$^{1b}$) produce [Ir(L<sup>1</sup>)<sub>2</sub>]Cl (L<sup>1</sup> = L$^{1a}$, [<b>1</b>]Cl and L<sup>1</sup> = L$^{1b}$, [<b>2</b>]Cl) along with many unidentified products. The iridium complexes have been characterized by various techniques such as X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR, cyclic voltammetry and absorption studies. The complex [<b>1</b>]ClO<sub>4</sub> crystallises in triclinic space group. The crystallographic data have been determined. Notably, the Ir-N (azo) lengths are short (av. 1.9875(4) &#197;) as compared to the remaining four Ir-N lengths (av. 2.052(5) &#197;). There is significant degree of ligand backbone conjugation in the coordinated ligands, which result in shortening of the C-N lengths on the other side of the middle phenyl ring and also in lengthening of the diazo (N=N) lengths. The complexes display multiple low energy transitions ranging between 1010 and 450 nm. These are electro active and show three reversible redox responses in the potential range, +1.5 V to -1.5 V. The cathodic potential responses are ascribed as ligand reductions, while the redox process at the anodic potential occurs at a mixed metal-ligand (HOMO) orbital.</p>

The monodentate 4-nba ligands are disposed <i>trans</i> to each other in <b>1</b>, while they adopt a <i>cis</i> orientation in <b>2</b> resulting in different supramolecular structures. Complex 1 exhibits two types of H-bonding interactions namely O-Hùõ¨O and N-Hùõ¨O, while in <b>2</b> three varieties of H-bond, viz. O-Hùõ¨O, N-Hùõ¨O and O-Hùõ¨N are observed.

The organic dication is H-bonded to the chloride anions and the crystal waters with the help of intra- and intermolecular C-H$\cdots$Cl and C-H$\cdots$O interactions, while the chloride anions are linked to the crystal waters via O-H$\cdots$Cl interactions. One of the crystal waters is linked through an intermolecular O-H$\cdots$O bond with another water resulting in the formation of a water dimer. The O-H$\cdots$Cl and O-H$\cdots$O interactions between the chloride anions and water molecules lead to the formation of a five-membered {O<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>} cyclic dichloride containing a water dimer. The five-membered rings are linked into a chain with the aid of a O-H$\cdots$Cl interaction. The organic cations are organised in zigzag fashion on either side of the chain and are further linked to the anionic water chain via weak C-H$\cdot$O and C-H$\cdots$Cl interactions, leading to the supramolecular organisation of the rings into a spiral-like of chain.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Spectroscopic characterization (IR, NMR and electronic spectra) of methyl (ligand) cobaloxime was done, where ligand = pyrazole, dimethyl pyrazole, alanine and alanine methyl ester. The frequency changes in the IR spectra and shifts in the NMR were explained on the basis of basicity of the ligand, steric hindrance, HSAB principle and $d\pi-p\pi$ back-bonding from metal to ligand. Alanine and alanine methyl ester form more stable complexes than pyrazole and dimethyl pyrazole.

				<title>A comparative study of proton transport properties of metal (IV) phosphates</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0035-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>M(IV) phosphates of the class of tetravalent metal acid (TMA) salts where M (IV) = Zr, Ti, Sn has been synthesized by the sol-gel method. These materials have been characterized for elemental analysis (ICP-AES), thermal analysis (TGA, DSC), X-ray analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. Chemical resistivity of these materials has been accessed in acidic, basic and organic solvent media. The protons present in the structural hydroxyl groups indicates good potential for TMA salts to exhibit solid-state proton conduction. The transport properties of these materials has been explored by measuring specific proton conductance at different temperatures in the range of 30-120&#176;C at 10&#176;C intervals, using a Solartron Dataset impedance analyzer (SI 1260) over a frequency range 1 Hz-10 MHz at a signal level below 1 V. Based on the specific conductance data and the Arrhenius plots, a suitable mechanism has been proposed and conductance performance of ZrP, SnP and TiP compared.</p>

				<title>Identification of intermediate species in protein-folding by quantitative analysis of amplitudes in time-domain fluorescence spectroscopy</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0061-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In protein-folding studies it is often required to differentiate a system with only two-states, namely the native (N) and unfolded (U) forms of the protein present at any condition of the solvent, from a situation wherein intermediate state(s) could also be present. This differentiation of a two-state from a multi-state structural transition is non-trivial when studied by the several steady-state spectroscopic methods that are popular in protein-folding studies. In contrast to the steady-state methods, time-resolved fluorescence has the capability to reveal the presence of heterogeneity of structural forms due to the `fingerprint‚Äô nature of fluorescence lifetimes of various forms. In this work, we establish this method by quantitative analysis of amplitudes associated with fluorescence lifetimes in multiexponential decays. First, we show that we can estimate, accurately, the relative population of species from two-component mixtures of non-interacting molecules such as fluorescent dyes, peptides and proteins. Subsequently, we demonstrate, by analysing the amplitudes of fluorescence lifetimes which are controlled by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), that the equilibrium folding-unfolding transition of the small singledomain protein barstar is not a two-step process.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophan in human serum albumin to a bioactive indoloquinolizine system</title>

				<page>0077-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction between a bioactive molecule, 3-acetyl-4-oxo-6,7-dihydro-12H indolo-[2,3-a] quinolizine (AODIQ), with human serum albumin (HSA) has been studied using steady-state absorption and fluorescence techniques. A 1 : 1 complex formation has been established and the binding constant (ùêæ) and free energy change for the process have been reported. The AODIQ-HSA complex results in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the tryptophan moiety of HSA to the probe. The critical energy-transfer distance ($R_0$) for FRET and the Stern-Volmer constant ($K_{sv}$) for the fluorescence quenching of the donor in the presence of the acceptor have been determined. Importantly, $K_{SV}$ has been shown to be equal to the binding constant itself, implying that the fluorescence quenching arises only from the FRET process. The study suggests that the donor and the acceptor are bound to the same protein at different locations but within the quenching distance.</p>

				<title>Effects of polar protic solvents on dual emissions of 3-hydroxychromones</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0083-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>3-Hydroxychromones (3HC), exhibit dual emissions highly sensitive to solvent properties due to excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Therefore, 3HCs find wide applications as fluorescence probes in biological systems. Here, it is particularly important to understand the fluorescence behaviour of 3HCs in polar environments. Herein, we studied 3-hydroxyflavone, 2-(2-furyl)-3-hydroxychromone and 2-(2-benzofuryl)-3-hydroxychromone in high polarity solvents characterized by different H-bond donor abilities, donor concentrations and acceptor abilities. Our results show that the dual emissions of the dyes are insensitive to solvent basicity but strongly depend on the two other parameters. Moreover, furyl- and benzofuryl-substituted dyes were significantly more sensitive than the 3-hydroxyflavone to H-bond donor ability, while all three dyes showed roughly equivalent high sensitivity to H-bond donor concentration. These results can be explained by different mechanisms. Thus, the sensitivity of all three dyes to increasing concentrations of H-bond donors probably results from increase in the population of solvated dye with disrupted intramolecular H-bonds. Meantime, the sensitivity to Hbond donor ability of the solvent, observed mainly with furyl and benzofuryl dyes, is probably related to the strength of the H-bonds between the solvent and the 4-carbonyl group of the dye with intact intramolecular H-bonds. The present results provide new insights for further applications of 3HC derivatives as environment-sensitive probes and labels of biological molecules.</p>

				<title>Ratiometric fluorescence signalling of fluoride ions by an amidophthalimide derivative</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0091-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence behaviour of 4-benzoylamido-N-methylphthalimide (<b>1</b>), designed and developed for selective detection of fluoride ions, is reported. <b>1</b> displays $F^-$-induced colour change that allows its detection with the naked eye. The $F^-$ specificity of the sensor system is evident from the fact that unlike $F^-$, other halides do not affect the absorption characteristics of <b>1</b>. Apart from the colorimetric response, the fluorescence output of <b>1</b> is also modulated by $F^-$ in a manner that permits ratiometric fluorescence signalling of $F^-$ as well. It is found that the system can detect $F^-$ in the concentration range of $10^-$ 60 ùúáM. The results of the experiments and theoretical calculations unambiguously suggest that the changes of the electronic absorption and fluorescence behaviour of <b>1</b>, which have been exploited for signalling purpose, are due to $F^-$-induced deprotonation of the 4-amido moiety of the sensor system.</p>

The most interesting feature of our experiment was that we observed an increase in solvent relaxation time with increase in ùëÖ (ùëÖ = tween 20-to-[bmim][PF<sub>6</sub>] molar ratio). This is due to the fact that with increase in [bmim][PF<sub>6</sub>] content of the microemulsions, the microviscosity of the pool of the microemulsions increases, and motion of ions of [bmim][PF<sub>6</sub>] is hindered in the pool of microemulsions. Since motion of ions is responsible for solvation in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), solvent-relaxation time increases with increase in ùëÖ.</p>

				<title>On the origin of the anomalous ultraslow solvation dynamics in heterogeneous environments</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0113-0121</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many recent experimental studies have reported a surprising ultraslow component (even &#62;10 ns) in the solvation dynamics of a polar probe in an organized assembly, the origin of which is not understood at present. Here we propose two molecular mechanisms in explanation. The first one involves the motion of the `buried water‚Äô molecules (both translation and rotation), accompanied by cooperative relaxation (‚Äòlocal melting‚Äô) of several surfactant chains. An estimate of the time is obtained by using an effective Rouse chain model of chain dynamics, coupled with a mean first passage time calculation. The second explanation invokes self-diffusion of the (di)polar probe <i>itself</i> from a less polar to a more polar region. This may also involve cooperative motion of the surfactant chains in the hydrophobic core, if the probe has a sizeable distribution inside the core prior to excitation, or escape of the probe to the bulk from the surface of the self-assembly. The second mechanism should result in the <i>narrowing of the full width of the emission spectrum with time</i>, which has indeed been observed in recent experiments. It is argued that both the mechanisms may give rise to an ultraslow time constant and may be applicable to different experimental situations. The effectiveness of solvation as a dynamical probe in such complex systems has been discussed.</p>

				<title>Time-resolved fluorescence analysis of the mobile flavin cofactor in ùëù-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0123-0133</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Conformational heterogeneity of the FAD cofactor in ùëù-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) was investigated with time-resolved polarized flavin fluorescence. For binary enzyme/substrate (analogue) complexes of wild-type PHBH and Tyr222 mutants, crystallographic studies have revealed two distinct flavin conformations; the `in‚Äô conformation with the isoalloxazine ring located in the active site, and the `out‚Äô conformation with the isoalloxazine ring disposed towards the protein surface. Fluorescence-lifetime analysis of these complexes revealed similar lifetime distributions for the `in‚Äô and `out‚Äô conformations. The reason for this is twofold. First, the active site of PHBH contains various potential fluorescence-quenching sites close to the flavin. Fluorescence analysis of uncomplexed PHBH Y222V and Y222A showed that Tyr222 is responsible for picosecond fluorescence quenching free enzyme. In addition, other potential quenching sites, including a tryptophan and two tyrosines involved in substrate binding, are located nearby. Since the shortest distance between these quenching sites and the isoalloxazine ring differs only little on average, these aromatic residues are likely to contribute to fluorescence quenching. Second, the effect of flavin conformation on the fluorescence lifetime distribution is blurred by binding of the aromatic substrates: saturation with aromatic substrates induces highly efficient fluorescence quenching. The flavin conformation is therefore only reflected in the small relative contributions of the longer lifetimes.</p>

				<title>Wavelength-selective fluorescence in ion channels formed by gramicidin A in membranes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0135-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gramicidins are linear peptides that form ion channels that are specific for monovalent cations in membranes. The tryptophan residues in the gramicidin channel play a crucial role in the organization and function of the channel. The natural mixture of gramicidins, denoted as gramicidin A', consists of mostly gramicidin A, but also contains gramicidins B, C and D as minor components. We have previously shown that the tryptophan residues in ion channels formed by the naturally occurring peptide, gramicidin A', display wavelength-dependent fluorescence characteristics due to the motionally restricted environment in which they are localized. In order to check the influence of ground-state heterogeneity in the observed wavelength-selective fluorescence of gramicidin A' in membranes, we performed similar experiments with pure gramicidin A in model membranes. Our results show that the observed wavelength-selective fluorescence characteristics of naturally occurring gramicidin A' are not due to groundstate heterogeneity.</p>

				<title>Employing the fluorescence anisotropy and quenching kinetics of tryptophan to hunt for residual structures in denatured proteins</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0141-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Residual structures in denatured proteins have acquired importance in recent years owing to their role as protein-folding initiation sites. Locating these structures in proteins has proved quite formidable, requiring techniques like NMR. Here in this report, we take advantage of the ubiquitous presence of tryptophan residues in residual structures to hunt for their presence using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. The surface accessibility and rotational dynamics of tryptophan in putative residual structures among ten different proteins, namely glucagon, melittin, subtilisin carlsberg, myelin basic protein, ribonuclease T<sub>1</sub>, human serum albumin, barstar mutant, bovine serum albumin, lysozyme and Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub> peptide, was studied using steady state fluorescence quenching and anisotropy, respectively. Five proteins, namely ribonuclease T<sub>1</sub>, bovine serum albumin, melittin, barstar and hen egg white lysozyme appear likely to possess tryptophan(s) in hydrophobic clusters based on their reduced bimolecular quenching rates and higher steady-state anisotropy in proportion to their chain length. We also show that the fluorescence emission maximum of tryptophan is insensitive to the presence of residual structures.</p>

				<title>A concise review of dynamical processes in polymorphic environments of a block copolymer: Rotational diffusion and photoisomerization</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0147-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes our ongoing efforts to understand dynamical processes such as rotational diffusion and photoisomerization in polymorphic environments of a block copolymer. The objective is to explore how the typical properties of a block copolymer solution such as critical micelle temperature (CMT) and temperature-induced sol-gel transition influence the rotational diffusion of hydrophobic solute molecules. Rotational diffusion of solute molecules differs significantly below and above the CMT of a block copolymer solution, while there is no influence of sol-gel transition on solute rotation. This is rationalized on the basis of the site of solubilization of the solute molecules which is the palisade layer of the micelles in both phases and unaffected by gelation. A similar result has been obtained in case of photoisomerization studies carried out with a carbocyanine derivative in the sol and gel phases of the block copolymer. The isomerization studies have been extended to the reverse phases (sol and gel phases) of the block copolymer to explore the nature of the water present in the cores of the reverse micelles. Our results provide evidence for the existence of water droplets with properties resembling bulk water. In essence, we show that despite having vastly differing bulk properties, both the solution and gel phases (normal as well as reverse) offer identical microscopic environment.</p>

				<title>Fluorescence anisotropy of acridinedione dyes in glycerol: Prolate model of ellipsoid</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0161-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-dependent reorientations of resorcinol-based acridinidione (ADR) dyes in glycerol were studied using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies. The difference between fluorescence anisotropy decays recorded at 460 nm when exciting at 250 nm and those obtained when exciting at 394 nm are reported. When exciting at 394 nm, the fluorescence anisotropy decay is bi-exponential, while on exciting at 250 nm a mono-exponential fluorescence anisotropy decay is observed. We interpret this in terms of different directions of the absorption dipole at 394 and 250 nm with the emission dipole respectively, which is experimentally validated and further analysed as a prolate model of ellipsoid.</p>

				<title>Effect of sodium deoxycholate and sodium cholate on DPPC vesicles: A fluorescence anisotropy study with diphenylhexatriene</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0169-0174</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of two bile salts, namely sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) and sodium cholate (NaC), on DPPC small unilamellar vesicles have been investigated using the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy ($r_{ss}$) of diphenylhexatriene (DPH) as a tool. It was found that the variation of $r_{ss}$ is sensitive enough to monitor different stages of interaction of bile salts with DPPC vesicles. NaDC induced significant changes in the membrane well below its CMC (6 mM). Even at 4 mM, which is still lower than the CMC, the phospholipids were completely solubilised by the NaDC micelles. The effect of NaC on DPPC vesicles, however, was much less significant, especially in the sub-micellar concentration regime. Being more hydrophilic NaC does not interact with the membrane efficiently. Complete solubilisation of phospholipids took place only when the concentration of NaC was above its CMC (16 mM). The experiments also showed that the bile salt-induced changes of vesicle structure were strongly dependent on the concentration of the bile salt and not on the molar ratio of lipid and bile salt.</p>

				<title>Comparative photophysical behaviour of naphthalene-linked crown ethers and aza crown ethers of varying cavity dimensions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0175-0183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative time-resolved emission studies of several naphtho-crown ethers <b>I-V</b>, where metal ions can be complexed in a predetermined orientation with respect to the naphthalene (Naph) ùúã- plane and naphthalene-linked aza crown ethers (L1 and L2) have been presented. In both the systems, crown ethers and aza crown ethers, naphthalene fluorescence gets quenched. In the systems <b>I</b> to <b>V</b>, the quenching is mainly due to efficient spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leading to greater population of the lowest triplet state of naphthalene. This SOC depends on the orientation of the crown ring with respect to the Naph-ùúã-plane. However, in the systems L1 and L2, the quenching is due to photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from nitrogen lone pair of the aza crown ring to naphthalene moiety and consequent exciplex formation. The results have been interpreted using the time-resolved emission studies of all the compounds in various solvents, their alkali metal ion complexes, and protonated ligands.</p>

				<title>Effect of surfactants on the fluorescence spectra of water-soluble MEHPPV derivatives having grafted polyelectrolyte chains</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0185-0193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Poly(2-methoxy-5-[2'-ethylhexyoxy]-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEHPPV) derivatives with polyacrylic acid (PAA) chains grafted onto their backbone were found to be water soluble, and they exhibited a dramatic increase in their fluorescence intensity in the presence of a variety of surfactants, even at concentrations far below their critical micelle concentrations (CMC). This increase was accompanied by a blue-shift in the emission maximum. These observations are rationalized based on the postulate that the backbone conformation of the conjugated polymer is modulated upon interaction of the surfactant molecules with the polyelectrolytic tethers, which in turn results in a significant depletion of intra-chain interchromophore interactions that are known to cause red-shifted emission bands with significantly lower emission yields.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoinduced intramolecular charge-transfer reactions in 4-amino-3-methyl benzoic acid methyl ester (AMBME) have been investigated spectroscopically. AMBME, with its weak charge donor primary amino group, shows dual emission in polar solvents. Absorption and emission measurements in the condensed phase support the premise that the short wavelength emission band corresponds to local emission and the long wavelength emission band to the charge transfer emission. Laser-induced fluorescence excitation spectra show the presence of two low-energy conformers in jet-cooled molecular beams. Theoretical calculations using density functional theory help to determine structure, vibrational modes, potential energy surface, transition energy and oscillator strength for correlating experimental findings with theoretical results.</p>

					<p>Dynamics of interfacial electron transfer (ET) in ruthenium polypyridyl complex [{bis-(2,2'-bpy)-(4-[2-(4'-methyl-[2,2']bipyridinyl-4-yl)-vinyl]-benzene-1,2-diol)}ruthenium(II) hexafluorophosphate] (Ru-cat) and 5,10,15-<i>tris</i> phenyl-20-(3,4-dihydroxy benzene) porphyrin (TPP-cat)-sensitized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles have been investigated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopic detection in the visible and near-infrared region. We have observed that both Ru-cat and TPP-cat are coupled strongly with the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles through their pendant catechol moieties. We have observed a single exponential and pulse-width limited (&#60; 100 fs) electron injection from nonthermalized-excited states of Ru-complex. Here electron injection competes with the singlet-triplet manifold relaxation due to strong coupling of catecholate binding, which is a unique observation.</p>
					<p>Optical absorption measurements indicate that the catechol moiety interacts with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles showing the characteristic pure catechol-TiO<sub>2</sub> charge-transfer (CT) band in the visible region. Transient absorption studies on TPP-cat/TiO<sub>2</sub> system exciting both the Soret band at 400 nm and the Q-band at 800 nm have been carried out to determine excitation wavelength-dependence on ET dynamics. The reaction channel for the electron-injection process has been found to be different for both the excitation wavelengths. Excitation at 800 nm, is found directly populate directly the excited CT state from where diffusion of electrons into the conduction band takes place. On the other hand, excitation at 400 nm light excites both the CT band of cat-TiO<sub>2</sub> and also Soret band of TPP-cat.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The design and synthesis of figure-eight macrocycles are very scarce owing to the intricacies and lack of predictability from first principles. This review emphasizes on discrete macrocyclic systems both synthetic and natural with a defined figure eight knotted topology. In almost all the helical macrocycles, the helical arrangement is held by intramolecular hydrogen bonding or as a backbone requirement, but in all cases, a planar graph can be drawn and so these compounds are trivial from the topological stand point. Nature presents great deal of complexity in terms of structures in macromolecules like DNA and proteins and also displays intriguing topology in simple natural products. Patellamide, tawicyclamides, nosiheptide and thiostrepton are natural products with figure eight topology which shows interesting biological activity. Expanded porphyrins, Cu(II) complexes of thiomacrocycles, cyclic peptides and oligoesters are synthetic macrocycles showing intriguing topology. Analysis of structure and folding behaviour will enable chemists to design molecules with intriguing topology.</p>

In the centrosymmetric dimer <b>1</b>, each Mg atom is coordinated to an aquo ligand, two monodentate N-MeIm ligands and a monodentate 4-nba ligand. The second 4-nba ligand functions as a bridging bidentate ligand, linking the metal centers and completes the hexacoordination around each Mg(II). The dimeric molecules of <b>1</b> are linked into a one-dimensional chain along ùëè with the aid of intra- as well as intermolecular H-bonding interactions between the coordinated water and the free oxygen atom of the monodentate 4-nba ligand. In the mononuclear complex [Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>](4-nba)<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O <b>2</b>, the Mg(II) is located on an inversion center and its structure consists of an octahedral [Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> dication, a free uncoordinated 4-nba anion and a lattice water molecule. One of the H atoms attached of the lattice water is disordered over two positions. The hexaaquomagnesium(II) dication, the 4-nba anion and the lattice water molecule are linked by intra- and intermolecular H-bonding interactions resulting in the formation of alternating layers of [Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> dications and 4-nba anions in the crystallographic $bc$ plane. The lattice water molecules are situated between the cations, while the 4-nba anions are arranged antiparallel to each other along ùëè.</p>

				<title>Isomerization of ùõΩ-carotene by titanium tetrachloride catalyst</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0253-0258</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isomerization of all-<i>trans</i>-ùõΩ-carotene occurs during shaking with 0.5&#37; of titanium tetrachloride catalyst in methylene chloride at room temperature. In the present study we compared two types of columns C18 and C30 and various solvent systems for the separation of ùõΩ-carotene and its <i>cis</i> isomers by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that ùõΩ-carotene isomers were resolved by employing a C30 column with a mobile phase of methanol (100&#37;) (A) and methylene chloride (100&#37;) (B) under a gradient elution condition. A total of eleven <i>cis</i> isomers and one all-<i>trans</i>-ùõΩ-carotene isomer were resolved within 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and detection wave-length of 470 nm.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0277-0282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The collision-free, room temperature gas-phase photodissociation dynamics of CH<sub>3</sub>CFCl<sub>2</sub> (HCFC-141b) was studied using Lyman-ùõº laser radiation (121.6 nm) by the laser photolysis/laserinduced fluorescence `pump/probe‚Äô technique. Lyman-ùõº radiation was used both to photodissociate the parent molecule and to detect the nascent H atom products via ($2p^2$P ‚Üí $1s^2$S) laser-induced fluorescence. Absolute H atom quantum yield, $\phi_H = (0.39 \pm 0.09)$ was determined by calibration method in which CH<sub>4</sub> photolysis at 121.6 nm was used as a reference source of well-defined H atom concentrations. The line shapes of the measured H atom Doppler profiles indicate a Gaussian velocity distribution suggesting the presence of indirect H atom formation pathways in the Lyman-ùõº photodissociation of CH<sub>3</sub>CFCl<sub>2</sub>. The average kinetic energy of H atoms calculated from Doppler profiles was found to be $E_{\text{T(lab)}} = (50 \pm  3)$ kJ/mol. The nearly statistical translational energy together with the observed Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution indicates that for CH<sub>3</sub>CFCl<sub>2</sub> the H atom forming dissociation process comes closer to the statistical limit.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new series of transition metal complexes of Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), VO(IV), Hg(II) and Cd(II) have been synthesized from the Schiff base (L) derived from 4-aminoantipyrine, 3-hydroxy-4-nitrobenzaldehyde and ùëú-phenylenediamine. Structural features were obtained from their elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance, mass, IR, UV-Vis, <sup>1</sup>H NMR and ESR spectral studies. The data show that these complexes have composition of ML type. The UV-Vis, magnetic susceptibility and ESR spectral data of the complexes suggest a square-planar geometry around the central metal ion except VO(IV) complex which has square-pyramidal geometry. The redox behaviour of copper and vanadyl complexes was studied by cyclic voltammetry. Antimicrobial screening tests gave good results in the presence of metal ion in the ligand system. The nuclease activity of the above metal complexes shows that Cu, Ni and Co complexes cleave DNA through redox chemistry whereas other complexes are not effective.</p>

					<p>The di- and trialkyltin(IV) complexes of composition R<sub>2</sub>SnCl$_{2-x}$(OAr), and ùëõ-Bu<sub>3</sub>Sn(OAr) (R = ùëõ-Bu and Me; ùë• = 1 and 2; OAr = OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Bu$^t$-2-Me-4) have been synthesized by the reactions of di-n-butyl and dimethyltin dichlorides and tri-n-butyltin(IV) chloride with 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol and triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction of triphenyltin chloride with trimethylsilyl-2-t-butyl-4-methylphenoxide in the same solvent however, gives a complex of composition Ph<sub>3</sub>Sn(OAr). The complexes have been characterized by microanalyses, molar conductance measurements, molecular weight determinations and IR and <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C and <sub>119</sub>Sn NMR and mass spectral studies. Thermal behaviour of the complexes has been studied by TGA and DTA techniques. From the non-isothermal TG data, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters have been calculated employing Coats-Redfern equation and the mechanism of decomposition has been computed using non-isothermal kinetic method. Thermal investigations on the blends of poly(methylmethacrylate). PMMA, with organotin(IV)-2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxides have shown increased thermal stability compared to pure PMMA suggesting thereby their potential as additives towards PMMA.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports a simple method to prepare barium sulphate nanoparticles by use of tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid and stearic acid as modifier. The barium sulphate nanoparticles obtained are characterized by using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic laser light scatter (DLLS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The results show that the BaSO<sub>4</sub> particles are all spherical and in the nano-scale. Our method has a better dispersion and controllable diameter dependent on the length of the chain of organic acid and the pH value of the system. A possible mechanism is also discussed.</p>

					<p>A time-dependent generalized non-linear Schr√∂dinger equation (GNLSE) of motion was earlier derived in our laboratory by combining density functional theory and quantum fluid dynamics in threedimensional space. In continuation of the work reported previously, the GNLSE is applied to provide additional knowledge on the femtosecond dynamics of the electron density in the hydrogen molecule interacting with high-intensity laser fields. For this purpose, the GNLSE is solved numerically for many time-steps over a total interaction time of 100 fs, by employing a finite-difference scheme. Various time-dependent (TD) quantities, namely, electron density, ground-state survival probability and dipole moment have been obtained for two laser wavelengths and four different intensities. The high-order harmonics generation (HHG) is also examined. The present approach goes beyond the linear response formalism and, in principle, calculates the TD electron density to all orders of change.</p>

				<title>Orientational dynamics and energy landscape features of thermotropic liquid crystals: An analogy with supercooled liquids</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0343-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent optical kerr effect (OKE) studies have revealed that orientational relaxation of rodlike nematogens near the isotropic-nematic (I-N) phase boundary and also in the nematic phase exhibit temporal power law decay at intermediate times. Such behaviour has drawn an intriguing analogy with supercooled liquids. Here, we have investigated the single-particle and collective orientational dynamics of a family of model system of thermotropic liquid crystals using extensive computer simulations. Several remarkable features of glassy dynamics are on display including non-exponential relaxation, dynamical heterogeneity, and non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the orientational relaxation time. Over a temperature range near the I-N phase boundary, the system behaves like a fragile glass-forming liquid. Using proper scaling, we construct the usual relaxation time versus inverse temperature plot and explicitly demonstrate that one can successfully define a density dependent fragility of liquid crystals. The fragility of liquid crystals shows a temperature and density dependence which is remarkably similar to the fragility of glass forming supercooled liquids. Energy landscape analysis of inherent structures shows that the breakdown of the Arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation rate occurs at a temperature that marks the onset of the growth of the depth of the potential energy minima explored by the system.</p>

					<p>The retarded interaction between an electron and a spin-0 nucleus, that has been derived from electro-dynamical perturbation theory is discussed here. A brief account of the derivation is given. The retarded form is correct through order $v^2/c^2$. Use of the relative coordinates leads to an effective oneelectron operator that can be used through all orders of perturbation theory. A few unitary transformations give rise to the interaction that is valid in the non-relativistic limit.</p>

				<title>Filled and empty states of carbon nanotubes in water: Dependence on nanotube diameter, wall thickness and dispersion interactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0367-0376</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have carried out a series of molecular dynamics simulations of water containing a narrow carbon nanotube as a solute to investigate the filling and emptying of the nanotube and also the modifications of the density and hydrogen bond distributions of water inside and also in the vicinity of the outer surfaces of the nanotube. Our primary goal is to look at the effects of varying nanotube diameter, wall thickness and also solute-solvent interactions on the solvent structure in the confined region also near the outer surfaces of the solute. The thickness of the walls is varied by considering single and multi-walled nanotubes and the interaction potential is varied by tuning the attractive strength of the 12-6 pair interaction potential between a carbon atom of the nanotubes and a water molecule. The calculations are done for many different values of the tuning parameter ranging from fully Lennard-Jones to pure repulsive pair interactions. It is found that both the solvation characteristics and hydrogen bond distributions can depend rather strongly on the strength of the attractive part of the solute-water interaction potential. The thickness of the nanotube wall, however, is found to have only minor effects on the density profiles, hydrogen bond network and the wetting characteristics. This indicates that the long range electrostatic interactions between water molecules inside and on the outer side of the nanotube do not make any significant contribution to the overall solvation structure of these hydrophobic solutes. The solvation characteristics are primarily determined by the balance between the loss of energy due to hydrogen bond network disruption, cavity repulsion potential and offset of the same by attractive component of the solute-water interactions. Our studies with different system sizes show that the essential features of wetting and dewetting characteristics of narrow nanotubes for different diameter and interaction potentials are also present in relatively smaller systems consisting of about five hundred molecules.</p>

				<title>Selective control of HOD photodissociation using CW lasers</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0377-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selective control of HOD photodissociation (H-O + D $\leftarrow$ HOD ‚Üí H + O-D) has been theoretically investigated using CW lasers with appropriate carrier frequency and |0, 0$\rangle$, |0, 1$\rangle$ and |0, 2$\rangle$ with zero quantum of excitation in the O-H bond and zero, one and two quanta of excitation in the O-D bond as the initial states. Results indicate that the O-H bond in HOD can be selectively dissociated with a maximum flux of 87&#37; in the H + O-D channel from the ground vibrational state |0, 0$\rangle$. For the O-D bond dissociation, it requires two quanta of excitation (|0, 2$\rangle$) in the O-D mode to obtain 83&#37; flux in the H-O + D channel. Use of a two colour laser set-up in conjunction with the field optimized initial state (FOIST) scheme to obtain an optimal linear combination of |0, 0$\rangle$ and |0, 1$\rangle$ vibrational states as the initial state provides an additional 7&#37; improvement to flux in the H-O + D channel as compared to that from the pure |0, 1$\rangle$ state.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0391-0399</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent extension of mean spherical approximation (MSA) for electrolyte solution has been employed to investigate the non-ideality in Born-free energy of solvation of a rigid, mono-positive ion in binary dipolar mixtures of associating (ethanol-water) and non-associating (dimethylsulfoxide-acetonitrile) solvents. In addition to the dipole moments, the solvent size ratio and ion size have been treated in a consistent manner in this extended MSA theory for the first time. The solvent-solvent size ratio is found to play an important role in determining the non-ideality in these binary mixtures. Smaller ions such as Li<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> show stronger non-ideality in such mixtures compared to bigger ions (for example, Cs<sup>+</sup> and Bu<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>). The partial solvent polarization densities around smaller ions in tertiary butanol (TBA)-water mixture is found to be very different from that in other alcohol-water mixtures as well as to that for larger ions in aqueous solutions of TBA. Non-ideality is weaker in mixtures consisting of solvent species possessing nearly equal diameters and dipole moments and is reflected in the mole fraction dependent partial solvent polarization densities.</p>

Floquet theory is used to transform the periodic time-dependent Hamiltonian, to a time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian. In this article contact transformation method has been used to get the analytical representation of Floquet Hamiltonian for quadrupolar nuclei with spin ùêº = 1 in the presence of an RF field and first order quadrupolar interaction in magic angle spinning NMR experiments.

					<p>Optimal control theory is applied to obtain infrared laser pulses for selective vibrational excitation in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule. The problem of finding the optimized field is phrased as a maximization of a cost functional which depends on the laser field. A time dependent Gaussian factor is introduced in the field prior to evaluation of the cost functional for better field shape. Conjugate gradient method$^{21,24}$ is used for optimization of constructed cost functional. At each instant of time, the optimal electric field is calculated and used for the subsequent quantum dynamics, within the dipole approximation.

				<title>Integrated rate expression for the production of glucose equivalent in C<sub>4</sub> green plant and the effect of temperature</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0449-0456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A temperature-dependent integrated kinetics for the overall process of photosynthesis in green plants is discussed. The C<sub>4</sub> plants are chosen and in these plants, the rate of photosynthesis does not depend on the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>. Using some basic concepts like chemical equilibrium or steady state approximation, a simplified scheme is developed for both light and dark reactions. The light reaction rate per reaction center ($R'_1$) in thylakoid membrane is related to the rate of exciton transfer between chlorophyll neighbours and an expression is formulated for the light reaction rate $R'_1$. A relation between $R'_1$ and the NADPH formation rate is established. The relation takes care of the survival probability of the membrane. The CO<sub>2</sub> saturation probability in bundle sheath is also taken into consideration. The photochemical efficiency (ùúô) is expressed in terms of these probabilities. The rate of glucose production is given by $R_{\text{glucose}} = (8/3)(R'_1v_L)\phi(T)g(T)$ ([G3P]/[$P_i$]$^2_{\text{leaf}}$)$_{SS}$Q$_{\text{G3P} \rightarrow \text{glucose}}$ where ùëî is the activity quotient of the involved enzymes, and G3P represent glycealdehyde-3-phosphate in steady state. A Gaussian distribution for temperaturedependence and a sigmoid function for de-activation are incorporated through the quotient ùëî. In general, the probabilities are given by sigmoid curves. The corresponding parameters can be easily determined. The theoretically determined temperature-dependence of photochemical efficiency and glucose production rate agree well with the experimental ones, thereby validating the formalism.</p>

				<title>Quantum chemical investigation of the reaction of O(${}^3P_2$) with certain hydrocarbon radicals</title>

				<page>0457-0465</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of ground-state atomic oxygen [O(${}^3P_2$)] with methyl, ethyl, ùëõ-propyl and isopropyl radicals has been studied using the density functional method and the complete basis set model. The energies of the reactants, products, reaction intermediates and various transition states as well as the reaction enthalpies have been computed. The possible product channels and the reaction pathways are identified in each case. In the case of methyl radical the minimum energy reaction pathway leads to the products CO + H<sub>2</sub> + H. In the case of ethyl radical the most facile pathway leads to the products, methanal + CH<sub>3</sub> radical. For propyl radical (ùëõ- and <i>iso</i><sup>-</sup>), the minimum energy reaction pathway would lead to the channel containing ethanal + methyl radical.</p>

				<title>Insertion of singlet chlorocarbenes across C-H bonds in alkanes: Evidence for two phase mechanism</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transition states for the insertion reactions of singlet mono and dichlorocarbenes (<sup>1</sup>CHCl and <sup>1</sup>CCl<sub>2</sub>) into C-H bonds of alkanes (methane, ethane, propane and ùëõ-butane) have been investigated at MP2 and DFT levels with 6-31g (ùëë , ùëù) basis set. The $p_\pi$ of <sup>1</sup>CHCl and <sup>1</sup>CCl<sub>2</sub> may interact with alkane‚Äôs filled fragment orbital of either ùúé or ùúã symmetry. So chlorocarbenes insertion reactions have been investigated for both (ùúé/ùúã) approaches. The ùúé approach has been adjudicated to be the minimum energy path over the ùúã approach both at the MP2 and DFT levels. Mulliken, NPA and ESP derived charge analyses have been carried out along the minimal energy reaction path using the IRC method for <sup>1</sup>CHCl and <sup>1</sup>CCl<sub>2</sub> insertions into the primary and secondary C-H bonds of propane. The occurrence of TSs either in the electrophilic or nucleophilic phase has been identified through NBO charge analyses in addition to the net charge flow from alkane to the carbene moiety.</p>

					<p>Quantitative-structure-toxicity-relationship (QSTR) models are developed for predicting the toxicity (pIGC<sub>50</sub>) of 252 aliphatic compounds on <i>Tetrahymena pyriformis</i>. The single parameter models with a simple molecular descriptor, the number of atoms in the molecule, provide reasonable results. Better QSTR models with two parameters result when global electrophilicity is used as the second descriptor. In order to tackle both charge- and frontier-controlled reactions the importance of the local electro (nucleo) philicities and atomic charges is also analysed.</p>

					<p>In this paper, we study the reactivity of diimines like 2,2'-bipyridine and its analogues using reactivity descriptors. We discuss evaluation of local descriptors using relaxed as well as frozen approximation and characterize the ùúé/ùúã acceptance/donor characteristics of the above ligands. The intermolecular reactivity sequence for the same systems is examined by the global and local philicity index.

				<title>Theoretical investigation of redox species in condensed phase</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0501-0508</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We give a detailed description of the use of explicit as well as implicit solvation treatments to compute the reduction potentials of biomolecules in a medium. The explicit solvent method involves quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) treatment of the solvated moiety followed by a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of the primary solvent layer. The QM task for considerably large biomolecules is normally carried out by density functional treatment (DFT) along with the MM-assisted evaluation of the most stable configuration for the primary layer and biomolecule complex. The MC simulation accounts for the dynamics of the associated solvent molecules. Contributions of the solvent molecules of the bulk towards the absolute free energy change of the reductive process are incorporated in terms of the Born energy of ion-dielectric interaction, the Onsager energy of dipole-dielectric interaction and the Debye-H√ºckel energy of ion-ionic cloud interaction. In the implicit solvent treatment, one employs the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Thus the contribution of all the solvent molecules towards the free energy change are incorporated by considering the whole solvent as a dielectric continuum.</p>
					<p>As an example, the QM(DFT)/MM/MC-Born/Onsager/Debye-H√ºckel corrections yielded the oneelectron reduction potential of Pheophytin-a in the solvent DMF as $‚àí0.92 \pm 0.27$ V and the two-electron reduction potential as $‚àí1.34 \pm 0.25$ V at 298.15 K while the DFT-DPCM method yielded the corresponding values as $‚àí1.03 \pm 0.17$ V and $‚àí1.30 \pm 0.17$ V, respectively. The calculated values more or less agree with the observed mid-point potentials of ‚àí0.90 V and ‚àí1.25 V, respectively. Moreover, a numerical finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann solution along with the DFT-DPCM methodology was employed to calculate the reduction potential of Pheophytin-a within the thylakoid membrane. The calculated reduction potential value of ‚àí0.58 V is in agreement with the reported value of ‚àí0.61 V that appears in the socalled ùëç-scheme and is considerably different from the value <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chiral discrimination and recognition is important in peptide biosynthesis, amino acid synthesis and drug designing. Detailed structural information is available about the peptide synthesis in ribosome. However, no detailed study is available about the discrimination in peptide synthesis. We study the conformational energy variation of neutral methoxy phenyl alanine molecule as a function of its different dihedral angle to locate the minimum energy conformation using quantum chemical theory. We compared the intermolecular energy surfaces of phenyl alanine molecule in its neutral and zwitterionic state using quantum chemical theory as a function of distance and mutual orientation. The energy surfaces are studied with rigid geometry by varying the distance and orientation. The potential energy surfaces of ùêø-ùêø and ùê∑-ùêø pairs are found to be dissimilar and reflect the underlying chirality of the homochiral pair and racemic nature of the heterochiral pair. The intermolecular energy surface of homochiral pair is more favourable than the corresponding energy surface of heterochiral pair.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The base pairing patterns in RNA structures are more versatile and completely different as compared to DNA. We present here results of <i>ab-initio</i> studies of structures and interaction energies of eight selected RNA base pairs reported in literature. Interaction energies, including BSSE correction, of hydrogen added crystal geometries of base pairs have been calculated at the HF/6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> level. The structures and interaction energies of the base pairs in the crystal geometry are compared with those obtained after optimization of the base pairs. We find that the base pairs become more planar on full optimization. No change in the hydrogen bonding pattern is seen. It is expected that the inclusion of appropriate considerations of many of these aspects of RNA base pairing would significantly improve the accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction.</p>

				<page>0533-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The gas-phase reaction mechanism of ùëÇ-acylhydroxamate with cysteine proteases has been investigated using <i>ab initio</i> and density functional theory. On the irreversible process, after breakdown of tetrahedral intermediate (INT1), small 1-2 anionotropic has been formed and rearranged to give stable by-products sulfenamide (P1) and thiocarbamate (P2) with considerable energy loss. While, on the reversible part of this reaction mechanism, intermediate (INT2) breaks down on oxidation, to form a stable product (P3). Topological and AIM analyses have been performed for hydrogen bonded complex in this reaction profile. Intrinsic reaction coordinates [IRC, minimum-energy path (MEP)] calculation connects the transition state between R-INT1, INT1-P1 and INT1-P2. The products P1, P2 and P3 are energetically more stable than the reactant and hence the reaction enthalpy is found to be exothermic.</p>

We modelled the 3D complex structure of B-cell epitope antigen residues CTTPAQGNSMFPSCCCTKPTDGNCY by homology modelling and docked it with the crystal structure of monoclonal antibody specific for the pres1 region of the hepatitis B virus. At the optimized docked conformation, the interactions between the amino acids of antigen and antibody were examined. It is found that the docked complex is stabilized by 59.3 kcal/mol. The stability of the docked antigen-antibody complex is due to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.

				<page>0559-0563</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Comparative genome sequence analysis is a powerful technique for gaining insights into any genome of interest. <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is a human pathogen, which causes life-threatening diseases, such as pneumoniae, bacteremia, meningitis, etc. After the whole genome of two strains of <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, the virulent TIGR4 and non-pathogenic R6 were sequenced; there is a hope that comparing the genomes will allow an identification of the genes responsible for its virulence and thus the development of treatment and control. Many antimicrobial drugs have diminished the risk from pneumococcal disease because of its multi-drug resistance nature. Several pneumococcal proteins are also being investigated, as virulence factors as potential vaccine or drug targets. Structural and biochemical studies of these pneumococcal virulence factors have facilitated the development of novel antibiotics or protein antigen-based vaccines for the treatment of pneumococcal disease. Here we describe the comparison between the genomes of two strains of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> with few existing genomics databases and tools available in the public domain websites. By comparing nucleotide and protein sequences of the two strains, we investigate the existing differences and similarities. Mainly we focus on the virulence factors and its encoding genes in TIGR4 and how do they differ from R6 strain.</p>

					<p>In this study we present ab initio Hartree Fock molecular orbital calculations with complete geometry optimizations on some phenylalkylamines (PAAs) that are clinically used as antiarrhythmic drugs. Pharmacophoric features of PAAs have been derived. An explanation of potency regulation in PAAs has been suggested based on ion capturing vs. ion holding by the drug. Ion capturing by the drug is always electrostatically highly favourable but has to be analysed in terms of conformational changes required and physiological accessibility of the situation. Our results also seem to offer an explanation for inhibitory effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration on binding affinity of PAAs.</p>

				<title><i>In silico</i> characterization of antifreeze proteins using computational tools and servers</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0571-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, seventeen different fish Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs) retrieved from Swiss-Prot database are analysed and characterized using In silico tools. Primary structure analysis shows that most of the AFPs are hydrophobic in nature due to the high content of non-polar residues. The presence of 11 cysteines in the rainbow smelt fish and sea raven fish AFPs infer that these proteins may form disulphide (SS) bonds, which are regarded as a positive factor for stability. The aliphatic index computed by Ex-Pasy‚Äôs ProtParam infers that AFPs may be stable for a wide range of temperature. Secondary structure analysis shows that most of the fish AFPs have predominant Œ±-helical structures and rest of the AFPs have mixed secondary structure. The very high coil structural content of rainbow smelt fish and sea raven fish AFPs are due to the rich content of more flexible glycine and hydrophobic proline amino acids. Proline has a special property of creating kinks in polypetide chains and disrupting ordered secondary structure. SOSUI server predicts one transmembrane region in winter flounder fish and atlantic cod and two transmembrane regions in yellowtail flounder fish AFP. The predicted transmembrane regions were visualized and analysed using helical wheel plots generated by EMBOSS pepwheel tool. The presence of disulphide (SS) bonds in the AFPs Q01758 and P05140 are predicted by CYS_REC tool and also identified from the three-dimensional structure using Rasmol tool. The disulphide bonds identified from the three-dimensional structure using the Rasmol tool might be correct as the evaluation parameters are within the acceptable limits for the modelled 3D structures.</p>

					<p>The reaction of barium carbonate with 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-nbaH) results in the formation of a Ba(II) coordination polymer, <i>catena</i>-poly[[(pentaaqua)(4-nitrobenzoato-O,O')barium(II)](ùúá-4-nitrobenzoato-O,O')] <b>1</b>.

In <b>1</b> five water molecules are coordinated to the central metal and one of the 4-nba ligands is bonded to Ba(II) in a bidentate manner (4-nba-O,O') through the carboxylate O atoms. The [(pentaaqua)(4-nitrobenzoato-O,O')barium(II)] units are linked into an infinite one-dimensional chain along ùëè-axis with the aid of the second 4-nba anion, which functions as a bridging bidentate (ùúá-4-nba-O,O') ligand. This results in nine coordination around each Ba(II) ion in the coordination polymer. A long Ba$\cdots$Ba distance of 6.750(1) √Ö is observed between adjacent Ba(II) ions in the chain and the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group and the nitro functionalities of the 4-nba ligand are involved in several O-H$\cdots$O and C-H$\cdots$O interactions.</p>

				<title>Solvent effects in the reaction between piperazine and benzyl bromide</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0613-0616</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction between piperazine and benzyl bromide was studied conductometrically and the second order rate constants were computed. These rate constants determined in 12 different protic and aprotic solvents indicate that the rate of the reaction is influenced by electrophilicity (ùê∏), hydrogen bond donor ability (ùõº) and dipolarity/polarizability ($\pi^\ast$) of the solvent. The LSER derived from the statistical analysis indicates that the transition state is more solvated than the reactants due to hydrogen bond donation and polarizability of the solvent while the reactant is more solvated than the transition state due to electrophilicity of the solvent. Study of the reaction in methanol, dimethyl formamide mixtures suggests that the rate is maximum when dipolar interactions between the two solvents are maximum.</p>

				<title><i>Ab initio</i> study of gas phase and water-assisted tautomerization of maleimide and formamide</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0617-0624</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Maleimide serves as an important starting material in the synthesis of drugs and enzyme inhibitors. In the present paper, knowing the importance of tautomerization in maleimide for its drug action, potential energy surface of maleimide is studied and its tautomerization has been discussed and compared with tautomerization of formamide. Gas phase tautomerization of maleimide requires large amount of energy (23.21 kcal/mol) in comparison to formamide (15.05 kcal/mol) at HF/$6-31+$G<sup>&#8727;</sup> level. Thus making the proton transfer reaction a difficult process in gas phase. Water molecule lowers the energy barrier of tautomerization thus facilitating the tautomerization of maleimide to 5-hydroxy-pyrrol-2-one. Water assisted tautomerization of maleimide requires 19.60 kcal/mol energy at HF/$6-31+$G<sup>&#8727;</sup> and 17.63 kcal/mol energy at B3LYP/6-31+G<sup>&#8727;</sup> level, a decrease of 3.61 and 5.96 kcal/mol over gas phase tautomerization. Whereas, tautomerization of formamide requires 14.16 and 12.84 kcal/mol energy, a decrease of 0.89 and 2.01 kcal/mol energy over gas phase tautomerization at HF/6-31+G<sup>&#8727;</sup> and B3LYP/6-31+G<sup>&#8727;</sup> level, respectively. Water-assisted tautomerization in maleimide and formamide showed that difference in energy barrier reduces to 2.83 kcal/mol from 10.41 kcal/mol (in gas phase) at B3LYP level, which resulted that maleimide readily undergoes tautomerization in water molecule.</p>

				<title>Molecular modelling studies on 2-amino 6-aryl-sulphonylbenzonitriles as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors of HIV-1: A QSPR approach</title>

				<page>0625-0630</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lipophilicity or hydrophobicity is a crucial physico-chemical property of an oral drug compound. In the present study, we have analysed the structural parameters responsible for enhancing the lipophilicity expressed in terms of Octanol-Water partition coefficient, log ùëÉ, of 2-amino-6-arylsulfonylbenzonitrile (AASBN) derivatives used as NNRTIs in AIDS therapy. Connectivity based Randic (ùúí) and Balaban (ùêΩ) and atomistic Kier-Hall electrotopological state (ùê∏-state) indices have been used to develop Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) and to predict the effect of substitution on the log ùëÉ. Model has been developed using multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) for the training set (67 compounds) and the model was tested on a test set (7 compounds). Significant results were obtained for the training set ($R^2 = 0.948$, $R^2_{\text{adj}} = 0.939$, $SE = 0.177$, $F$-ratio = 101.22). The results of the test set too implicated a good fit ($R^2 = 0.941$, $R^2_{\text{adj}} = 0.929$, $SE = 0.157$, $F$-ratio = 80.05). Among the two connectivity based topological indices; Randic (ùúí) index showed better predictive ability than the Balaban (ùêΩ) index. Kier-Hall ùê∏-state indices indicated that among the functional groups, methyl, bromo, chloro groups on ring A, with their positive coefficients enhanced the lipophilicity. Amino, cyano group on ring B and the bridging S, SO, SO<sub>2</sub> with their negative coefficients showed an adverse effect on the lipophilicity parameter. Thus, Kier-Hall ùê∏-state indices along with topological indices could be well applied for deriving QSPR models and analysing substitution effects of various functional groups. The training set, correlation matrix and observed and experimental log ùëÉ values are available as supplementary material for this article.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Graphenes prepared by three different methods have been investigated as electrode materials in electrochemical supercapacitors. The samples prepared by exfoliation of graphitic oxide and by the transformation of nanodiamond exhibit high specific capacitance in aq. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the value reaching up to 117 F/g. By using an ionic liquid, the operating voltage has been extended to 3.5 V (instead of 1 V in the case of aq. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), the specific capacitance and energy density being 75 F/g and 31.9 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> respectively. This value of the energy density is one of the highest values reported to date. The performance characteristics of the graphenes which are directly related to the quality, in terms of the number of layers and the surface area, are superior to that of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes.</p>

				<title>Ultrafast fluorescence resonance energy transfer in a bile salt aggregate: Excitation wavelength dependence</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0015-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Coumarin 153 (C153) to Rhodamine 6G (R6G) in a secondary aggregate of a bile salt (sodium deoxycholate, NaDC) is studied by femtosecond up-conversion. The emission spectrum of C153 in NaDC is analysed in terms of two spectra-one with emission maximum at 480 nm which corresponds to a non-polar and hydrophobic site and another with maximum at ‚àº 530 nm which arises from a polar hydrophilic site. The time constants of FRET were obtained from the rise time of the emission of the acceptor (R6G). In the NaDC aggregate, FRET occurs in multiple time scales -4 ps and 3700 ps. The 4 ps component is assigned to FRET from a donor (D) to an acceptor (A) held at a close distance ($R_{\text{DA}} \sim 17$ √Ö) inside the bile salt aggregate. The 3700 ps component corresponds to a donor-acceptor distance &#8764; 48 √Ö. The long (3700 ps) component may involve diffusion of the donor. With increase in the excitation wavelength ($\lambda_{\text{ex}}$) from 375 to 435 nm, the relative contribution of the ultrafast component of FRET (&#8764; 4 ps) increases from 3 to 40&#37; with a concomitant decrease in the contribution of the ultraslow component (‚àº3700 ps) from 97 to 60&#37;. The $\lambda_{ex}$ dependence is attributed to the presence of donors at different locations. At a long $\lambda_{\text{ex}}$ (435 nm) donors in the highly polar peripheral region are excited. A short $\lambda_{\text{ex}}$ (375 nm) `selects‚Äô donor at a hydrophobic location.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The galvanostatic polymerization of pyrrole is carried out on stainless steel electrodes using ùëù-toluene sulphonic acid. The morphology of the film is studied from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements while the nature of the substrate is analysed using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) technique. The electrochemical behaviour is studied using cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge analysis and impedance spectroscopy. The feasibility of the electrode for supercapacitor applications is investigated. The specific capacitance is estimated as ‚àº 10<sup>2</sup> Farads per gram with 10<sup>3</sup> charge-discharge cycles. A plausible equivalent circuit for the system is proposed and the circuit parameters are obtained by non-linear regression analysis.</p>

				<page>0045-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relaxation dynamics of the excited singlet states of 2,5-<i>bis</i>-(N-methyl-N-1,3-propdienylaniline)-cyclopentanone (MPAC), a ketocyanine dye, have been investigated using steady-state absorption and emission as well as femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopic techniques. Following photoexcitation using 400 nm light, the molecule is excited to the S<sub>2</sub> state, which is fluorescent in rigid matrices at 77 K. S<sub>2</sub> state is nearly non-fluorescent in solution and has a very short lifetime ($0.5 \pm 0.2$ ps). In polar aprotic solvents, the S<sub>1</sub> state follows a complex multi-exponential relaxation dynamics consisting of torsional motion of the donor groups, solvent re-organization as well as photoisomerization processes. However, in alcoholic solvents, solvent re-organization via intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction is the only relaxation process observed in the S<sub>1</sub> state. In trifluoroethanol, a strong hydrogen bonding solvent, conversion of the non-hydrogen-bonded form, which is formed following photoexcitation, to the hydrogen-bonded complex has been clearly evident in the relaxation process of the S<sub>1</sub> state.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0057-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed methodology for NMR quantum computing focusing on enhancing the efficiency of initialization, of logic gate implementation and of readout. Our general strategy involves the application of rotating frame pulse sequences to prepare pseudopure states and to perform logic operations. We demonstrate experimentally our methodology for both homonuclear and heteronuclear spin ensembles. On model two-spin systems, the initialization time of one of our sequences is three-fourths (in the heteronuclear case) or one-fourth (in the homonuclear case), of the typical pulsed free precession sequences, attaining the same initialization efficiency. We have implemented the logical SWAP operation in homonuclear AMX spin systems using selective isotropic mixing, reducing the duration taken to a third compared to the standard re-focused INEPT-type sequence. We introduce the 1D version for readout of the rotating frame SWAP operation, in an attempt to reduce readout time. We further demonstrate the Hadamard mode of 1D SWAP, which offers 2<sup>N</sup>-fold reduction in experiment time for a system with ùëÅ-working bits, attaining the same sensitivity as the standard 1D version.</p>

				<title>Effects of ion concentration on the hydrogen bonded structure of water in the vicinity of ions in aqueous NaCl solutions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0071-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations of dilute and concentrated aqueous NaCl solutions are carried out to investigate the changes of the hydrogen bonded structures in the vicinity of ions for different ion concentrations. An analysis of the hydrogen bond population in the first and second solvation shells of the ions and in the bulk water is done. Although essentially no effect of ions on the hydrogen bonding is observed beyond the first solvation shell of the ions for the dilute solutions, for the concentrated solutions a noticeable change in the average number of water-water hydrogen bonds is observed in the second solvation shells of the ions and even beyond. However, the changes in the average number of hydrogen bonds are found to be relatively less when both water-water and ion-water hydrogen bonds are counted. Thus, the changes in the total number of hydrogen bonds per water are not very dramatic beyond the first solvation shell even for concentrated solutions.</p>

				<title>Growth of anisotropic gold nanostructures on conducting glass surfaces</title>

				<page>0079-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we describe a method for the growth of gold nanowires and nanoplates starting from a bilayer array of gold seeds, anchored on electrically conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. This is based on a seed-mediated growth approach, where the nanoparticles attached on the substrate through molecular linkages are converted to nanowires and nanoplates at certain cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) concentration. Our modified approach can be used to make nanowires of several tens of micrometers length at a lower CTAB concentration of 0.1 M. The length of the nanowires can be varied by adjusting the time of the reaction. As the concentration of CTAB was increased to 0.25 M, the nanoparticles got converted to nanoplates. These Au nanoplates are (111) oriented and are aligned parallel to the substrate.</p>

					<p>The reaction of [RhCl<sub>2</sub>(HPhL)(PhL)] with M<sup>II</sup>(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2.6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O in presence of alkali has furnished trinuclear [RhCl<sub>2</sub>(PhL)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>M(H<sub>2</sub>O)$_2.$H<sub>2</sub>O (HPhL is phenylazobenzaldoxime; M = Mn, Co, Ni). A similar reaction with M<sup>I</sup>(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> yielded binuclear [RhCl<sub>2</sub>(PhL)<sub>2</sub>]M(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (M = Cu, Ag). In these molecules the oximato group acts as a bridge between Rh<sup>III</sup> (bonded at N) and M<sup>II</sup> or M<sup>I</sup> (bonded at O). In structurally characterized [Rh<sup>III</sup>Cl<sub>2</sub>(PhL)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>Mn(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O the centrosymmetric distorted octahedral MnO6 coordination sphere is spanned by four oximato oxygen atoms and two water molecules lying in trans position. In the lattice the neighbouring molecules are held together by H<sub>2</sub>O$\cdots$H<sub>2</sub>O$\cdots$H<sub>2</sub>O hydrogen bonds generating infinite zigzag chains. The manganese atoms lie parallel to the C-axis, the shortest Mn‚Ä¶Mn distance being 7.992 √Ö. Magnetic exchange interactions if any are small as seen in room temperature magnetic moments. The manganese system displays a strong EPR signal near ùëî = 2.00. In the complex [RhCl<sub>2</sub>(PhL)<sub>2</sub>]Cu(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> the copper atom is coordinated to two oximato oxygen atoms and the two phosphorus atoms in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The softness of the phosphine ligand is believed to sustain the stable coordination of hard oximato oxygen to soft Cu<sup>I</sup>. The coordination sphere of the Rh<sup>III</sup> atom in both the complexes is uniformly <i>trans</i>-RhN<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p>

				<title>Cyclic porphyrin dimers as hosts for coordinating ligands</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bicovalently linked tetraphenylporphyrins bearing dioxypentane groups at the opposite (transoid, H<sub>4</sub>A) and adjacent (cisoid, H<sub>4</sub>B) aryl groups have been synthesised. Protonation of the free-base porphyrins leads to fully protonated species H<sub>8</sub>A<sup>4+</sup>/H<sub>8</sub>A<sup>4+</sup> accompanied by expansion of cavity size of the bisporphyrins. The electrochemical redox studies of these porphyrins and their Zinc(II) derivatives revealed that the first ring oxidation proceeds through a two-electron process while the second ring oxidation occurs at two distinct one-electron steps indicating unsymmetrical charge distribution in the oxidized intermediate. The axial ligation properties of the Zinc(Il) derivatives of H<sub>4</sub>A/H<sub>4</sub>B with DABCO and PMDA investigated by spectroscopic and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies showed predominant existence of 1 : I complex. The Zn<sub>2</sub>A.DABCO complex assumes an interesting eclipsed structure wherein DABCO is located inside the cavity between the two porphyrin planes with Zn-N distances at 2.08 and 2.22 √Ö. The Zn atoms are pulled into the cavity due to coordination towards nitrogen atoms of DABCO and deviate from the mean porphyrin plane by 0.35 √Ö. The electrochemical redox potentials of the axially ligated metal derivatives are found to be sensitive function of the relative coordinating ability of the ligands and the conformation of the hosts.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0137-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the non-linear optical properties of representative core-modified expanded porphyrins have been investigated with an emphasis on the structure-property relationship between the aromaticity and conformational behaviour. It has been shown that the measured two-photon absorption cross section ($\sigma^2$) values depend on the structure of macrocycle, its aromaticity and the number of ùúã-electrons in conjugation.</p>

				<title>Effect of thione-thiol tautomerism on the inhibition of lactoperoxidase by anti-thyroid drugs and their analogues</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0143-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The keto-enol type tautomerism in anti-thyroid drugs and their selenium analogues are described. The commonly used anti-thyroid drug methimazole exists predominantly in its thione form, whereas its selenium analogue exists in a zwitterionic form. To understand the effect of thione/thiol and selone/selenol tautomerism on the inhibition of peroxidase-catalysed reactions, we have synthesized some thiones and selones in which the formation of thiol/selenol forms are blocked by different substituents. These compounds were synthesized by a carbene route utilizing an imidazolium salt. The crystal structures of these compounds reveal that the C=Se bonds in the selones are more polarized than the C=S bonds in the corresponding thiones. The structures of selones were studied in solution by NMR spectroscopy and the <sup>77</sup>Se NMR chemical shifts for the selones show large upfield shifts in the signals, confirming their zwitterionic structures in solution. The inhibition of lactoperoxidase by the synthetic thiones indicates that the presence of a free N-H moiety is essential for an efficient inhibition. In contrast, such moiety is not required for an inhibition by the selenium compounds.</p>

					<p>Propargyloxycarbonyl group is used as a protecting group for the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine and tyrosine. The propargyloxycarbonyl derivatives of these hydroxy amino acids are stable to acidic and basic reagents commonly employed in peptide synthesis. The deprotection of the ùëÇ-Poc derivatives using tetrathiomolybdate does not affect commonly used protecting groups such as ùëÅ-Boc, ùëÅ-Cbz, ùëÅ-Fmoc, methyl and benzyl esters.

				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative study of the pore properties of SBA-15 samples prepared under nonhydrothermal and hydrothermal conditions, in the absence and presence of carboxylic acids such as succinic, tartaric and citric acids has been carried out. In the absence of carboxylic acid, flake-like and spheroid particles were generally obtained irrespective of the preparative procedures. On the other hand, stirring of the pre-mix induces a rod-like morphology in presence of carboxylic acids. The samples prepared under non-hydrothermal conditions exhibit a higher degree of silicate condensation compared to those synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. SBA-15 samples prepared under hydrothermal conditions show higher values of the d (100) spacing independent of the presence of carboxylic acids. Presence of carboxylic acids as well as hydrothermal treatment improves the pore properties of SBA-15.</p>

				<page>0187-0194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two acceptor containing polyimides PDI and NDI carrying pyromellitic diimide units and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxy diimide units, respectively, along with hexa(oxyethylene) (EO6) segments as linkers, were prepared from the corresponding dianhydrides and diamines. These polyimides were made to fold by interaction with specifically designed folding agents containing a dialkoxynaphthalene (DAN) donor linked to a carboxylic acid group. The alkali-metal counter-ion of the donor carboxylic acid upon complexation with the EO6 segment brings the DAN unit in the right location to induce a charge-transfer complex formation with acceptor units in the polymer backbone. This two-point interaction between the folding agent and the polymer backbone leads to a folding of the polymer chain, which was readily monitored by NMR titrations. The effect of various parameters, such as structures of the folding agent and polymer, and the solvent composition, on the folding propensities of the polymer was studied.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A kinetic study of the tumor-associated galactopyranosyl-(1‚Üí3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-ùõº-Dgalactopyranoside (T-antigen) with lectin peanut agglutinin is described. The disaccharide antigen was synthesized by chemical methods and was functionalized suitably for immobilization onto a carboxymethylated sensor chip. The ligand immobilized surface was allowed interaction with the lectin peanut agglutinin, which acted as the analyte and the interaction was studied by the surface plasmon resonance method. The ligand-lectin interaction was characterized by the kinetic on-off rates and a bivalent analyte binding model was found to describe the observed kinetic constants. It was identified that the antigen-lectin interaction had a faster association rate constant ($k_{a1}$) and a slower dissociation rate constant ($k_{d1}$) in the initial binding step. The subsequent binding step showed much reduced kinetic rates. The antigen-lectin interaction was compared with the kinetic rates of the interaction of a galactopyranosyl-($1\rightarrow 4$)-ùõΩ-D-galactopyranoside derivative and a mannopyranoside derivative with the lectin.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Acridizinium cation (ACR) and 2,3-dimethylisoquinolinium ion (DMIQ) undergo [$2 + 4^+$] addition with dienophiles methyl vinyl ether (MVE) and propylene (PY) and the addition takes place across the diene unit containing the cationic centre and the dienophile acts as the electron donor. These reactions have two regiochemical paths and in each of them two possible stereo adducts could be formed. DFT calculations performed at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level have shown that the reactions pass through concerted mechanism and the TSs are highly asynchronous. Methoxy group in the dienophile can take up <i>cis</i> or trans orientation with respect to the double bond and in that <i>trans</i> orientation of the methoxy group is preferred. Calculations further show that <i>syn</i> 2 adduct is kinetically and thermodynamically more favoured in both the reactions in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. ACR is found to be more reactive than DMIQ as a diene and as a dienophile MVE is found to be more reactive than PY. Computed bond orders establish that the <i>syn</i> 2 transition states are the most `reactant‚Äô like. Though the reactions have both electrostatic control and frontier orbital control the former dominates in the initial stages of the reaction.</p>

					<p>Role of alkali and alkaline earth ions on the formation of calix[4]arene-amide derivatives through ùëÇ-alkylation of the lower rim phenolic-OH groups in general and template action of K<sup>+</sup> in particular have been explored. Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions among alkali, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Sr<sup>2+</sup> ions among alkaline earth have shown tetra-amide derivatives bound to metal ion species. Among all these, potassium salts act as template and yields a K<sup>+</sup> bound tetra-amide derivative where the charge is counter balanced by a calix[4] arene-monoanion and the product is crystallographically characterized. Change in the amide precursor used in these ùëÇ-alkylation reactions has no effect on the type of the amide derivative formed.

On heating at 100&#176;C compound <b>1</b> is dehydrated to anhydrous barium <i>bis</i>(2-nitrobenzoate) <b>2</b>. The anhydrous compound can be re-hydrated to <b>1</b> on exposure to water vapour. Compounds <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> were characterized by elemental analysis, IR and UV-Vis spectra, DSC thermograms, weight loss studies and the structure of <b>1</b> was determined. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> can be thermally decomposed to BaCO<sub>3</sub> by heating at 800&#176;C. The polymer [[Ba(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O-NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O')<sub>2</sub>]$_n$ <b>1</b> crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic space group P$_{\bar{i}}$ and all atoms are located in general positions. The polymeric structure is based on a dimeric unit and consists of three water molecules coordinated to a central Ba(II) and two unique 2-nitrobenzoate (2-nba) anions, one of which ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O-NO<sub>2</sub>) functions as a tridentate ligand and is linked to a Ba(II) through the oxygen atom of the -NO<sub>2</sub> group and forms a monoatomic $\mu_2$-carboxylate bridge between two symmetry related Ba(II) ions with a Ba$\cdots$Ba distance of 4.5726(14) √Ö. The second unique 2-nba anion ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O') also functions as a tridentate ligand with the carboxylate oxygen atoms linked to a Ba(II) ion in a bidentate fashion and one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms forming a monoatomic bridge between two symmetry related Ba(II) ions resulting in a Ba$\cdots$Ba separation of 4.5406(15) √Ö. These differing tridentate 2-nba ligands link {Ba(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>} units into a one-dimensional polymeric chain extending along ùëè axis. In the infinite chain each nine coordinated Ba(II) is bonded to three water molecules and further linked to six oxygen atoms of four different 2-nitrobenzoate anions with alternating pairs of Ba(II) ions in the chain bridged by a pair of ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O-NO<sub>2</sub>) and ($\mu_2$-2-nba-O,O,O') ligands resulting in alternating Ba$\cdots$Ba distances of 4.5406(15) and 4.5726(14) √Ö across the chain.</p>

					<p>The synthesis and characterization of new <i>meso</i>-substituted unsymmetrical metalloporphyrins has been described. A new modified Adler method was used for the synthesis of two unsymmetrical porphyrins. Reactions of these unsymmetrical porphyrins with metal acetates afforded the corresponding metalloporphyrins in high yields with excellent purity.

				<title>Analysis of urinary stone constituents using powder X-ray diffraction and FT-IR</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0267-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Constituents of urinary stones obtained from various patients from western part of India, which is a highly urinary stone disease-prone area, have been analysed. Eight stones from four patients were collected through urologists and have been analysed using powder X-ray diffraction and FT-IR. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of selected samples were also carried out. The analysis revealed that calcium oxalate monohydrate, which is also known as whewellite, is the common constituent of all of the stones, particularly at the initial stage of stone formation. However, multi phases viz. whewellite phase, and hydroxyl and carbonate apatite phases are also detected in the case of third and fourth patients, from where multiple stones were obtained. Interestingly, in these mixed phase stones the concentration of whewellite decreases with increasing the concentration of apatite phases. Thermal behaviour of the whewellite phase was studied by TGA and variable temperature XRD analysis. Morphology of the whewellite and apatite phases, examined by SEM image, has also been reported.</p>

				<title>Structural transition in alcohol-water binary mixtures: A spectroscopic study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0275-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The strengthening of the hydrogen bonding (H-bond) network as well as transition from the tetrahedral-like water network to the zigzag chain structure of alcohol upon increasing the alcohol concentration in ethanol-water and tertiary butanol (TBA) - water mixtures have been studied by using both steady state and time resolved spectroscopy. Absorption and emission characteristics of coumarin 153 (C153), a widely used non-reactive solvation probe, have been monitored to investigate the structural transition in these binary mixtures. The effects of the hydrogen bond (H-bond) network with alcohol concentration are revealed by a minimum in the peak frequency of the absorption spectrum of C153 which occur at alcohol mole fraction &#8764; 0.10 for water-ethanol and at &#8764; 0.04 for water-TBA mixtures. These are the mole fractions around which several thermodynamic properties of these mixtures show anomalous change due to the enhancement of H-bonding network. While the strengthening of H-bond network is revealed by the absorption spectra, the emission characteristics show the typical non-ideal alcohol mole fraction dependence at all concentrations. The time resolved anisotropy decay of C153 has been found to be bi-exponential at all alcohol mole fractions. The sharp change in slopes of average rotational correlation time with alcohol mole fraction indicates the structural transition in the environment around the rotating solute. The changes in slopes occur at mole fraction &#8764; 0.10 for TBA-water and at &#8764; 0.2 for ethanol-water mixtures, which are believed to reflect alcohol mole fraction induced structural changes in these alcohol-water binary mixtures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An inorganic-organic hybrid material, [2-AmpH]<sub>4</sub>[Mo<sub>8</sub>O<sub>26</sub>] (<b>1</b>) has been isolated by the reaction of Na<sub>2</sub>MoO$_4¬∑2$H<sub>2</sub>O with 2-aminopyrimidine (2-Amp) from an acidic aqueous medium. In this low pH synthesis, the organic molecule (2-Amp) gets mono-protonated (2-AmpH<sup>+</sup>) and acts as the cation in stabilizing the octamolybdate anion in <b>1</b>. Compound <b>1</b> crystallizes in the triclinic space group ùëÉ-1 with ùëé = 9.925(3), ùëè = 10.020(3), ùëê = 10.414(3) √Ö, ùõº = 88.811(4), ùõΩ = 64.907(4), ùõæ = 89.506(4)&#176;, ùëç = 1. An interesting three-dimensional supramolecular structure, having well-defined channels, is formed through N-H$\cdots$O and C-H$\cdots$O hydrogen bonds, in which the protonated organic cation plays a significant role. The crystal structure also reveals an unusual cluster-cluster (non-covalent O$\cdots$O) interaction using <i>cis</i>-(MoO<sub>2</sub>} moieties of the isopolyanion. N-H$\cdots$O hydrogen bonds, originated from pyridimidinium cation and isopolyanion, are found to influence to attain such non-covalent O$\cdots$O interactions among polyoxometalate anions. An interesting helical arrangement, formed from isopolyanion and organic cation, is observed.</p>

					<p>The FTIR and FT Raman spectra of dacarbazine were recorded in the regions 4000-400 and 3500-100 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The optimized geometry, wavenumber, polarizability and several thermodynamic properties of dacarbazine were studied using <i>ab initio</i> Hartree-Fock, MP2 and DFT methods. A complete vibrational assignment aided by the theoretical harmonic wavenumber analysis was proposed. The calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies were compared with experimental FTIR and FT Raman spectra. Based on the comparison between calculated and experimental results and the comparison with related molecules, assignments of fundamental vibrational modes were made. The X-ray geometry and experimental frequencies were compared with the results of theoretical calculations.</p>

					<p>Kinetics of cleavage of phenylphenyl acetates (PPA) and several <i>para</i>-substituted PPAs in basic aqueous sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer containing ùõΩ-cyclodextrin (CD) have been studied. The reaction exhibits saturation type kinetics and CD accelerates the rate of cleavage by the formation of 1G : 1H inclusion complex. The kinetic results indicate that aryloxy moiety of PPA is included in the hydrophobic cavity of CD. The overall rate constants for the cleavage of the [CD-ester] complex correlate with the Hammett ùúé-constants and Hansch hydrophobicity parameters ùúã. At higher concentrations of CD, there is an additional catalysis due to the formation of weak 1G : 2H complex.</p>

					<p>Possibility of the Maillard reaction to take place in the gaseous phase in the interstellar medium was investigated by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations. Cyclic ribose (<b>c-Rib</b>)/open-chain ribose (<b>c-Rib</b>) and glycine were taken as the model. Mechanisms have been proposed, and possibility of the formation of different compounds have been evaluated through calculating the Gibb‚Äôs free energy changes for different steps of the reaction by following the total mass balance. The result reveals that both <b>c-Rib</b> and <b>Rib</b> can participate in the reaction, and <b>c-Rib</b> is more efficient than <b>Rib</b>. The reactions under basic and neutral conditions are supposed to be the first and second most favourable. Acidic conditions and the isoelectric point of glycine were unfeasible for the reaction. The kinetics of the mechanics are briefly addressed in this work.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, photoluminescence and electrochemical properties of 2,7-diarylfluorene derivatives</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0355-0362</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new class of highly fluorescent 9,9'-<i>bis</i>-(alkyl)-2,7-diarylfluorene having electron withdrawing or electron donating groups on the ùëù-phenyl positions were synthesized and characterized. The highly luminescent fluorene derivatives, <b>1-6</b> showed blue emission (376-416 nm), narrow FWHM (‚àº 50 nm), high quantum yield ($\phi_{\text{F}} = 0.12-0.87$) and short fluorescence lifetimes, $\tau_{\text{F}} = 0.23-1.14$ ns. The HOMO levels of 9,9'-<i>bis</i>-(alkyl)-fluorene were tuned by the p-substituents at 2,7-phenyl group. Hammett correlation with $E_{\text{HOMO}}$ of these new molecules provides an effective tool to predict the HOMO level of similar molecules prior to the synthesis. These data indicate that they are useful as emitting materials for organic light emitting devices, OLEDs.</p>

					<p>Combined pH-metric and spectrophotometric investigations on the complex formation equilibria of Cu<sup>II</sup> with guanylurea (H$_2^1$NC(=O) <sup>2</sup>NH.C(=<sup>3</sup>NH) <sup>4</sup>NH<sub>2</sub>), hereafter, GuH, in the absence and in the presence of glycine (GlyH), in aqueous solution indicates variety of binary and mixed-ligand complexes: Cu(Gu)<sup>+</sup>, Cu(Gu)(OH); Cu(Gu)<sub>2</sub>, Cu(Gu-H)(Gu)<sup>-</sup>, Cu(Gu-H)$_2^{2-}$, Cu(Gu-H)(Gu-2H)$^{3-}$; Cu(Gly)<sup>+</sup>, Cu(Gly) (OH); Cu(Gly)(Gu); Cu(Gly)(Gu-H)<sup>-</sup>, Cu(Gly)(Gu-2H)<sup>2-</sup>; (Gly)Cu(Gu)Cu(Gly)<sup>+</sup>, (Gly)Cu(Gu-H)Cu(Gly) and (Gly)Cu(Gu-2H)Cu(Gly)<sup>-</sup>. At pH &#60; 6, guanylurea anion (Gu<sup>-</sup>) acts as a [(C=O), <sup>3</sup>N<sup>-</sup>] or [=<sup>1</sup>NH, <sup>3</sup>N<sup>-</sup>] bidentate ligand and above pH 7 it is transformed through a coordination equilibrium into a (=<sup>1</sup>N<sup>-</sup>, =<sup>3</sup>N<sup>-</sup>) bidentate ligand, similar to biguanide dianion. Occurrence of dinuclear complex species, (Gly) Cu(Gu)Cu(Gly)<sup>+</sup>, in the complexation equilibria, indicates bridging double bidentate [(<sup>1</sup>NH<sub>2</sub>, <sup>3</sup>N<sup>-</sup>), (C=O, <sup>4</sup>NH<sub>2</sub>)] and/or [(<sup>1</sup>NH<sub>2</sub>, <sup>4</sup>NH<sub>2</sub>), (C=O, <sup>3</sup>N<sup>-</sup>)] chelation by Gu<sup>-</sup> ion in an isomeric equilibrium. Above pH 6.5, the dinuclear complex decomposes mostly to the mononuclear species, Cu(Gly)(OH) and Cu(Gu)(OH) and only partly deprotonates to (Gly)Cu(Gu-H)Cu(Gly) and (Gly)Cu(Gu-2H)Cu(Gly)<sup>-</sup>.

				<title>Assessing ligand efficiencies using template-based molecular docking and Tabu-clustering on tetrahydroimidazo-[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives as HIV-1RT inhibitors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0395-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A template-based flexible docking simulation followed by `Tabu-clustering‚Äô was performed on a series of 38 TIBO derivatives as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) inhibitors. Four different templates of the Cl-TIBO (1-REV) were created and used as reference templates for docking and aligning. On the basis of the optimal conformation of the ligands, when fitting to the template, the respective scoring functions were obtained; different ligand efficiencies were evaluated and analysed. Statistical modelling using artificial neural network (ANN: $r^2 = 0.922$) and multiple linear regression method (MLR: $r^2 = 0.851$) showed good correlation between the biological activity, binding affinity, and different ligand efficiencies of the compounds, which suggest the robustness of the template-based binding conformations of these inhibitors. Our studies suggest that, template-based docking followed by ‚ÄòTabuclustering‚Äô will give a better alignment of inhibitors with respect to the crystal coordinates and enhance the docking efficiency. Also, our study indicates that scoring functions based on 3D symmetry analysis along with heavy atoms count serve as a valuable tool for estimating the efficiency of the ligands. Thus, this is a novel method based on heavy atoms count predicting the binding affinity of the TIBO group of inhibitors, so that their therapeutic utility can be enhanced.</p>

					<p>The surface geometry of methyl 3-(4-methoxy phenyl)prop-2-enoate molecule was studied by analysis of the SERS spectra adsorbed on silver colloid surfaces. For a reliable analysis of the SERS spectrum, we also performed density functional theoretical calculations. The absence of a C-H stretching vibrations and the observed C-H out-of-plane bending modes suggest that the MMP molecule may be adsorbed in a flat on orientation to the surface. The SERS spectral studies predict a tilted orientation of ethylenic bridge with respect to the phenyl ring.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Catalytic efficiency of two Schiff base manganese(III) complexes toward the hydrolysis of <i>bis</i>(ùëù-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) was evaluated in a micellar media formed by <i>bis</i>(hexadecyldimethylammonium) hexane bromide (abbr.16-6-16, 2Br<sup>-</sup>) at $25^\circ$C. Effects of various reaction conditions on the hydrolysis of BNPP were systematically investigated. The observations obtained indicate that the two Mn(III) catalysts can efficiently promote hydrolysis of BNPP with a six order of magnitude rate enhancement relative to the background rate constant ($k_0$). Different structures of the two complexes lend to their distinguishing activities each other. Furthermore, rates of BNPP hydrolysis in Gemini 16-6-16 micellar medium are much higher than that in hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and ùëõ-lauroylsarcosine sodium (LSS) micelles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and highly sensitive electrochemical method for the determination of human serum albumin (HSA) using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), based on a silver electrode modified with a self-assembled monolayer of L-cysteine, was developed. L-cysteine can be modified onto a silver electrode by covalent bonding through the sulfur to give stable and long-lived chemical electrodes. This electrode showed good sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility and time stability in the determination of trace amounts of HSA by DPV technique. The detection limit can be as low as $4 \times 10^{-17}$ mol/L. The optimum conditions for the determination were carefully investigated. This method had been applied to the determination of HSA in human serum samples. The results were in agreement with those given in standard method.</p>

				<title>Functionalized zinc porphyrin as light harvester in dye sensitized solar cells</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0455-0462</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new photosensitizer having two rhodanine acetic acid groups at <i>meso</i>-positions of a zinc porphyrin [<i>meso</i>-Rhod-Zn-Rhod] has been synthesized and characterized by UV-Visible, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, MALDI-MS, fluorescence spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. The new photosensitizer was tested in dye-sensitized solar cells with three different liquid redox electrolytes and compared its efficiency (ùúÇ) with dyad. Both dyad and triad were also tested in DSSC using a polymer gel redox electrolyte and observed low efficiency because of small short circuiting current i.e. I<sub>Sc</sub> though the IPCE is significantly high. The probable reason for the low efficiency small I<sub>Sc</sub> has been attributed to the internal resistance of the cell.</p>

					<p>Kinetics of base catalysed hydrolytic cleavage of ethyl ùõº-cyanocinnamate (ECC) and several para-substituted ECC have been investigated spectrophotometrically in the presence of anionic surfactant sodium laurylsulphate (NaLS). The rate of cleavage of ECC was retarded by NaLS. The pseudo-first order rate constants, $k_{\text{obs}}$, correlate with the Hammett $\sigma^+_p$ - constants. The $\rho^+$ value (0.86) in aqueous medium is less than $\rho^+$ value (1.11) in 0.02 M NaLS. Kinetic data were analysed by Menger-Portnoy and Piszkiwicz model. The substrate-micelle binding constants, $K_s$, correlate with the Hammett ùúé-constants and Hansch hydrophobicity constants - ùúã of the substituents.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Preparation and characterization of absolutely pure and stable nanoparticles of 5,10,15,20-meso-tetrakis phenyl porphyrin (TPP) and catalytically repute 5,10,15,20-meso-tetrakis pentaflurophenyl porphyrin (H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>20</sub>TPP) by improved ‚Äòreprecipitation method‚Äô is described. The innovation of this modified `reprecipitation method‚Äô lies on the judicial selection of organic solvent and amount of porphyrin solution to be injected in the aqueous media. Exactly similar process produces relatively small nanoparticles for TPP than that of H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>20</sub>TPP while the stability of the H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>20</sub>TPP nanoparticles is bit higher than nanoparticles of TPP. Absorption and emission spectra reveal that the formation of nanoparticles for both the cases is induced by J- and H-type aggregation. DFT calculations predict the optimized geometries and frontier molecular orbital, which favours the strength of face-to-face interaction with neighbour molecules to be more facile for TPP than that of H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>20</sub>TPP helping the latter to form bigger and relatively more stable and free-standing nanoparticles. The use of no other compounds except dichloromethane, a highly volatile organic solvent and respective porphyrins give absolutely pure nanoparticles. This improved method will lead to produce organic nanoparticles of ùúã-conjugated systems easily and efficiently.</p>

				<title>A study of nanostructured gold modified glassy carbon electrode for the determination of trace Cr(VI)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0493-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A nanostructured gold modified glassy carbon electrode (Au<i>nano</i>/GCE) was employed for the determination of trace chromium(VI). To prepare Au<i>nano</i>/GCE, the GCE was immersed into KAuCl<sub>4</sub> solution and electrodeposition was conducted at the potential of -0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 600 s. Scanning electron microscopy measurements show that the electrochemically synthesized gold nanoparticles were deposited in aggregated form. Any undue effects caused by the presence of foreign ions in the solution were also analysed to ensure that common interference in the determination of chromium(VI) by square wave voltammetry, do not influence the electrochemical response of the latter element. The results show that this method allows for Cr(VI) determinations with a much lower detection limit (0.01 ùúág $L^{-1}$) in the presence of excess of Cr(III) than the commonly used diethylenetriammine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) method. The method was applied to determine levels of chromium(VI) in tap water and sewage water.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sub-micron rods and spheres of cobalt succinate sesquihydrate and iron succinate trihydrate/pentahydrate respectively have been synthesized by the reverse micellar route. These precursors are an excellent source for the synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. Cubes of (edge length ‚àº 150 nm) Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and elongated particles of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (‚àº diameter of 200 nm) were obtained. The role of oxidation state of the metal ion in controlling the morphology of the nanostructured dicarboxylates has been investigated. Rods with shorter length were obtained when longer chain dicarboxylate was used as ligand. Heating in nitrogen atmosphere also provided pure Co and ùõº-Fe nanoparticles. The Fe nanoparticles show nearly 100&#37; superparamagnetism. Temperature-dependent magnetic studies show a Morin-like transition for Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles at 223 K and the Verwey transition at 115 K for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles. Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles showed antiferromagnetic ordering at 20 K.</p>

				<title>Removal of phase transfer agent leads to restricted dynamics of alkyl chains in monolayer protected clusters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0537-0546</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of phase transfer agent in the dynamics of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles has been investigated by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. The experiments were performed with octadecane thiol and dodecane thiol protected gold nanoparticles. The materials prepared were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and IR spectroscopy. Repeated purification of the monolayer protected gold clusters made the alkyl chains defect-free. Such effects are reflected in the infrared spectra. Interdigitation of the monolayers that followed the purification leads to alkyl chains with limited mobility. This was reflected in <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR linewidths. The NMR measurements indicate that the removal of phase transfer agent affects the dynamics of isolated clusters and those with interdigitated monolayers in different ways.</p>

				<title>ùëù-Aminoacetanilide mediated formation of assembly of Au nanoparticles</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0547-0555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, we report the formation of assembly of Au nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes in the presence of ùëù-aminoacetanilide. Citrate stabilized spherical Au NPs assembled into a linear array, the extent of which depended on the concentration of ùëù-aminoacetanilide in the medium. Higher concentrations led not only to the formation of longer assemblies but also branched ones. In addition, substantial fusion of NPs was observed at higher concentrations. UV-Vis spectra showed the appearance of a second peak at higher wavelength - the position of which shifted to the red with increasing concentration of ùëù-aminoacetanilide. Interestingly, the second peak could not only be influenced by the concentration of ùëù-aminoacetanilide but also by choosing different sizes of the spherical NPs at the initial stages. For example, when the particles were larger the shift could be observed at higher wavelengths than those starting with smaller particles. The present method allows organization of NPs into linear arrays based on the molecular properties of the `assembler‚Äô i.e. ùëù-aminoacetanilide. Also, the optical properties of the assembled NPs could be tuned with the choice of suitable sizes of the assembling NPs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we report the synthesis of high quality Cd$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$S nanocrystals alloy at 150&#176;C with changing the composition. The shifting of absorption and emission peak in shorter wavelength is obtained with increasing the mole fraction of zinc. The quantum yield (QY) value decreases with increasing the Cd mole fraction and the values are 0.08, 0.13 and 0.40 for Cd<sub>0.62</sub>Zn<sub>0.38</sub>S, Cd<sub>0.52</sub>Zn<sub>0.48</sub>S and Cd<sub>0.31</sub>Zn<sub>0.69</sub>S nanocrystals, respectively after 120 min of reaction. However, the full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) values are 45, 34 and 28 nm and the corresponding quantum yield (QY) values are 0.52, 0.17 and 0.13 for 0.5 mM, 1.5 mM and 3 mM of initial S concentrations, respectively. It is interesting to note that the radiative decay time is dominating with increasing the Cd content. Analysis suggests that the decay dynamics depends on the composition of Cd$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$S nanocrystals.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0565-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inorganic (silica-titania)-organic (polyethylene oxide) hybrid films with variable refractive index (RI) values were synthesized and Ag nanoparticles were generated <i>in situ</i> inside such hybrid films to develop coloured coatings specially on plastic substrates. The hybrid films and the corresponding Agincorporated films were prepared from sols derived from a mixture of silicon tetraethoxide (STE), 3-(glycidoxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS), titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and silver nitrate following a sol-gel dip-coating method and cured at low temperature (90&#176;C), followed by UV treatment with an energy equivalent to $5.3 \pm 0.1$ J cm<sup>-2</sup>. The equivalent SiO<sub>2</sub>: SiO<sub>1.5</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH(CH<sub>2</sub>)O : TiO<sub>2</sub>: Ag molar ratios (nominal) of the final cured films are varied in the ranges (67.9-0) : 29.1 : (0-67.9) : 3. The refractive index values of the cured hybrid films were found to be increased systematically from 1.475 to 1.710 with increasing Ti-component. The Ag-SPR peak, in case of silica-polyethylene oxide host (RI = 1.475), observed at 419 nm, gradually red-shifted to 497 nm upon increasing the Ticomponent (equivalent TiO2 content 67.9 mol&#37;; RI = 1.710) of the film. As a consequence, a systematic change of Ag-SPR position yielded yellow, yellowish-orange, orange, brownish-orange and orangish-brown coloured coatings.</p>

					<p>In the present study, two approaches have been used for enhancing the hydrogenation properties of Pd. In the first approach, metal thin film (Cu, Ag) has been deposited over Pd and hydrogenation properties of bimetal layer Cu (thin film)/Pd(thin film) and Ag(thin film)/Pd(thin film) have been studied. In the second approach, Ag metal nanoparticles have been deposited over Pd and hydrogenation properties of Ag (nanoparticle)/Pd (thin film) have been studied and compared with Ag(thin film)/Pd(thin film) bimetal layer system. The observed hydrogen sensing response is stable and reversible over a number of hydrogen loading and deloading cycles in both bimetallic systems. Alloying between Ag and Pd is suppressed in case of Ag(nanoparticle)/Pd(thin film) bimetallic layer on annealing as compared to Ag (thin film)/Pd(thin film).</p>

					<p>A solid hybrid molecular material containing 1-butyl 3-methyl imidazolium cations and Keggin anions of phosphotungstic acid has been synthesized.

The FTIR spectrum of the compound shows the fingerprint vibrational bands of both Keggin molecular anions and imidazolium cations. The aromatic C-H stretch region (2700-3250 cm<sup>-1</sup>) of imidazolium cation is split due to the interaction between the ring C-H and bulky Keggin anion. The red-shift in the UV-Vis spectra and the downfield <sup>31</sup>P MAS NMR chemical shift also confirm the electrostatic interaction between the ions in the compound.

					<p>Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) have been functionalized by both covalent and non-covalent means.

Solubilization in non-polar solvents has also been accomplished by non-covalent functionalization by using 1-pyrenebutanoicacid succinimidyl ester (PYBS). Non-covalent functionalization of DWNTs has been carried out by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyoxyethylene(40)nonylphenyl ether (IGPAL), both of which enable solubilization in aqueous media.

					<p>An experimental charge density study has been carried out on proton-transfer complexes exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) properties-melaminium tartrate monohydrate and L-asparaginium picrate employing high-resolution X-ray diffraction at 100 K. Both the complexes crystallize in non-centric space group P2<sub>1</sub> and the structures exhibit interesting patterns of N-H‚Ä¶O and O-H‚Ä¶O hydrogen bonding. Experimental determination of the dipole moment (ùúá) for the asymmetric unit reveals that for both the crystals, there is a large cooperative enhancement in the crystalline ùúá arising essentially due to hydrogen bond mediated charge transfer between the melaminium ion and the L-tartrate in one case, between the Lasparaginium ion and the picrate in the other complex. We have additionally performed theoretical calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level to understand the origin of enhancement of the dipole moments in the two systems.</p>

					<p>We have performed <i>ab initio</i> density functional theory calculations to investigate the formation energy and the effects of low dimensionality and reduced coordination on the magnetic properties of pseudomorphically grown monolayers of Co-Ag surface alloys on a Rh(111) substrate. We find that if such an alloy could form, its magnetic moment would be considerably enhanced relative to that of bulk Co. However, we also find that its formation is energetically disfavoured against phase-segregated forms; this can be mainly attributed to the high `chemical‚Äô cost of forming Ag-Co bonds. Trends in the variation of magnetic moment with alloy composition are largely consistent with the Stoner argument.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have modelled for the first time a chemodosimeter for As(III) detection in water. The chemodosimeter modelled is a 1,3-dithiole-2-thione derivative with an anthracene unit which has been previously described as a chemodosimeter for Hg(II) detection. Quantum chemical calculations at the DFT level have been used to describe the binding energies and selectivity of the chemodosimeter. We find that the dosimeter action is intrinsically dependent on the thiophillic affinity and the coordination sphere of the metal ion. Binding studies for a series of metal ions: Pb(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Ni(II) and As(III) followed by an analysis of the complete reaction pathway explains the high selectivity of the dosimeter towards As(III). The dosimeter efficiency is calculated as 66&#37; for As(III)-ion.</p>

				<title>Surfactant controlled switching of water-in-oil wetting behaviour of porous silica films grown at oil-water interfaces</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0637-0643</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selective permeation of oil and water across a porous medium, as in oil recovery operations, depends on the preferential wetting properties of the porous medium. We show a profound influence of surfactants in wetting of porous media and thus demonstrate a new route for the control of water-in-oil wetting of porous substrates by changing the concentration of surfactants in an aqueous sub-phase below the substrate. This strategy is employed to engineer partial reversible wetting transitions on a porous silica film. The film itself is grown and stabilized on a flat, macroscopic interface between an oil phase and an aqueous sub-phase. On increasing the surfactant (CTAB) concentration in the sub-phase, contact angle of a water drop (placed on the oil side of the film) changes from 140&#176; to 16&#176; in 25 min by diffusion of the surfactant across the porous film. On further replacement of the sub-phase with pure water, diffusion of the surfactant from the water drop back to the sub-phase was slower, increasing the contact angle in the process from 16&#176; to 90&#176; in 2 h. Wettability control by a cationic surfactant (CTAB) was found to be much faster (6 deg/min) than that offered by an anionic surfactant, SDS (0.05 deg/min). Switching of the surface wettability due to the surfactant diffusion may have implications in oil-water separation, chemical bed reactors and microfluidic devices.</p>

				<title>The role of specific interactions on dynamical processes in a room temperature ionic liquid</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0007-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes our ongoing efforts to comprehend the role of specific interactions on the dynamical processes such as rotational diffusion and photoisomerization in a typical room temperature ionic liquid. Rotational diffusion studies carried out with a pair of structurally similar non-dipolar solutes indicate that organic solutes do experience strong specific interactions even with the highly associative ionic liquids such that their rotation is hindered. Similar measurements carried out with a nonpolar and a dipolar solute in an ionic liquid and a conventional solvent reveal that even in ionic liquids, apart from the viscosity of the medium, the important parameters, which govern the solute rotation are the solvent-size and free volume in case of non-polar solutes, whereas for charged and dipolar solutes, it is the solute-solvent interaction strength. Photoisomerization studies dealing with a pair of carbocyanine derivatives have shed light on the influence of solvent viscosity and specific interactions on the rates of photoisomerization. Our results point to the fact that the positively charged as well as the negatively charged cyanine derivatives do not experience specific interactions with the ionic liquid such that the isomerization rates are affected. However, when the isomerization rates are compared with a conventional isoviscous solvent, it has been noticed that the rates of isomerization are solely governed by viscosity of the medium in case of the positively charged cyanine derivative. In contrast, photoisomerization rates of the negatively charged cyanine derivative are significantly faster in a conventional isoviscous solvent compared to the ionic liquid due to the specific interactions between the solute and the former, which lower the barrier height for isomerization.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, structures and stability (thermal and air) of allenylphosphonates of the type (OCH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)P(O)C(R)=C=CR'R" and [R"R'C=C=C(R)P(O)(OCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>C are discussed. Thermally activated dimerization (cycloaddition) of (OCH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)P(O)C(H)=C=CMe<sub>2</sub> leads to the phosphonocyclobutane [(OCH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)P(O)C(H)=]<sub>2</sub>[C-CMe<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub> (<b>18</b>). Many of these allenes undergo addition of diethylamine to lead to enaminophosphonates that are readily hydrolysed by water to lead to ùõΩ-ketophosphonates. The latter compounds are useful as Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reagents. Molecular structures of (OCH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)P(O)C(CH<sub>2</sub>OH)=C=CH<sub>2</sub> (<b>6</b>), [H<sub>2</sub>C=C=C(H)P(O)(OCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>C (<b>9</b>), (OCH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)P(O)CH=C=CH<sub>2</sub> (<b>12</b>), [(OCH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)P(O)C(H)=]<sub>2</sub>[C-CMe<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub> (<b>18</b>), and the ùõΩ-ketophosphonate (OCH<sub>2</sub>CMe<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)P(O)CH<sub>2</sub>)-C(O)CHMe<sub>2</sub> (<b>24</b>) have been determined. In compound <b>6</b>, intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl oxygen and the hydroxyl group leading to an infinite chain is observed. In <b>6</b>, there is a significant deviation (ca 7&#176;) from the orthogonality expected between the planes containing 4 atoms of (a) H<sub>2</sub>C=C and (b) C=C(H)P in the allene part.

				<abstract>
					<p>The addition of triphenylphosphine (PPh<sub>3</sub>), into [Et<sub>4</sub>N]<sub>4</sub>[Cu<sub>4</sub>(mnt)<sub>4</sub>] shifted its characteristic electronic spectral band at 377 nm to 372 nm which is identical to that of the monomeric species, [Et<sub>4</sub>N][Cu(mnt)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)]. This reaction was followed by electrochemical study and also by <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy. Such interconversion with the participation of breaking of bridging copper-$\mu_3$-sulfur bond with the formation of new copper-phosphorous bond led to the development of a catalytic cycle using excess PPh<sub>3</sub> and S or Se as the reacting substrates. The turnover number for the oxidation of PPh<sub>3</sub> by S was found to be $0.8 \times 10^{-2} s^{-1}$ and that with Se was $0.6 \times 10^{-2} s^{-1}$ using this catalytic system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The novel <i>vic</i>-dioxime ligand containing the 4-amino-1-benzyl piperidine group, $N,N'$-(4-amino-1-benzyl piperidine)-glyoxime, (LH<sub>2</sub>) has been prepared from 4-amino-1-benzyl piperidine with <i>anti</i>-dichloroglyoxime at -15&#176;C in absolute THF. Mononuclear Ni<sup>II</sup> metal complex has been obtained with 1 : 2 metal/ligand ratio. The Ni<sup>II</sup> complex of this ligand is proposed to be square planar geometry. IR spectra show that the ligand acts in a tetradentate manner and coordinates N<sub>4</sub> donor groups of LH<sub>2</sub> to Ni<sup>II</sup> ion. The detection of H-bonding (O-H$\cdots$O) in the [Ni(LH))<sub>2</sub>] (${\rm 1}$) metal complex by IR spectra supported the square-planar MN<sub>4</sub> coordination of mononuclear complex. The disappereance of H-bonding (O-H$\cdots$O) in the [Ni(L)<sub>2</sub>(BPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>2</b>) complex shows that the BPh$^+_2$-capped groups (BPh$^+_2$ cation formed BPh<sub>4</sub> anion) attaches to the main oxime core. MN<sub>4</sub> coordination of the [Ni(LH)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>1</b>) and [Ni(L)<sub>2</sub>(BPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>2</b>) metal complexes were also determined by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. In the trinuclear Cu<sup>II</sup>-Ni<sup>II</sup>-Cu<sup>II</sup> metal complexes, the Ni<sup>II</sup> ion centered into the main oxime core by the coordination of the imino groups while the two Cu<sup>II</sup> ions coordinate dianionic oxygen donors of the oxime groups and linked to the ligands of 1,10-phenanthroline, $2,2'$-bipyridine, and $4,4'$-bipyridine. The ligand and their mono and trinuclear metal complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, UV-Vis, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra, magnetic susceptibility measurements, molar conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, mass spectra and X-ray powder techniques. The cyclic voltammetric results show that the cathodic peak potential of [Ni(L)<sub>2</sub>(BPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] shifted toward more negative value compared to that of [Ni(LH)<sub>2</sub>], probably due to a decreasing effect of back donation of metal-oxime moieties as a result of the BPh$^+_2$-bridged complex formation. Also, the formation of the trinuclear Cu<sup>II</sup>-Ni<sup>II</sup>-Cu<sup>II</sup> metal complexes caused considerable changes on the CV behaviour of mononuclear [Ni(LH)<sub>2</sub>] (1) complex. The spectroelectrochemical study of [Ni(L)<sub>2</sub>(BPh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (2) showed distinctive spectral changes that the intensity of the band (ùúÜ = at 364 nm, assigned to $n \to \pi^\ast$ transitions) decreased and a new broad band in low intensity about 460 nm appeared as a result of the reduction of the nickel centered in the oxime core.</p>

					<p>Polystyrene-anchored Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), MoO<sub>2</sub>(II), UO2(II), Fe(III) and Zr(IV), complexes of the unsymmetrical dibasic tetradentate ONNO donor Schiff base derived from the condensation of chloromethylated polystyrene, 3-formylsalicylic acid, ethylenediamine and 2-benzoylacetanilide (PS-LH<sub>2</sub>) has been synthesized. The polystyrene anchored complexes have the formulae: PS-LM (where M = Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, MoO<sub>2</sub>, UO<sub>2</sub>), PS-LFeCl.DMF, PS-LMn$.2$DMF and PS-LZr(OH)$_2.$DMF. The polystyrene-anchored coordination compounds have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR, reflectance, ESR and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The per cent reaction conversion of polystyrene anchored Schiff base to polystyrene supported coordination compounds lies between 28.98 and 85.9. The coordinated dimethylformamide is completely lost on heating the complexes. The shifts of the ŒΩ(C=N)(azomethine) and ŒΩ(C-O)(phenolic) stretches have been monitored in order to find out the donor sites of the ligands. The Cu(II) complex is paramagnetic with square planar structure; the Ni(II) complex is diamagnetic with square planar structure; the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes are diamagnetic and have tetrahedral structure; the Mn(II) and Fe(III) complexes are paramagnetic and have octahedral structure; the MoO<sub>2</sub>(II) and UO<sub>2</sub>(II) complexes are diamagnetic and have octahedral structure and the Zr(IV) complexes are diamagnetic and have pentagonal bipyramidal structure.</p>

					<p>This article presents a simple method towards the preparation of functionalized silver nanoparticles in a continuous medium. Silver nanoparticles were obtained through AgNO<sub>3</sub> chemical reduction in ethanol and triethylenetetramine was used to stabilize and functionalize the metal. The product was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UVvisible spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Monocrystalline silver particles with cubic structure and an average size of 20 nm were obtained. The results reveal that it is possible to synthesize Ag nanoparticles functionalized with amine groups and that particle size is influenced by the processing route.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0095-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction of 4-(1-azetidinyl) benzonitrile (P4C) in deuterated and normal methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile has been studied in order to investigate the solvent isotope effects on reaction rates and yields. These quantities (reaction rates and yields) along with several other properties such as quantum yield and radiative rates have been found to be insensitive to the solvent isotope substitution in all these solvents. The origin of the solvent isotope insensitivity of the reaction is discussed and correlated with the observed slowing down of the solvation dynamics upon isotope substitution.</p>

				<title>A X-ray diffraction analysis on graphene layers of Assam coal</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0103-0106</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The so-called turbostatic structure of carbons in coal with randomly oriented stacking of the lamellae (graphene) produces intense peaks, which are the dominant features in its X-ray diffraction profiles. The diffractogram may be conveniently divided into two regions of reciprocal space, the medium S region (1 &#60; S &#60; 3 &#197;) and a high S region (S &#62; 3 &#197;) where $S = 4\pi \lambda^{-1} \sin \theta$. To better understand the molecular level structure of high sulphur Assam coal, two coal samples (Tirap-1 and Tirap-2) from Tirap colliery of Makum coalfield, Assam (India) has been interpreted in this study by using the X-ray diffraction profiles. Random layered (graphene) structural parameters of these coals were determined by using X-ray diffraction technique, which showed that the $L_a$ and $L_c$ are 64.99 &#197;  and 22.63 &#197; for Tirap-2 and 55.54 &#197; and 23.80 &#197; for that of Tirap-1 coals respectively. The position of ùõæ band was found to be at 4.34 &#197; and 4.13 &#197; for Tirap-2 and Tirap-1 coals respectively. The number of layers and average number of carbon atoms (N) per aromatic graphene were found to be 21 and 8 for both the coal samples. Proximate, ultimate and ash analysis of the two coal samples were also carried out in this investigation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) undergoes facile electron transfer reaction with vanadium (V) substituted Keggin-type heteropolyanions (HPA) [PV<sup>V</sup>W<sub>11</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>4-</sup> (PV<sub>1</sub>) and [PV$^V_2$W<sub>10</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>5-</sup> (PV<sub>2</sub>) in aqueous phosphate buffer of pH 6 at ambient temperature. Electrochemical and optical studies show that the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1 : 2 (NADH : HPA). EPR and optical studies show that HPA act as one electron acceptor and the products of electron transfer reactions are one electron reduced heteropoly blues (HPB), viz. [PV<sup>IV</sup>W<sub>11</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>5-</sup> and [PV<sup>IV</sup>V<sup>V</sup>W<sub>10</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>6-</sup>. Oxygraph measurements show that there is no uptake of molecular oxygen during the course of reaction. The reaction proceeds through multi-step electron-proton-electron transfer mechanism, with rate limiting initial one electron transfer from NADH to HPA by outer sphere electron transfer process. Bimolecular rate constant for electron transfer reaction between NADH and PV<sub>2</sub> in phosphate buffer of pH = 6 has been determined spectrophotometrically.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new series of homo- and heteropolynuclear copper(II) complexes of N,N"-<i>bis</i>[1-biphenyl-2-hydroxyimino-2-(4-acetylanilino)-1-ethylidene]-diamines have been prepared and characterized by different physical techniques. The starting point of the research was the reaction of chloroacetyl chloride with biphenyl in the presence of aluminum chloride. 4-Biphenylhydroximoyl chloride was obtained by reacting synthesized 4-(chloroacetyl)biphenyl with alkyl nitrite. Substituted 4-(alkylaminoisonitrosoacetyl) biphenyl (ketooxime) was prepared by reacting 4-biphenylhydroximoyl chloride with 4-aminoacetophenone in EtOH. Homodi-, homotrinuclear and heterodinuclear copper(II) perchlorate complexes of tetradentate Schiff bases which possess N<sub>4</sub> donor sets derived from the condensation of 4-(arylaminoisonitrosoacetyl)biphenyl and diamine derivatives were synthesized and characterized. Elemental analysis, FT-IR, ESR, molar conductivity, magnetic moment measurements and thermal analyses studies were utilized for the investigation of the complexes. The free ligands were also characterized by <sup>1</sup>H- and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra. Elemental analyses, stoichiometric and spectroscopic data of the metal complexes indicated that the metal:ligand ratio of dinuclear copper(II) complexes were found to be 2 : 1 while this ratio was 3 : 2 in trinuclear copper(II) complexes and the metal complexes indicated that the metal ions are coordinated to the oxime and imine nitrogen atoms. The extraction abilities of the novel ligands were also evaluated in chloroform by using several transition metal picrates such as Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Hg<sup>2+</sup>. It has been observed that both ligands show a high affinity to Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The magnetic properties of Mn<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>C$_x$ and Mn<sub>5</sub>Ge<sub>3</sub>C$_x$ films prepared by magnetron cosputtering or C<sup>+</sup>-ion implantation are studied. The carbon-doped films exhibit ferromagnetic properties with Curie temperatures $T_C$ well above room temperature and metallic conductivity, making them possible candidates for future magnetic semiconductor-based devices. In Mn<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>C$_x$, the carbon gives rise to a lattice expansion and a concomitant change of the magnetic order from antiferromagnetic Mn<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub> to ferromagnetic Mn<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>C<sub>0.8</sub> with $T_C$ = 350 K. Likewise, $T_C$ of ferromagnetic Mn<sub>5</sub>Ge<sub>3</sub> is strongly enhanced in Mn<sub>5</sub>Ge<sub>3</sub>C<sub>0.8</sub>. However, in this case the lattice is slightly compressed by carbon. This demonstrates that the effect of carbon on the magnetic behaviour in these compounds is not simply due to a change of the various interatomic distances by carbon but also due to a modification of the electronic band structure.</p>

					<p>The oxidation of a number of monosubstituted aryl methyl, alkyl phenyl, dialkyl, and diphenyl sulfides by butyltriphenylphosphonium dichromate (BTPPD), to the corresponding sulfoxides, is first order with respect to BTPPD and is second order with respect to sulfide. The reaction is catalysed by hydrogen ions and the dependence is of second order. The oxidation of <i>meta</i>- and <i>para</i>-substituted aryl methyl sulfides correlated best in terms of Hammett equation, the reactions exhibited negative polar reaction constant. The <i>ortho</i>-substituted compounds correlated best in terms of Charton‚Äôs triparametric equation with negative polar constant and a small degree of steric hindrance. The oxidation of alkyl phenyl sulfides exhibited a good correlation in terms of Pavelich-Taft equation confirming that the electron-donating power of the alkyl group increases the rate, however, the reactivity is not markedly controlled by the bulkiness of the alkyl group. The rates of oxidation of sulfides were determined in nineteen organic solvents. An analysis of the solvent effect by multi-parametric equations indicated the relatively greater importance of the cation-solvating power of the solvents. A mechanism involving a single-step electrophilic oxygen transfer from BTPPD to the sulfide leading to polar transition state has been proposed.</p>

				<title>Alkylation of toluene with isopropyl alcohol over SAPO-5 catalyst</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0199-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isopropylation of toluene with isopropyl alcohol was studied over the large pore silicon alumino phosphate molecular sieves (SAPO-5) with varying Si content. Toluene conversion was found to increase with increase in the Si of the catalysts. The effect of temperature on yields of cymene was studied in the range of 453 to 553 K. The highest yield and selectivity for cymene was observed at 513 K. Good cymene selectivity was confirmed with the absence of ùëõ-propyl toluene in the product. The catalyst activity, in terms of ùëù-cymene selectivity, remained almost stable during a nine hour time on stream run. Enhanced cymene selectivity and decreased ùëù-cymene selectivity was observed with increase in the toluene to isopropyl alcohol feed mole ratio from 2 to 8. Power law model and L-H-H-W model fitted the experimental data well and are used to explain the kinetics of this reaction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A cyclic voltammetric method based on a ùõΩ-cyclodextrine doped poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was developed for the determination of levodopa. Compared with bare GCE and poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)/GCE, the poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)-ùõΩ-cyclodextrine/GCE exhibits a remarkable shift of the oxidation potentials of levodopa in the cathodic direction and a drastic enhancement of the anodic current response. The incorporation of ùõΩ-cyclodextrine into the polymer film exhibited that the electrode provides more stable and sensitive current responses for levodopa. Levodopa exhibited a single broad peak at about 0.6 V at bare GCE. However, at the ùõΩ-cyclodextrine doped poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)/GCE, a well-defined redox wave of levodopa was obtained, with the oxidation and the reduction peak potential at 0.193 and 0.164 V, respectively. The separation of peak potentials was 29 mV. The linear current response was obtained in the range of $1.0 \times  10^{-6} \sim 2.0 \sim 10^{-4}$ M with a detection limit of $4.18 \sim 10^{-7}$ M for levodopa, The poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)-ùõΩ-cyclodextrine/GCE was also effective to simultaneously detect levodopa and ascorbic acid. The modified electrode has been successfully applied for the determination of levodopa in pharmaceuticals. The poly(2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid)-ùõΩ-cyclodextrine/GCE showed excellent stability and reproducibility.</p>

				<title>Linear sweep voltammetric studies on the supramolecular complex of alizarin red S with lysozyme and determination of lysozyme</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0217-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An electrochemical method for the determination of lysozyme (LYS) based on its interaction with alizarin red S (ARS) was established by linear sweep voltammetry in this paper. The electrochemical behaviour of ARS with LYS was investigated on a dropping mercury working electrode in 0.2 mol/L pH 4.8 Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffer solution. ARS showed a sensitive second order derivative linear sweep voltammetric reductive peak at -0.42 V (vs SCE). After the addition of LYS, the reductive peak current of ARS decreased without the shift of the reductive peak potential and no new waves appeared, which was due to the formation of a supramolecular complex of ARS with LYS in the solution. The stoichiometry of the ARS-LYS complex was further calculated by the electrochemical data with the results of the binding ratio as 3 : 1 and the binding constant as $2.82 \times 10^{14}$. Under the selected conditions, the decrease of the second order derivative linear sweep voltammetric reductive peak current of ARS was in proportion to the LYS concentration in the range from 0.8 to 35.0 mg/L and the detection limit of LYS was calculated as 0.52 mg/L (3ùúé). Different kinds of LYS samples were detected satisfactorily with this method.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nitrogen (N)-doped carbon (CN$_x$) nanotubes were synthesized by pyrolysis of ethylenediamine with Ni<sub>1.07</sub>Mg<sub>1.01</sub>AlO<sub>3.58</sub>, Ni<sub>1.99</sub>Mg<sub>0.29</sub>AlO<sub>3.78</sub>, and Ni<sub>2.31</sub>Mg<sub>0.08</sub>AlO<sub>3.89</sub> mixed oxides as catalysts at 650&#176;C. Those mixed oxides were obtained by calcination of corresponding layered double hydroxide precursors (LDHs). Structure and composition of LDHs and mixed oxides were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Inductively coupled plasma spectrum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope were used to characterize the N content, proportion of pyridine-like N structure and morphology of CN$_x$ nanotubes. The results showed that the tubes grown with Ni<sub>2.31</sub>Mg<sub>0.08</sub>AlO<sub>3.89</sub> as catalysts had more obvious bamboo-like structure, larger diameter than those grown with Ni<sub>1.07</sub>Mg<sub>1.01</sub>AlO<sub>3.58</sub> and Ni<sub>1.99</sub>Mg<sub>0.29</sub>AlO<sub>3.78</sub>. The N content and proportion of graphitic-like N structures increased with the content of Ni<sup>2+</sup> increasing in LDH precursors. The morphology, N content and pyridine-like N structures for CN$_x$ nanotubes can be controlled to a certain extent by varying the content of Ni<sup>2+</sup> in LDH precursors.</p>

				<title>Quest for new materials: Inorganic chemistry plays a crucial role</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0235-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is an endless quest for new materials to meet the demands of advancing technology. Thus, we need new magnetic and metallic/semiconducting materials for spintronics, new low-loss dielectrics for telecommunication, new multi-ferroic materials that combine both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for memory devices, new piezoelectrics that do not contain lead, new lithium containing solids for application as cathode/anode/electrolyte in lithium batteries, hydrogen storage materials for mobile/transport applications and catalyst materials that can convert, for example, methane to higher hydrocarbons, and the list is endless! Fortunately for us, chemistry - inorganic chemistry in particular - plays a crucial role in this quest. Most of the functional materials mentioned above are inorganic non-molecular solids, while much of the conventional inorganic chemistry deals with isolated molecules or molecular solids. Even so, the basic concepts that we learn in inorganic chemistry, for example, acidity/basicity, oxidation/reduction (potentials), crystal field theory, low spin-high spin/inner sphere-outer sphere complexes, role of ùëë-electrons in transition metal chemistry, electron-transfer reactions, coordination geometries around metal atoms, Jahn-Teller distortion, metal-metal bonds, cation-anion (metal-nonmetal) redox competition in the stabilization of oxidation states - all find crucial application in the design and synthesis of inorganic solids possessing technologically important properties. An attempt has been made here to illustrate the role of inorganic chemistry in this endeavour, drawing examples from the literature as well as from the research work of my group.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction of 1,3-diaryltriazenes (abbreviated in general as HL-R, where R stands for the <i>para</i>-substituent in the aryl fragment and H stands for the dissociable hydrogen atom, R = OCH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>, H, Cl, NO<sub>2</sub>) with [Rh(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CO)Cl] in ethanol in the presence of NEt<sub>3</sub> produces a series of trisdiaryltriazenide complexes of rhodium of type [Rh(L-R)<sub>3</sub>], where the triazenes are coordinated to rhodium as monoanionic, bidentate N,N-donors. Structure of the [Rh(L-OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The complexes are diamagnetic, and show characteristic <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals and intense MLCT transitions in the visible region. They also fluoresce in the visible region under ambient condition while excited at around 400 nm. Cyclic voltammetry on these complexes shows a Rh(III)-Rh(IV) oxidation (within $0.84-1.67$ V vs SCE), followed by an oxidation of the coordinated triazene ligand (except the R = NO<sub>2</sub> complex). An irreversible reduction of the coordinated triazene is also observed for all the complexes below $-1.03$ V vs SCE.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of aqueous cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate with the anion of succinimide (sucH) in the presence of excess ethylenediamine (en) in air results in the formation of a dinuclear complex ùúá-peroxo-<i>bis</i>[<i>bis</i>(ethylenediamine)succinimidato-cobalt(III)] dinitrate dihydrate, <b>1</b>, in good yield. Compound <b>1</b> was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, visible spectra and magnetic susceptibility studies. The explosive nature of [Co(en)<sub>2</sub>(suc)(ùúá-O<sub>2</sub>)Co(en)<sub>2</sub>(suc)](NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, <b>1</b>, precluded its thermal characterization. Compound <b>1</b> crystallises in the monoclinic space group $P2_1/c$ and a half of the molecule, constitutes its asymmetric unit. In the centrosymmetric dinuclear complex <b>1</b>, two Co(III) centres are linked by a planar peroxide bridge. Each cobalt atom is surrounded by four nitrogen atoms of ethylenediamine ligands, a nitrogen atom of succinimidato anion and an oxygen atom of peroxo bridge resulting in a slightly distorted {CoN<sub>5</sub>O} octahedron. Due to steric hindrance between the two Co(III) centres, the peroxide bridge is planar with a Co-O-O-Co torsion angle of 180&#176;. The dinuclear complex cation, the nitrate anion and the lattice water are involved in three varieties of H-bonding interactions namely N-H$\cdots$O, O-H$\cdots$O and C-H$\cdots$O.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0275-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of Ru(III) catalysed oxidation of L-lysine by diperiodatoargentate (III) (DPA) in alkaline medium at 298 K and a constant ionic strength of 0.50 mol dm-3 was studied spectrophotometrically. The oxidation products are aldehyde (5-aminopentanal) and Ag (I). The stoichiometry is i.e. [L-lysine] : [DPA] = 1 : 1. The reaction is of first order in [Ru(III)] and [DPA] and is less than unit order in both [L-lys] and [alkali]. Addition of periodate had a retarding effect on the reaction. The oxidation reaction in alkaline medium has been shown to proceed via a Ru(III)-L-lysine complex, which further reacts with one molecule of monoperiodatoargentate(III) (MPA) in a rate determining step followed by other fast steps to give the products. The main products were identified by spot test, IR, GC-MS studies. The activation parameters with respect to slow step of the mechanism are computed and discussed and thermodynamic quantities are also determined. The active species of catalyst and oxidant have been identified.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lanthanum-substituted strontium-oxybritholites, Sr$_{10-x}$La$_x$(PO<sub>4</sub>)$_{6-x}$(SiO<sub>4</sub>)$_{x}$O with $x = 0$, 2 and 4, prepared by solid state reaction were investigated by chemical analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, Raman and <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR spectroscopies. The refinements of powder XRD patterns of the substituted compounds by the Rietveld method showed that the lanthanum occupied the two metal sites, i.e. (4f) and (6h) sites into the apatite structure, with a clear preference for the (6h) sites. A progressive shift of the free oxygen O(4) towards the centre of the triangles formed by the metal-atoms in the (6h) positions was observed when the lanthanum content increased. It led to the formation of a Sr/La(2)-O(4) strong bond, which might have increased the stability of these compounds. The bands of Raman spectra were assigned to the vibration modes of PO<sub>4</sub> and SiO<sub>4</sub> groups. The comparison of the results of <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR analysis with those obtained with the <sup>31</sup>P previously reported, suggested that both species occupied the same crystallographic sites.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0309-0315</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements have been carried out on 9,9'-bianthryl in three imidazolium ionic liquids to probe the excited state dynamics. In the early time-scale, the fluorescence spectra of bianthryl have been found to consist of emission from both locally excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) states. The LE ‚Üí CT relaxation time, as estimated from the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the LE emission, is found to vary between 230 and 390 ps, while the average solvent relaxation time, as estimated from the analysis of time-dependent fluorescence Stokes shift, is found to vary between 620 ps and 1840 ps, depending on the viscosity of the ionic liquids. The results confirm that while in conventional less viscous solvents the CT formation kinetics of bianthryl occurs simultaneously with the solvation dynamics, in ionic liquids the two processes mostly occur in different time scales.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mesoporous titania was synthesized by a sol-gel method using the surfactants Span85 and X114 as the template. The pore structure was determined by the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption method below 73 K and calculated using the BJH model. TEM characterizations show that the pores are formed through particle accumulation. Two kinds of channels, straight channels made of cylindrical capillaries and curved channels made of slit-shaped pores, exist in the bulk materials. The influence of the pore structure of mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> on its photocatalytic performance was studied. The sample with higher porosity, better textural properties and straight channels are good for photocatalytic performance.</p>

					<p>Versatile methods were employed to investigate the chemical reactivity of hydrogenterminated surface of silicon nanowires. The experimental results showed that coupling reaction took place when silicon nanowires reacted with 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl acrylate, and reductive deposition reaction occurred in the presence of inorganic salt such as HgCl<sub>2</sub>, and also co-reduction reaction took place in a solution containing both AuCl<sub>3</sub> and PdCl<sub>2</sub>.

				<title>Temperature dependence studies on the electro-oxidation of aliphatic alcohols with modified platinum electrodes</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0329-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature dependence on the electro-oxidation of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> were investigated with Pt and PtRu electrodes. Tafel slope and apparent activation energy were evaluated from the cyclic voltammetric data in the low potential region ($0.3-0.5$ V vs SHE). The CV results provided Tafel slopes for alcohols in the range of 200-400 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> which indicated a difference in the rate determining step. The decrease in Tafel slope was only observed in the case of methanol for the Ru-modified Pt electrode. This indicates that Ru improves the rate of determining step for methanol while hindering it for the other alcohols. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was also used to evaluate the electro-oxidation mechanism of alcohols on these electrodes. The simulated EIS results provided two important parameters: charge transfer resistance ($R_{ct}$) and inductance (ùêø). The $R^{-1}_{ct}$ and $L^{-1}$ represent the rate of alcohol electro-oxidation and rate of desorption of intermediate species, respectively. These values increased with the increasing of temperature. The results from two techniques were well agreed that the electro-oxidation of methanol was improved by raising the temperature and ruthenium modification.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrochemical behaviour of a series of Schiff base i.e. 3-[5-phenylpyrazol-3-ylimino]indol-2-ones (IIa-e) synthesized by the reaction of various 5-substituted isatins with 3-amino-5-phenyl-pyrazole has been investigated and compared with corresponding isatin in dimethylformamide in 0.1 M LiCl using cyclic voltammetry at Hanging Mercury Drop Electrode. All synthesized Schiff bases exhibit a single irreversible two-electron reduction wave in contrast with the two discrete one-electron transfer reduction waves observed for isatin in this medium. Observation of a well-developed single reduction wave can be attributed to the higher basicity of the nitrogen species of the imine bond of Schiff bases, making proton abstraction as well as second electron transfer both rapid. The compounds are subjected to constant potential preparative electrolysis. The products are identified as secondary amines by spectroscopic methods. A mechanism for the electro-reduction process has been proposed. Kinetic parameters have also been calculated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Studies on surface reactivity of substrate iron (Fe-particles) were made in the tribo-chemical environment of alkyl octadecenoates. Two alkyl octadecenoates namely ethyl octadecenoate and methyl 12-hydroxy octadecenoate, slightly different in their chemical nature, were taken for preparing the chemisorbed reaction films (CRF) at the temperature $100 \pm 5^\circ$C. The reaction products collected in the composite (amorphous) phase were isolated into three different solvent-soluble fractions (sub-layer films) using polar solvents of increasing polar strength. The FTIR analysis of these films showed that these were primarily organic in nature and were composed of alkyl and/or aryl hydroxy ethers, unsaturated hydroxy ketones, and aromatic structures chemically linked with iron surface. These reaction films also contained large amount of iron (Fe). Further, these film fractions also showed varying thermal behaviour during thermal decomposition in the temperature range of $50-800^\circ$C when thermally evaluated in the nitrogen environment.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0361-0367</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kirkwood-Buff (K-B) integrals play an important role in characterizing the intermolecular interactions in liquid mixtures. These are represented by the K-B parameters, $G_{\text{AA}}$, $G_{\text{BB}}$, and $G_{\text{AB}}$, which reflect correlation between like-like and like-unlike species in the mixture. The K-B integrals of binary mixtures of acetonitrile (ACN) with formamide (FA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylacetamide (NMA) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) at 298.15 K and at atmospheric pressure have been computed from the experimental data of ultrasonic speed and density. We have used the similar inverse procedure (as proposed by Ben-Naim) to compute the K-B Parameters of the mixtures, in which thermodynamic information on mixtures such as partial molar volumes, isothermal compressibility, and experimental data of partial vapour pressures are used. A new route has been incorporated by using regular solution theory in the computation of excess free energy for obtaining the partial vapour pressures of binary liquid mixtures. The low values of excess entropy ($S^E \approx 0$) obtained for these mixtures indicate the applicability of regular solution theory to these mixtures. The results obtained regarding intermolecular interaction in all the four mixtures under study from this new procedure are in good agreement with those obtained from the trends exhibited by the excess functions of these mixtures.</p>

					<p>A series of water soluble Keggin type heteropolyoxotungstates have been tested as oxidation catalysts in aqueous-biphasic media with dilute H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (30&#37;) as the oxygen atom donor, without using any phase transfer agent.

The functionalities that undergo oxidations are: organic sulfides, pyridines, anilines, benzyl alcohols and benzyl halides. The oxidations of sulfides to sulfoxides and/or sulfones have been studied in detail, and a simple kinetic model consisting of two consecutive reactions, is shown to give good fit with the experimental data. In the catalytic system described here product isolation is easy, and the aqueous catalyst solution can be re-used several times with little loss in its efficiency.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction of 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenol with [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl] in refluxing ethanol in the presence of a base (NEt3) affords an organoiridium complex of type [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)(H)], where L represents the coordinated 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenolate ligand. A similar reaction carried out in toluene affords the [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)(H)] complex along with a similar complex of type [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)Cl]. Structures of both the [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)(H)] and [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)Cl] complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In both the complexes, 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenol is coordinated to iridium, via C-H activation at the 2' position of the naphthyl ring, as a dianionic tridentate C, N, O-donor and the two triphenylphosphines are <i>trans</i>. The organoiridium complexes show intense MLCT transitions in the visible region. Cyclic voltammetry on the [Ir(PPh3)2(L)(H)] and [Ir(PPh3)2(L)Cl] complexes shows a reversible Ir(III)-Ir(IV) oxidation respectively at 0.55 and 0.73 V vs SCE. An irreversible oxidation of the coordinated 2-(naphthyl-1'-azo)-4-methylphenolate ligand is observed above 1.0 V vs SCE and an irreversible reduction of the same is observed near $-1.0$ V vs SCE.</p>

					<p>A novel polypyridyl ligand phenyl-(4,5,9,14-tetraaza-benzo[ùëè]triphenylen-1,1-$yl$)-methanone (PTBM) and its complexes [Ru(phen)<sub>2</sub>(PTBM)]<sup>2+</sup> (<b>1</b>) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) and [Ru(bpy)<sub>2</sub> (PTBM)]<sup>2+</sup> (<b>2</b>) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, and <sup>1</sup>H NMR. The DNA-binding properties of the two complexes were investigated by spectroscopic and viscosity measurements. The results indicate that both complexes bind to DNA via an intercalative mode and the DNA-binding affinity of complex <b>1</b> is greater than that of complex <b>2</b>. When irradiated at 365 nm, complex <b>1</b> was found to be a more-effective DNA-cleaving agent than complex <b>2</b>.</p>

				<page>0471-0479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New substituted trichostatic acid derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities towards the H661 non-small lung cancer cell line. These syntheses were achieved by alkylation of propiophenones to introduce the side chain with a terminal precursor of hydroxamic acid and aminobenzamide derivatives. The first fluorinated derivatives of trichostatic acid are described, such as 6-fluoro trichostatin A, with antiproliferative activities in the micromolar range and with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity.</p>

				<title>Collagen-curcumin interaction - A physico-chemical study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0509-0514</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Curcumin is a widely used therapeutic agent with a wide spectrum of biological and physiological applications like wound healing and interacts with the skin protein, collagen. This work reports the effect of curcumin on various physico-chemical properties of collagen. The results suggest that significant changes in viscosity and surface tension occur on collagen interacting with curcumin. Secondary structure analysis using circular dichroism shows that curcumin does not alter the triple helical structure of collagen. Increasing concentration of curcumin resulted in aggregation of the protein. Further, curcumin imparts high level of thermal stability to collagen with shrinkage temperature of collagen increasing from 60 to 90&#176;C.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was applied for quantitatively analysing a series of binary mixtures and a ternary mixture. Binary mixtures having different weight ratios of two components, ùëö-aminophenol and m-nitroaniline, were investigated by THz-TDS in the range of 0.3 to 1.5 THz, and it was found that the absorption coefficients of the components in each mixture were linearly proportional to their concentrations in the mixture. The results from analysis were in agreement with actual values with a relative error of less than 7&#37;. The quantitative method will help in the detection of illegal drugs, poisons and dangerous materials that are wrapped or mixed with other materials.</p>

				<title>Solution structure of loperamide and ùõΩ-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes using NMR spectroscopy</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Loperamide (LPR) is a synthetic, poorly water soluble, peripherally acting opiate agonist drug used for the treatment of diarrhea. Major challenges in formulating this drug for clinical applications include solubility enhancement and improved stability in biological systems. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are chiral, truncated cone shaped; cyclic oligosaccharides that can encapsulate a variety of poorly water soluble drug molecules into inclusion complexes, thereby increasing their stability and solubility. <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopic studies showed the inclusion complexation between ùõΩ-CD and LPR, based on the upfield shift changes in the ùõΩ-CD cavity protons (H-3' and H-5') and downfield shift changes in the guest (LPR) protons. 2D COSY spectral data was used for assignment of ùõΩ-CD as well as LPR protons and 2D ROESY spectral data to know the inclusion of LPR inside the ùõΩ-CD cavity. The 1 : 1 stoichiometry and overall association constant ($K_a$) were determined by using Scott‚Äôs plot method to be 68.805 M<sup>-1</sup>. 2D ROESY spectral data suggest that the inclusion of aromatic rings of LPR in ùõΩ-CD cavity can be from narrower as well as the wider rim side and the six possible 1 : 1 LPR : ùõΩ-CD inclusion complexes have been proposed. Thus, we anticipate that complexation of LPR with ùõΩ-CD would increase its solubility and stability in biological system.</p>

				<title>Guest-host interactions in the alkaline bleaching of triphenylmethane dyes catalysed by ùõΩ-cyclodextrin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0529-0534</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rates of alkaline bleaching of triphenylmethane dyes crystal violet (CV), malachite green (MG) and rosaniline (RA) have been measured spectrophotometrically in an aqueous medium at 30&#176;C in the presence of ùõΩ-cyclodextrin (CD). At lower concentrations of CD, CV forms productive 1 : 1 (G : H) complex. At higher concentrations of CD, it forms unproductive 1 : 2 (G : H) complex. For the bleaching of MG, CD accelerates or decelerates the rate depending on pH of the medium by forming 1 : 1 (G : H) inclusion complex. Analysis of rate data shows that MG undergoes fading by mixed order process. CD decelerates the water reaction and accelerates hydroxide ion reaction. In the case of RA, both water reaction as well as hydroxide ion reaction are retarded by CD by the formation of inclusion complex.</p>

					<p>The rate of glucose equivalent production in C<sub>4</sub> green plants is investigated as a function of the intercellular partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>, so as to find the precise physical chemistry of photosynthesis. Expressions are first formulated for the dependence of photochemical efficiency and of rubisco activation on pressure. Then a pressure-dependent rate law is derived. The latter is successfully tested for two specific C<sub>4</sub> plants, namely, <i>Panicum antidotale and Panicum coloratum</i>.</p>

				<title>Test of theoretical models for ultrafast heterogeneous electron transfer with femtosecond two-photon photoemission data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0561-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The energy distribution of electrons injected into acceptor states on the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> was measured with femtosecond two-photon photoemission. Shape and relative energetic position of these distribution curves with respect to the corresponding donor states, i.e. of perylene chromophores in the first excited singlet state attached via different bridge-anchor groups to the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface, were compared with the predictions of different theoretical models for light-induced ultrafast heterogeneous electron transfer (HET). Gerischer‚Äôs early scenario for light-induced HET was considered and two recent explicit calculations, i.e. a fully quantum mechanical analytical model and a time-dependent density functional theory model based on molecular dynamics simulations for the vibrational modes were also considered. Based on the known vibrational structure in the photoionization spectrum of perylene in the gas phase and that measured in the linear absorption spectra of the perylene chromophores anchored on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface the energy distribution curves for the injected electrons were fitted assuming the excitation of the dominant 0.17 eV vibrational mode in the ionized perylene chromophore leading to a corresponding Franck-Condon dictated progression in the energy distribution curves. Each individual peak was fitted with a Voigt profile where the Lorentzian contribution was taken from the time-resolved HET data and the Gaussian contribution attributed to inhomogeneous broadening. The measured room temperature energy distribution curves for the injected electrons are explained with the fully quantum mechanical model for light-induced HET with the high energy, 0.17 eV, skeletal stretching mode excited in the ionized perylene chromophore. The corresponding energy distribution of the injected electrons is fully accommodated in acceptor states on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface fulfilling the wide band limit.</p>

				<title>Generalized Warburg impedance on realistic self-affine fractals: Comparative study of statistically corrugated and isotropic roughness</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0579-0588</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyse the problem of impedance for a diffusion controlled charge transfer process across an irregular interface. These interfacial irregularities are characterized as two class of random fractals: (i) a statistically isotropic self-affine fractals and (ii) a statistically corrugated self-affine fractals. The information about the realistic fractal surface roughness has been introduced through the bandlimited power-law power spectrum over limited wave numbers. The details of power spectrum of such roughness can be characterized in term of four fractal morphological parameters, viz. fractal dimension ($D_H$), lower ($\ell$), and upper (ùêø) cut-off length scales of fractality, and the proportionality factor (ùúá) of power spectrum. Theoretical results are analysed for the impedance of such rough electrode as well as the effect of statistical symmetries of roughness. Impedance response for irregular interface is simplified through expansion over intermediate frequencies. This intermediate frequency expansion with sufficient number of terms offers a good approximation over all frequency regimes. The Nyquist plots of impedance show the strong dependency mainly on three surface morphological parameters i.e. $D_H$, $\ell$ and ùúá. We can say that our theoretical results also provide an alternative explanation for the exponent in intermediate frequency power-law form.</p>

					<p>Electron transfer from a molecular level to empty continuum levels of a substrate is described theoretically. Using a quasicontinuum approach to model the substrate, analytical expressions pertaining to the time-dependent probability among the various levels of the substrate is presented along with its extension to coherently excited molecular vibrational modes. Hidden time scales and dynamics are revealed in the analysis and possible experiments to observe the new results are suggested.

					<p>The partition function for one-dimensional nearest neighbour Ising models is estimated by summing all the energy terms in the Hamiltonian for N sites. The algebraic expression for the partition function is then employed to deduce the eigenvalues of the basic $2 \times 2$ matrix and the corresponding Hermitian Toeplitz matrix is derived using the Discrete Fourier Transform.

				<title>Simulation for memory effect of Fick‚Äôs first law</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0601-0605</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The memory effect of the Fick‚Äôs first law, expressed by $\tau(\partial J/\partial t$) = $-J$ - Dgradc, was confirmed by means of the 3D Monte Carlo simulation, where ùúè is the relaxation time, ùêΩ is the flux of the diffusing particles, ùê∑ is the diffusion coefficient, and ùëê is the concentration of the particles. The delay has been observed by chronoamperometry at a pair electrode. It behaves as if it were due to a slow electron transfer reaction. A diffusion model was composed of two cubic cells with different volumes in contact with each other by their faces, which worked as the boundary for the flux. Each cell contained one diffusing particle and solvent molecules for a given concentration. The particle moved randomly in the 3D lattice until it traversed the boundary. The number of the random steps before the traverse was equivalent to the relaxation time. It was proportional to ca 2/3 powers of the number of solvent molecules or was inversely proportional to 0.63 powers of the concentration. The relaxation time was roughly equivalent to the lapse of taking for the particle to visit every lattice site impartially.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We focus attention on two equivalent forms of Graham‚Äôs law of diffusion that is valid for an ideal gas mixture. This equivalence is shown to be lost by the empirical equations of state in presence of an attractive nonideality. The modified forms are noted. We then construct a simple quantum mechanical model to simulate these results and obtain a one-to-one correspondence. We see how these equations of interest may be extended to ùê∑-dimensions. By employing the quantum model, we next observe the equivalence of the results found above with those obtained via statistical mechanics. As an added advantage, we demonstrate that the virial theorem for confined quantum stationary states retains its validity in the statistical domain too, though here the averaging scheme is correspondingly different.</p>

				<page>0629-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lyotropic liquid crystalline phases formed by surfactants are of special importance due to their close resemblance to biological systems. The redox reactions in such ordered media are of fundamental interest in understanding several complex processes occurring in the biological media, where the former can act as model systems. In this work, we have carried out the redox reactions of benzoquinone| hydroquinone, methyl viologen and ferrocenemethanol probes in a lyotropic hexagonal columnar phase (H1 phase) using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. The liquid crystalline phase we have studied is made up of the non-ionic surfactant, Triton X-100 and water. Polarizing optical microscopic examination confirmed that the columnar hexagonal phase is retained even after the addition of redox probe as well as the supporting electrolyte. Our studies show a significant shift in the half-peak potentials of the redox probes in the H1 phase as compared to the solvent phase. The diffusion coefficient values for different redox probes in the H1 phase were also found to be significantly reduced when compared to the corresponding solvent media.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>RuO<sub>2</sub> thin layers were deposited on Ti supports by thermal decomposition of RuCl<sub>3</sub> at 400&#176;C. Some of the samples were subjected to laser irradiation between 0.5 and 1.5 J cm<sup>-2</sup>. Some others to Kr bombardment with doses between 10<sup>15</sup> and 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. Modifications introduced by the surface treatments were monitored by cyclic voltammetry and O<sub>2</sub> evolution in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution. The voltammetric charge increased with surface treatment almost to the same extent for irradiation and bombardment. The electrocatalytic activity turned out much higher for Kr bombarded samples. Raw experimental data were scrutinized in an attempt to separate geometric from electronic factors. True electrocatalytic effects are clearly seen to prevail over purely surface area effects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) employing a poly (vinyl alcohol) hydrogel membrane electrolyte (PHME) is reported. The DBFC employs an AB<sub>5</sub> Misch metal alloy as anode and a goldplated stainless steel mesh as cathode in conjunction with aqueous alkaline solution of sodium borohydride as fuel and aqueous acidified solution of hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. Room temperature performances of the PHME-based DBFC in respect of peak power outputs; <i>ex-situ</i> cross-over of oxidant, fuel, anolyte and catholyte across the membrane electrolytes; utilization efficiencies of fuel and oxidant, as also cell performance durability are compared with a similar DBFC employing a Nafion&#174;-117 membrane electrolyte (NME). Peak power densities of ‚àº30 and ‚àº40 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> are observed for the DBFCs with PHME and NME, respectively. The crossover of NaBH<sub>4</sub> across both the membranes has been found to be very low. The utilization efficiencies of NaBH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are found to be ‚àº24 and ‚àº59&#37;, respectively for the PHME-based DBFC; ‚àº18 and ‚àº62&#37;, respectively for the NME-based DBFC. The PHME and NME-based DBFCs exhibit operational cell potentials of &#8764; 1.2 and &#8764; 1.4 V, respectively at a load current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> for ‚àº100 h.</p>

				<title>Platinum-carbon black-titanium dioxide nanocomposite electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0655-0664</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New-generation Pt/C-TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite electrocatalysts for fuel cells, prepared by a heterogeneous photocatalytic method, have been characterized using techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Importantly, galvanostatic data confirm the superior stability of these materials against corrosion under anodic polarization conditions relative to commercial benchmark fuel cell electrocatalysts. EIS spectra from ETEK 5, SIDCAT 405 and SIDCAT 410 membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were fit to a Randles equivalent circuit with a Warburg element to show the presence of O<sub>2</sub> transport limitation arising from the use of thicker electrodes (lower Pt loading on carbon). The use of a constant phase element (CPE) instead of pure capacitor was justified from the fit procedure as CPE represents the porous electrode system more precisely with its distributive elements. EIS spectra from Tanaka, SIDCAT 451 and SIDCAT 452 MEAs (thinner electrodes) were fit to a Randles circuit with a pure capacitor and no Warburg element. The use of a transmission line model for fitting these data independently provided information about the catalyst layer resistance while all other parameters matched well with that of the Randles circuit. The effective proton transport in cathodes was quantified using polarization data for both classes of MEAs. Trends in the previously reported performance of MEAs prepared using these electrocatalysts were justified based on the relative contributions of kinetic, Ohmic and mass transfer losses to the overall overpotential, which in turn were estimated from impedance and polarization data analyses.</p>

				<page>0675-0683</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrochemical reduction of hydrogen peroxide is studied on a sand-blasted stainless steel (SSS) electrode in an aqueous solution of NaClO<sub>4</sub>. The cyclic voltammetric reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at low concentrations is characterized by a cathodic peak at $-0.40$ V versus standard calomel electrode (SCE). Cyclic voltammetry is studied by varying the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the range from 0.2 mM to 20 mM and the sweep rate in the range from 2 to 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. Voltammograms at concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> higher than 2 mM or at high sweep rates consist of an additional current peak, which may be due to the reduction of adsorbed species formed during the reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Amperometric determination of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at $-0.50$ V vs SCE provides the detection limit of 5 ùúáM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A plot of current density versus concentration has two segments suggesting a change in the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduction at concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#8805; 2 mM.

				<abstract>
					<p>Electrodeposition of BaCO<sub>3</sub> from aminecarboxylate stabilized-Ba(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> baths, results in oriented crystallization when the bath conditions promote the decomposition of the Ba complex. Crystal growth is predominant along the ùëê-crystallographic axis. The crystallites orient themselves with their ùëê-axis normal to the substrate. The crystallites exhibit three-fold twinning (trilling) consequent to the evolution of the {110} planes as planes of reflection. Pairs of trillings are seen to grow about a four-sided polygon formed by the {010} crystal faces whose centre is a point of inversion.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0693-0701</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The electrochemistry of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) prepared from 2-mercaptopyridine (2 Mpy) and 4-mercaptopyridine (4 Mpy) dissolved in either water or an aqueous solution of 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> on a polycrystalline gold electrode has been investigated in an aqueous electrolyte solution (0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) using cyclic voltammetry. Results suggest that 2 Mpy is adsorbed more strongly than 4 Mpy due to the formation of a S-Au-N chelate. The under- and over-potential deposition of copper from an aqueous solution of 0.1 M sulphuric acid is inhibited in the presence of these SAMs suggesting strong interactions between these adsorbates and the gold surface. A copper adlayer was partially displaced by adsorbing 2 Mpy and 4 Mpy. The inhibition effect of these SAMs on the corrosion of C60 steel has been investigated using electrochemical impedance measurements (EIM) in an aqueous 3.5 wt&#37; NaCl solution. The polarization resistance and the inhibition efficiency were calculated. 2 Mpy has higher inhibition efficiency than 4 Mpy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A co-planar electrode device, fabricated with all electrodes (working, counter and reference) on the same face of a Nafion&#174; polymer electrolyte membrane, is proposed for the amperometric detection of gaseous methanol using Pt as the working electrode. Clear voltammetry is obtained for methanol oxidation from its vapours in equilibrium with methanol aqueous solutions, both in the absence and presence of oxygen in the gas stream. Using an appropriate pulse sequence to keep the indicator electrode active, methanol vapours in the 1-13 Torr partial pressure range (in equilibrium with methanol aqueous solutions in the 1-10&#37; w/w concentration range) could be determined, in a constant potential, amperometric mode. The methanol detector could be operated both in a nitrogen stream and (in what is essential for practical applications) in an air atmosphere too, with estimated detection limits of 1.2 and 1.4 Torr respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The phenosafranine adsorbed onto the micro and mesoporous materials prepared by ion exchange method and interaction of the dye with host materials were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to elucidate the influence of the host matrix on the binding energy of N 1s orbital. Core level N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the interaction between the dye and the solid surface through the hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen atoms of primary amino groups in dye molecule and the oxygen atom of surface hydroxyl groups. The strength of the hydrogen bonding depends on the nature of the solid surface. In the dye adsorbed onto the micro and mesoporous materials the interaction between adsorbed phenosafranine and the surfaces of the porous materials are found to modify the optical spectra and the excited state dynamics of the confined phenosafranine molecules. The change in photophysical properties of phenosafranine adsorbed on to the host materials on dehydration at elevated temperatures is attributed to the modification of host surface during dehydration process.</p>

				<title>Imaging hydrogen oxidation activity of catalyst-coated perfluoro sulfonic acid-polymer electrolyte membranes using Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0719-0725</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) is a unique technique for studying fast heterogeneous kinetics and to map reactivity gradients along the surface of an electrocatalyst, especially when it involves multiple surface sites of varying reactivity. It combines the dual advantages offered by ultramicroelectrode (UME) voltammetry in terms of reduced ohmic drop and insignificant double layer charging contribution with the advantages of imaging by rastering the UME across an electro-active surface. In this work, we demonstrate these distinctive features of SECM in evaluating reactivity gradients on catalyst (Pt/C) coated Nafion&#174; films towards hydrogen oxidation activity, a reaction of immense technological relevance. Imaging has been performed in the feedback mode by allowing H<sub>2</sub> evolution at the tip (25 ùúám Pt UME), which is reoxidized at the substrate electrode containing Pt/C-Nafion film. Interesting distribution in H<sub>2</sub> oxidation activity has been observed as a function of potential applied to the Pt/CNafion film. In addition, a plot of normalized tip current versus the substrate electrode potential indicates the effect of potential-induced reactivity change in the catalyst-coated membranes. The results of the present investigation are believed to be useful to H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> PEM fuel cells with respect to evaluating reactivity gradients of catalyst-coated polymer electrolyte membranes, which is important to rectify problems related to catalyst utilization.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polymer electrolytes are known to possess excellent physicochemical properties that are very useful for electrochemical energy systems. The mobility in polymer electrolytes is understood to be mainly due to the segmental motion of polymer chains and the ion transport is generally restricted to the amorphous phase of the polymer. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) that are formed using plastizicers and polymers along with ionic salts are known to exhibit liquid-like ionic conductivity while maintaining the dimensional stability of a solid matrix. In the present study, the preparation and characterization of poly(vinyl alcohol)-based hydrogel membranes (PHMEs) as electrolytes for electrochemical capacitors have been reported. Varying HClO<sub>4</sub> dopant concentration leads to different characteristics of the capacitors. The EC comprising PHME doped with 2 M HClO<sub>4</sub> and black pearl carbon (BPC) electrodes has been found to exhibit a maximum specific capacitance value of 97 F g<sup>-1</sup>, a phase angle value of 78&#176;, and a maximum charge-discharge coulombic efficiency of 88&#37;.</p>

The MTMOS silicate sol-gel embedded Au<sub>73</sub>Ag<sub>27</sub> core-shell nanoparticles modified electrode showed better synergistic electrocatalytic effect towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide when compared to monometal MTMOS-Au<sub>nps</sub> and MTMOS-Ag<sub>nps</sub> modified electrodes. These modified electrodes were studied without immobilizing any enzyme in the MTMOS sol-gel matrix.

				<abstract>
					<p>Structure transitions between copper UPD adlayers on Au(111)-($1 \times  1$) in sulfuric acid and chloride containing electrolyte were investigated by in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate that co-adsorbed sulphate ions in the ($\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$)R30&#176; UPD adlayer are replaced by chloride ions and, depending on the halide coverage, a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) or a slightly distorted ($5 \times 5$)-like Cu-Cl UPD adlayer are formed. The stability ranges of these phases are controlled both by the electrode potential and the Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration. Phase transitions between the three UPD phases were monitored by time-resolved <i>in situ</i> STM. The observed structure details were attributed to mechanisms based on two-dimensional nucleation and growth processes.</p>

In this paper, we present a critical analysis of the distance dependence of FRET, and try to illustrate the non-$R^{-6}$ type behaviour of the rate for the case of transfer from a localized electronic excitation on the donor, a dye molecule to three different energy acceptors with delocalized electronic excitations namely, graphene, a two-dimensional semiconducting sheet and the case of such a semiconducting sheet rolled to obtain a nanotube. We use simple analytic models to understand the distance dependence in each case.</p>

				<title>Nonadiabatic quantum wave packet dynamics of the H + H<sub>2</sub> reaction including the coriolis coupling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0789-0795</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of coriolis coupling on the dynamics of H + H<sub>2</sub> reaction is examined by calculating the initial state-selected and energy resolved reaction probabilities on the coupled manifold of its degenerate $2p$ ($E'$) ground electronic state. H<sub>3</sub> in this state is prone to the Jahn-Teller (JT) instability and consequently the degeneracy is split upon distortion from its $D_{3h}$ equilibrium geometry. The orbital degeneracy is, however, restored along the $D_{3h}$ symmetry configuration and it results into conical intersections of the two JT split component states. The energetically lower adiabatic component of latter is repulsive, and mainly (`rather solely‚Äô) drive the H + H<sub>2</sub> reaction dynamics. On the otherhand, the upper adiabatic component is of bound type and can only impart non-adiabaticity on the dynamics of lower state. Comparison calculations are therefore also carried out on the uncoupled lower adiabatic sheet to assess the nonadiabatic effect. Exact quantum scattering calculations are performed by a chebyshev polynomial propagator and employing the double many body expansion potential energy surface of the electronic ground state of H<sub>3</sub>. Reaction probabilities are reported up to a total energy of ‚àº 3.0 eV, slightly above the energetic minimum of the seam of conical intersections at ‚àº 2.74 eV. Reaction probabilities are calculated up to the total angular momentum, $J = 20$ and for each value of ùêΩ, the projection quantum number ùêæ is varied from 0 to min ($J, K_{\text{max}}$), with $K_{\text{max}} = 4$. Probability results are compared and discussed with those obtained without the coriolis coupling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum mechanical study of vibrational state-resolved differential cross sections and transition probabilities for both the elastic/inelastic and the charge transfer processes have been carried out in the H<sup>+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> collisions at the experimental collision energy of 23 eV. The quantum dynamics has been performed within the vibrational close-coupling rotational infinite-order sudden approximation framework employing our newly obtained quasi-diabatic potential energy surfaces corresponding to the ground and the first excited electronic states which have been computed using <i>ab initio</i> procedures and Dunning‚Äôs correlation consistent-polarized valence triple zeta basis set at the multireference configuration interaction level of accuracy. The present theoretical results for elastic/inelastic processes provide an overall agreement with the available state-selected experimental data, whereas the results for the charge transfer channel show some variance in comparison with those of experiments and are similar to the earlier theoretical results obtained using model effective potential based on projected valence bond method and using semi-empirical <i>diatomics-in-molecules</i> potential. The possible reason for discrepancies and the likely ways to improve the results are discussed in terms of the inclusion of higher excited electronic states into the dynamics calculation.</p>

					<p>The validity of an effective harmonic oscillator approximation for anharmonic molecular vibrations is tested and compared with vibrational self consistent field and vibrational configurational interaction results. The effective harmonic oscillator is constructed variationally, by taking the trial wave function as a harmonic oscillator eigenfunction with the centroid and width parameter as variational paraeters. It is found that the effective harmonic oscillator approximation provides a description of the anharmonic eigenstates very similar to the vibrational self consistent field results.

				<title>Signatures of molecular recognition from the topography of electrostatic potential</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0815-0821</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recognition of interaction between two molecules is analysed via the topography of their molecular electrostatic potentials (MESP). The point of recognition between two species is proposed to be the geometry at which there is a change in the nature of the set of MESP critical points of one of the molecules <i>vis-a-vis</i> with its MESP topography at infinite separation. These results are presented for certain model systems such as pyridine and benzene dimers, cytosine-guanine and adenine-thymine base pairs in various orientations of approach of the two species.</p>

				<title>Computing magnetic anisotropy constants of single molecule magnets</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0823-0837</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here a theoretical approach to compute the molecular magnetic anisotropy parameters, $D_M$ and $E_M$ for single molecule magnets in any given spin eigenstate of exchange spin Hamiltonian. We first describe a hybrid constant $M_S$-valence bond (VB) technique of solving spin Hamiltonians employing full spatial and spin symmetry adaptation and we illustrate this technique by solving the exchange Hamiltonian of the Cu<sub>6</sub>Fe<sub>8</sub> system. Treating the anisotropy Hamiltonian as perturbation, we compute the D$_M$ and E$_M$ values for various eigenstates of the exchange Hamiltonian. Since, the dipolar contribution to the magnetic anisotropy is negligibly small, we calculate the molecular anisotropy from the single-ion anisotropies of the metal centers. We have studied the variation of D$_M$ and E$_M$ by rotating the single-ion anisotropies in the case of Mn<sub>12</sub>Ac and Fe<sub>8</sub> SMMs in ground and few low-lying excited states of the exchange Hamiltonian. In both the systems, we find that the molecular anisotropy changes drastically when the single-ion anisotropies are rotated. While in Mn<sub>12</sub>Ac SMM $D_M$ values depend strongly on the spin of the eigenstate, it is almost independent of the spin of the eigenstate in Fe<sub>8</sub> SMM. We also find that the $D_M$ value is almost insensitive to the orientation of the anisotropy of the core Mn(IV) ions. The dependence of $D_M$ on the energy gap between the ground and the excited states in both the systems has also been studied by using different sets of exchange constants.</p>

					<p>The structure and stability of spiro-cyclic water clusters containing up to 32 water molecules have been investigated at different levels of theory. Although there exist minima lower in energy than these spiro-cyclic clusters, calculations at the Hartree-Fock level, density functional theory using B3LYP parametrization and second order M√∏ller-Plesset perturbation theory using 6-31G<sup>&#8727;</sup> and 6-311++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> basis sets show that they are stable in their own right.

				<abstract>
					<p>Electrocyclic ring opening (ERO) reactions of 2-pyrone, 2-pyranol and pyran and their fluoro compounds (1-6) have been studied at MP2/6-31G(ùëë) level with special emphasis on the influence of fluorine on these pericyclic/pseudopericyclic processes. Calculations clearly predict that substitution of fluorine at C6 favour the reaction both kinetically and thermodynamically. Magnetic susceptibility anisotropy ($\Delta_{\chi\text{aniso}}$), NICS(0), NBO and bond critical property (BCP) analyses clearly illustrate the following; 2-pyrone (1) and 6-fluoro-2-pyrone (2) reactions are pseudopericyclic; 6-fluoro-2-pyranol (reaction 4) corresponds to a borderline case; 2-pyranol (3) and pyran (5) and 6-fluoro pyran (6) reactions are clearly pericyclic in character. Correspondingly pseudeopericyclic reactions show up orbital disconnections and fluorine delays the occurrence of orbital disconnections on the reaction trajectory.</p>

We find that, although the single carbon dioxide molecule prefers to be in a linear geometry, the puckering of angles occur in oligomers because of the intermolecular interactions. The resulting dipole moments reflect in the electronic excitation spectra of the molecular assemblies. The observation of significant nonlinear optical properties suggests the potential application of the dense carbon dioxide phases in opto-electronic devices.</p>

				<title>Comparison between implicit and hybrid solvation methods for the determination of $pK_a$ of mono-protonated form of $13^2$-(demethoxycarbonyl) pheophytin ùëé in methanol</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0881-0886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both implicit solvation method (dielectric polarizable continuum model, DPCM) and hybrid solvation method (cluster-continuum model) were adopted to calculate the $pK_a$ of mono-protonated form of $13^2$-(demethoxycarbonyl) pheophytin ùëé (Pheo) in methanol. In the cluster-continuum model calculations, we considered only 1 solvent molecule attached explicitly and others treated implicitly whereas in the DPCM calculations all the solvent molecules were treated implicitly. DPCM calculations were carried out on Pheo, PheoH+, Pheo-CH<sub>3</sub>OH and PheoH<sup>+</sup>-CH<sub>3</sub>OH in methanol solution. The aim of these calculations was to determine the free energy changes involved in the deprotonation of PheoH<sup>+</sup> ($\Delta G_{\text{sol}}$) and finally to obtain the corresponding $pK_a$ value. DPCM calculations were carried out employing the restricted open-shell density functional treatment (ROB3LYP) using the 6-31G(ùëë) basis set to determine the free energy of solvation of bare Pheo and PheoH+ and of the clusters, Pheo-CH<sub>3</sub>OH and PheoH<sup>+</sup>-CH<sub>3</sub>OH in methanol. <i>In-vacuo</i> geometries of all the species were obtained by performing optimizations at ROB3LYP level using the 6-31G(ùëë) basis. Electronic energies of all the species were then obtained by carrying out single point DFT calculations using 6-311+G(2ùëë, 2ùëù) basis set on the respective optimized geometries. Differences in thermal energy and molecular entropy were calculated by carrying out frequency calculations at ROB3LYP/STO-3G level on the optimized geometries of the truncated models. The optimized geometries of the clusters display intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. The $pK_a$ values of PheoH<sup>+</sup> calculated by DFT-DPCM and cluster-continuum methods are 6.12 and 4.70 respectively while the observed value is 4.14. The hydrogen bonding interaction between the solute and the solvent can be attributed for the good performance of the cluster-continuum model over pure continuum model.</p>

				<title>Statistical theory of neutral protein evolution by random site mutations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0887-0896</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding the features of the protein conformational space represents a key component to characterize protein structural evolution at the molecular level. This problem is approached in a twofold manner; simple lattice models are used to represent protein structures with the ability of a protein sequence to fold into the lowest energy native conformation, quantified as the foldability, which measures the fitness of the sequence. Alternatively, a self-consistent mean-field based theory is developed to evaluate the protein neutrality through random single-point and multiple-point mutations by calculating the pair-wise probability profile of the amino acid residues in a library of sequences, consistent with a particular foldability criterion. The theory predicts the change in sequence plasticity with the foldability criterion and also correlates the effect of hydrophobic residues on the variation of the free energy surface of the protein as a function of the number of cumulative mutations. The results obtained from the theory are compared with the exact enumeration results of $3 \times 3 \times 3$ lattice protein and also with some small real proteins chosen from the protein databank. An excellent match of the results obtained from theory and exact enumeration with those of real proteins validates the range of applicability of the theory. The theory may provide a new perspective in <i>de novo</i> protein design, <i>in-vivo/in-vitro</i> protein evolution and site-directed mutagenesis experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations of beryllium fluoride (BeF<sub>2</sub>) have been carried out in the canonical (NVT) ensemble using a rigid-ion potential model. The Green-Kubo formalism has been applied to compute viscosities and ionic conductivities of BeF<sub>2</sub> melt. The computational parameters critical for reliably estimating these collective transport properties are shown to differ significantly for viscosity and ionic conductivity. In addition to the equilibrium values of these transport properties, structural relaxation times as well as high-frequency IR-active modes are computed from the pressure and charge-flux auto correlation functions (ACFs) respectively. It is shown that a network-forming ionic melt, such as BeF<sub>2</sub>, will display persistent oscillatory behaviour of the integral of the charge-flux ACF. By suitable Fourier transformation, one can show that these persistent oscillations correspond to highfrequency, infra-red active vibrations associated with local modes of the network.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations are reported on the structure and dynamics of ùëõ-decane and 3-methylpentane in zeolite NaY. We have calculated several properties such as the center of mass-center of mass rdf, the end-end distance distribution, bond angle distribution and dihedral angle distribution. We have also analysed trajectory to obtain diffusivity and velocity autocorrelation function (VACF). Surprisingly, the diffusivity of 3-methylpentane which is having larger cross-section perpendicular to the long molecular axis is higher than ùëõ-decane at 300 K. Activation energies have been obtained from simulations performed at 200 K, 300 K, 350 K, 400 K and 450 K in the NVE ensemble. These results can be understood in terms of the previously known levitation effect. Arrhenious plot has higher value of slope for ùëõ-decane (5.9 kJ/mol) than 3-methylpentane (3.7 kJ/mol) in agreement with the prediction of levitation effect.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>For obtaining microscopic structural information in binary mixtures, often partial pair correlation functions are used. In the present study, a general approach is presented for obtaining the neighbourhood structural information for binary mixtures in terms of nth nearest neighbour distribution (NND) functions (for $n = 1, 2, 3,\ldots$). These functions are derived from the partial pair correlation functions in a hierarchical manner, based on the approach adopted earlier by us for single component fluids. Comparison of the results with MD simulation for Lennard-Jones binary mixtures is also presented. NND functions show reasonable matching for smaller n values particularly at higher density. The average ùëõth nearest neighbour distance shows interesting feature.</p>

					<p>The traditional numerical computation of the first derivative $f'(x)$ of a given function $f(x)$ of a single argument ùë• by central differencing is known to involve aspects of both accuracy and precision. By analysing both we arrive at an algorithm that closely approximates the most accurate answer obtainable by this method, typically with at least 9 accurate decimals, while preserving a minimal footprint. The results apply to software based on the IEEE-754 specification, and are illustrated with Excel.</p>

				<title>Generation of serine/threonine check points in HN(C)N spectra</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0955-0964</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We describe here a simple modification of the HN(C)N experiment for the generation of serine/threonine check points in the three-dimensional experiment. The various `triplet of residue‚Äô specific peak patterns in the spectra are documented for ease of analysis and sequential backbone resonance assignment. The performance of this experiment, referred to as HN(C)N-ST, is demonstrated using two proteins, one properly folded and the other completely denatured. It is noteworthy that, even in the denatured protein, where spectral dispersions are rather poor, about 90&#37; of the sequential connectivities through the chain could be established from this single experiment. This would have great implications for structural genomics efforts.</p>

				<title>Coulomb explosion of methyl iodide clusters using giga watt laser pulses in the visible region: Effect of wavelength, polarisation and doping</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0965-0972</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanosecond laser-induced Coulomb explosion studies have been carried out for methyl iodide clusters at 532 and 563 nm under similar laser intensity ($\sim 5  \times 10^9$ W/cm<sup>2</sup>) conditions. Multiply charged atomic ions of carbon and iodine having large kinetic energy (&#8764; 100 s of eV) were observed in both the cases. Observation of higher charged states at 563 nm for Coulomb exploded atomic ions supports the preposition of enhanced inverse bremsstrahlung heating of the ionized cluster system at this wavelength. The angular distribution of the multiply charged atomic ions is found to be isotropic with respect to laser polarization direction at 532 nm. When water doped methyl iodide clusters were irradiated at 563 nm, highly charged atomic ions of oxygen along with carbon and iodine were also observed. This result suggests that the mechanism leading to Coulomb explosion is a collective property of the cluster as a whole and individual molecular properties do not play significant role.</p>

					<p>Salicyclaldimines (<b>5-9</b>) and naphthaldimines (<b>10-13</b>) derived from condensation reactions of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> donor type bifunctional aminopodands (<b>1-4</b>), [(H<sub>2</sub>NPhO)<sub>2</sub>R, where R = CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>PhCH<sub>2</sub>], and hydrazine monohydrate with salicylaldehyde and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, respectively, have been prepared (scheme 1) and characterized by elemental analyses, UV-vis, FTIR, NMR and MS. NMR assignments were made using <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, DEPT and aided by 2D HETCOR and HMBC heteronuclear correlation techniques. The UV-vis spectra of the Schiff bases have been systematically studied in organic solvents of different polarity, acidic and basic media and found useful in understanding of tautomeric equilibria (phenol-imine, O-H‚Ä¶N and keto-amine, O‚Ä¶H-N forms) in this series. The molecular structure of <b>8</b>  has been determined crystallographically, and observed that the compound is in the form of phenol-imine, defined by the strong intramolecular [O-H‚Ä¶N = $1 \cdots 72$(3), $1 \cdots 81$(2) &#197;] hydrogen bonds. Compound <b>8</b>  crystallizes in the monoclinic space group $P2_1/a$ with $a = 8 \cdots 4675$(7), $b = 38 \cdots 448$(3), $c = 9 \cdots 3875$(7) &#197;, $\beta = 103 \cdots 0780$(10)&#176;, $V = 2976 \cdots 9$(4) &#197;<sup>3</sup>, $Z = 4$ and $D_x = 1 \cdots 271$ Mg m<sup>-3</sup>, and contains acetonitrile molecule in the crystal lattice.</p>

				<page>1011-1015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>ùõº-Chloroketones find numerous synthetic uses. We have developed a simple method of preparation of these compounds starting from alkenes adopting the <i>Green Chemistry</i> principle of solventfree reaction. The procedure involves addition of NOCl generated <i>in situ</i> by the reaction of AcOH-HCl (3 : 1) with amyl nitrite to alkenes and treating the ùõº-chloronitroso compounds obtained as dimers with levulinic acid in presence of a few drops of 6N HCl, the latter being a three-step domino reaction, in which the first is dissociation of dimer to monomer, the second is tautomerisation of the nitroso function to oxime followed by deoximation in the third step. The yields are excellent. Since the starting compounds are readily available alkenes and the reaction is carried out under mild conditions leading to excellent yields of highly useful ùõº-chloroketones, the procedure has the potential of wide application.</p>

The thiacalix[4]arene framework in both <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> adopts the 1,3-alternate conformation. Compound <b>1</b> forms a 1-D chain by weak hydrogen bonding (C-H$\cdots$N) interactions between two thiadiazole groups in two different molecules. The chains are further connected to form a 2-D network through sulfur-sulfur (S$\cdots$S) interactions. The lattice water molecules which exist as dimers by forming hydrogen bonds (O-H$\cdots$O) promote a 3-D supramolecular structure through weak hydrogen bonding (O-H$\cdots$S) interactions between the lattice water dimers and the 2-D networks. On the other hand, compound <b>2</b>, based on dimer which is formed by weak hydrogen bonding (C-H$\cdots$S) interactions, is extended to a 1-D chain through sulfur-sulfur (S$\cdots$S) interactions. The dimers of lattice methanol molecules linked by hydrogen bonds (O-H$\cdots$O) act as bridges to link the 1-D chains into a 2-D network through weak hydrogen bonding (C-H$\cdots$N) interactions.</p>

				<title>Kinetics and equilibria for the axial ligation of bromomethyl (aqua)cobaloxime with pyridines - Isolation characterization and DNA binding</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1053-1060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics and equilibria for the axial ligation of pyridine and substituted pyridines to bromomethyl(aqua)cobaloxime have been measured spectrophotometrically in aqueous solutions of ionic strength 1.0 M (KC1) at 25&#176;C as a function of ùëùH. The binding constants and rate of formation increase in the order 4-NH<sub>2</sub>Py 4-EtPy &#62; 4-MePy &#62; Py &#62; 2-NH<sub>2</sub>Py &#62; 2-EtPy. The data have been interpreted based on the basicity of the ligand, ùúã-back bonding from Co(III) ‚Üí L and hard and soft interactions. The rate of substitution of H<sub>2</sub>O varies with the pKa of the incoming ligand, thus establishing the existence of nucleophilic participation of the ligand in the transition state. We have investigated the DNA binding of bromomethyl(aqua)cobaloxime with DNA. Bromomethyl(ligand)cobaloximes were isolated and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and NMR (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C) spectra.</p>

				<title>Preparation and adsorption property of aminated cross linking microbeads of GMA/EGDMA for bilirubin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1061-1068</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cross linking microbeads with a controllable diameter were synthesized by suspension copolymerization of the monomer glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and the cross linking agent ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EGDMA). By the ring-opening reaction of the epoxy groups, the microbeads GMA/EGDMA were modified with different aminating agents and resulting in the aminated microbeads. The morphology of the microbeads was characterized by SEM. The adsorption property of aminated microbeads for bilirubin was investigated, and the effects of various factors, such as the chemical structures of the aminating agents, pH values of the medium and the presence of bovine serum albumin in the adsorption medium, on the adsorption property were examined. The experimental results show that the aminated microbeads have strong adsorption ability for bilirubin, and the isotherm adsorption behaviour is fitted to Freundlich equation satisfactorily. The adsorption ability of the aminated microbeads modified with hexanediamine is stronger than that of others, and the longer the molecule of multi-ethylene multiamine, the weaker the adsorption ability for bilirubin. The pH value of the medium affects the adsorption ability greatly, as pH = 6, the adsorption ability is strongest. In the presence of BSA, the microbeads still have a higher adsorption capacity towards bilirubin.</p>

				<title>Disposable amperometric immunosensor based on layer-by-layer electro-depositing of the nanogold particles, prussian blue-modified indium tin oxide for determination of ùõº-fetoprotein</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1069-1076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a novel disposable immunosensor for the detection of ùõº-fetoprotein (AFP) based on the Indium tin oxide (ITO) modified by the sequential electro-deposition of the nanogold particles (nano-Au) and prussian blue (PB) is described. The ITO is employed to reduce the cost, instead of expensive gold electrode, glassy carbon electrode or platinum electrode. The layer-by-layer (LBL) electro-deposition of the nano-Au, PB is used for blocking the possible leakage from the substrate electrode surface and to prevent shedding of composite membrane. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor displays a broad linear response to AFP, the working range being 0.25 to 300.0 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> with a detection limit of 0.04 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. The studied immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity, fast analytical time and good stability. The proposed methodology is potentially attractive for clinical immunoassays.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chrysalis-like morphologies of CuO have been synthesized in large-quantity via a simple chemical deposition method without the use of any complex instruments and reagents. CuO nanocrystals showed a different morphology at three different temperatures, 25, 60 and 100&#176;C. The particle size, morphology and crystal structure of the samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra. The catalytic effect of CuO nanoparticles on the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) was investigated by STA 409 PC thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10&#176;C min<sup>-1</sup> from 35 to 500&#176;C. Compared with the thermal decomposition of pure AP, the addition of CuO nanoparticles decreased the decomposition temperature of AP by about 85&#176;C.</p>

				<title>Voltammetric sensor for D-penicillamine determination based on its electrocatalytic oxidation at the surface of ferrocenes modified carbon paste electrodes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1083-1091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrocatalytic oxidation of D-penicillamine (D-PA) at the surface of ferrocene modified carbon paste electrode (FCCPE) was thoroughly investigated in aqueous solution with various pH. The performance of this modified electrode was compared with those of 2,7-<i>bis</i>(ferrocenyl ethyl) fluoren-9-one modified carbon paste electrode (2,7-BFEFMCPE). In the optimum condition, the oxidation of D-PA at the surface of FCCPE and 2,7-BFEFMCPE is occurred about 480 and 320 mV less positive than that unmodified carbon paste electrode, respectively. The linear dynamic ranges $6  \times  10^{-5}$ M$^{-2}  \times 10^{-3}$ M, $6.5  \times  10^{-5}$ M-$1.1 \times  10^{-3}$ M and $7\times 10^{-6}$ M-$1.6 \times 10^{-4}$M, $7 \times  10^{-6}$ M-$2 \times  10^{-4}$ M of D-PA are obtained from CV and DPV methods for FCCPE and 2,7-BFEFMCPE, respectively. The detection limits (3ùúé) were determined as $5.4 \times  10^{-5}$ M and $6.3 \times  10^{-5}$ M in CV and $6.2 \times 10^{-6}$ M and $6.8 \times 10^{-6}$ M in DPV determinations for FCCPE and 2,7-BFEFMCPE, respectively. The proposed method was applied in a highly sensitive determination of D-PA in drug and human synthetic serum samples by standard addition and recovery methods, respectively.</p>

				<title>Multidimensional potential of boron-containing molecules in functional materials</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0007-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Boron-containing molecular systems have received much attention under theoretical aspects and from the side of synthetic organic chemistry. However, their potential for further applications such as optically interesting effects such as Non-Linear Optics (NLO), medical uses for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), or magnetism has been recognised only fairly recently. Molecular systems containing boron offer particular mechanisms to accommodate unpaired electrons which may result in stable radicals as spin-bearing materials. Among such materials are organoboron compounds in which the prototypical electron deficient (<sup>10</sup>B, <sup>11</sup>B) boron vs. carbon centers can accept and help to delocalise added electrons in a 2-dimensionally conjugated ùúã system. Alternatively, oligoboron clusters B$_n$X$_n^k$ and the related carboranes or metallacarboranes are capable of adding or losing single electrons to form paramagnetic clusters with 3-dimensionally delocalised spin, according to combined experimental studies and quantum chemical calculations. The unique nuclear properties of <sup>10</sup>B are of therapeutic value if their selective transport via appended carbon nanotubes, boron nanotubes, or magnetic nanoparticles can be effected.</p>

				<title>Magnetic behaviour in metal-organic frameworks ‚Äî Some recent examples</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0019-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The article describes the synthesis, structure and magnetic investigations of a series of metal-organic framework compounds formed with Mn<sup>+2</sup> and Ni<sup>+2</sup> ions. The structures, determined using the single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicated that the structures possess two- and three-dimensional structures with magnetically active dimers, tetramers, chains, two-dimensional layers connected by polycarboxylic acids. These compounds provide good examples for the investigations of magnetic behaviour. Magnetic studies have been carried out using SQUID magnetometer in the range of 2-300 K and the behaviour indicates a predominant anti-ferromagnetic interactions, which appears to differ based on the M-O-C-O-M and/or the M-O-M (M = metal ions) linkages. Thus, compounds with carboxylate (Mn- O-C-O-Mn) connected ones, [C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>][Mn(H<sub>2</sub>O){C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(COO)<sub>3</sub>\}], <b>I</b>, [{Mn(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>}{C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O(COO)<sub>2</sub>}]$\cdots$H<sub>2</sub>O, <b>II</b>, [{Mn(H<sub>2</sub>O)}{C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O(COO)<sub>2</sub>}], <b>III</b>, show simple anti-ferromagnetic behaviour. The compounds with Mn-O/OH-Mn connected dimer and tetramer units in [NaMn{C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(COO)<sub>3</sub>}], <b>IV</b>, [Mn<sub>2</sub>($\mu_3$-OH) (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>{C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(COO)<sub>3</sub>}]$\cdot$2H<sub>2</sub>O, <b>V</b>, show canted-antiferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic behaviour, respectively. The presence of infinite one-dimensional -Ni-OH-Ni- chains in the compound, [NiR_2R(HR_2RO)($\mu_3$-OH)<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>], <b>VI</b>, gives rise to ferromagnet-like behaviour at low temperatures. The compounds, [Mn<sub>3</sub>{C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(COO)<sub>3</sub>}$<sub>2</sub>], <b>VII</b> and [{Mn(OH)}<sub>2</sub>{C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O(COO)<sub>2</sub>}], <b>VIII</b>, have two-dimensional infinite -Mn-O/OH-Mn- layers with triangular magnetic lattices, which resemble the Kagome and brucite-like layer. The magnetic studies indicated canted-antiferromagnetic behaviour in both the cases. Variable temperature EPR and theoretical magnetic modelling studies have been carried out on selected compounds to probe the nature of the magnetic species and their interactions with them.</p>

The superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of 31.3 ($\pm \, 0.05$) K has been observed in $x = 0.1$ composition which is the maximum $T_c$ so far in the La(O/F)FeAs superconductor family at ambient pressure. Further increase in ùë• leads to suppression and broadening of superconducting transition. The resistive transition curves under different magnetic fields were investigated, leading to determination of upper critical field $H_{c2}$ (ùëá) of this new superconductor. The value of $H_{c2}$ at zero temperature is estimated to be about 46 T corresponding to coherence length &#8764; 27 &#197;.</p>

				<page>0047-0056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular Tailoring Approach (MTA) is a method developed for enabling <i>ab initio</i> calculations on prohibitively large molecules or atomic/molecular clusters. A brief review of MTA, a linear scaling technique based on set inclusion and exclusion principle, is provided. The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MESP) of smaller clusters is exploited for building initial geometries for the larger ones, followed by MTA geometry optimization. The applications of MTA are illustrated with a few test cases such as (CO<sub>2</sub>)$_n$ and Li$_n$ clusters employing Density Functional theory (DFT) and a nanocluster of orthoboric acid at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level. Further, a discussion on the geometries and energetics of benzene tetramers and pentamers, treated at the M√∏ller-Plesset second order (MP2) perturbation theory, is given. MTA model is employed for evaluating some cluster properties viz. adiabatic ionization potential, MESP, polarizability, Hessian matrix and infrared frequencies. These property evaluations are carried out on a series of test cases and are seen to offer quite good agreement with those computed by an actual calculation. These case studies highlight the advantages of MTA model calculations vis-√†-vis the actual ones with reference to the CPU-time, memory requirements and accuracy.</p>

				<title>Development of gas sensors using ZnO nanostructures</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0057-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Different ZnO nanostructures such as nanowires, nanobelts and tetrapods have been grown and used for preparation of thick film (with random grain boundaries) as well as isolated nanowire/nanobelt gas sensors. Sensitivity of different type of sensors has been studied to H<sub>2</sub>S and NO gases. The results show that the response of ZnO sensors to H<sub>2</sub>S arises from grain boundary only whereas both grain boundaries and intragrain resistances contribute towards response to NO. In addition, oxygen vacancies in the lattice were also seen to help in improvement of sensor response. Room temperature operating H<sub>2</sub>S and NO sensors based on ZnO nanowires have been demonstrated. Further, sensors based on isolated nanobelts were found to be highly selective in their response to NO.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0071-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microwave-assisted procedure for low temperature solid state synthesis of sodium zirconium phosphate (NZP), a material with the potential for immobilization and disposal of high level nuclear waste, was developed. Three selected fission products, namely, Cesium, Strontium and Tellurium were introduced (substituted) in the NZP matrix during its synthesis at 450&#176;C. Leaching studies were carried out on the fission product substituted NZP sintered at 1000&#176;C, in pure de-ionized water and 80&#37; saturated brine solution at the ambient temperatures of 30&#176;C and 90&#176;C for four weeks. The major part of leaching in all the cases was observed in the first week. The extent of leaching after four weeks was found not exceeded from 12 to 15&#37; of the elements substituted in NZP, which later became negligibly small. The effect of temperature and the nature of leachant on the leaching rate did not indicate any systematic trend. The EDX analysis of the surfaces of the leached NZP pellets showed that the leaching of the dopants is limited mainly to the surface region of the sintered pellets.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A brief review of the issues involved in modelling of the solid state transformation kinetics is presented. The fact that apart from the standard thermodynamic parameters, certain path variables like heating or cooling rate can also exert a crucial influence on the kinetic outcome is stressed. The kinetic specialties that are intrinsic to phase changes proceeding under varying thermal history are enumerated. A simple and general modelling methodology for understanding the kinetics of non-isothermal transformations is outlined.</p>

				<page>0109-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The self-aggregation behaviour of ternary mixtures of alkyl (C$_{12}^-$, C$_{14}^-$ and C$_{16}^-$) triphenylphosphonium bromides was studied by conductometry and tensiometry. The pure surfactants showed two Critical Micellar Concentrations (CMCs) by conductometry, but their ternary mixtures produce single CMC both by conductometry and tensiometry. The CMC values determined were found to be lower than that obtained from Clint equation suggesting synergistic interaction among the monomers within the micelles. Their bulk properties, like fraction of counterions bound to the micelles and free energy of micellization were evaluated. Interfacial parameters, like surface excess, minimum head group area of monomer and free energy of adsorption were also assessed. Interfacial adsorption was found to be more spontaneous than micellization. The head group area per monomer in ternary systems was larger than pure systems due to stronger electrostatic repulsion among the charged head groups. The values of the packing parameters supported the pure as well as ternary micelles to be spherical. The TPB surfactants efficiently quenched pyrene fluorescence; the performances of the homologues in this respect were assessed.</p>

					<p>A series of 2,8-ùëù-diaryldibenzothiophene derivatives were synthesized and characterized. These molecules have electron withdrawing or electron donating groups at the <i>para</i> phenyl position, which alters the electronic properties of these derivatives. The quantum yield, fluorescence lifetime, singlet, triplet and E<sub>HOMO</sub> energy levels of these compounds were determined by fluorescence, phosphorescence and cyclic voltammetry. A plot of Hammett constants of the <i>para</i> substituents vs E<sub>HOMO</sub> revealed a linear relationship. The usefulness of these molecules in organic light emitting diodes, OLEDs is discussed vis-√†-vis the energy levels and properties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A novel series of fifteen 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2($1H$)-yl)-ùëÅ-(substituted phenyl) propanamides <b>3(a-o)</b> were synthesized by reacting the corresponding 3-chloro-ùëÅ-(aryl) propanamides <b>2(a-o)</b> with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline <b>1</b> in acetonitrile. The compounds have been characterized on the basis of elemental analysis and spectral data. All the compounds were evaluated for their HIV-1 RT inhibitory activity. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2($1H$)-yl)-ùëÅ-ùëú-tolyl propanamide <b>3d</b> and 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)-ùëÅ-(2,4,6-tribromophenyl)propanamide <b>3f</b> were identified as significant inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with 56&#37; and 43&#37; residual RT activity respectively at the final concentration of 40 ùúáM when compared with the standard drug Efavirenz. Docking studies with HIV-1 RT (PDB ID 1rt2) were also performed in order to investigate the binding pattern of these compounds.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The transesterification of methyl salicylate with phenol has been studied in vapour phase over solid acid catalysts such as ZrO<sub>2</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub> and SO$^{2-}_4$ or Mo(VI) ions modified zirconia. The catalytic materials were prepared and characterized for their total surface acidity, BET surface area and powder XRD patterns. The effect of mole-ratio of the reactants, catalyst bed temperature, catalyst weight, flowrate of reactants, WHSV and time-on-stream on the conversion (&#37;) of phenol and selectivity (&#37;) of salol has been investigated. A good yield (up to 70&#37;) of salol with 90&#37; selectivity was observed when the reactions were carried out at a catalyst bed temperature of 200&#176;C and flow-rate of 10 mL/h in presence of Mo(VI)/ZrO<sub>2</sub> as catalyst. The results have been interpreted based on the variation of acidic properties and powder XRD phases of zirconia on incorporation of SO$^{2-}_4$ or Mo(VI) ions. The effect of poisoning of acid sites of SO$^{2-}_4$ or Mo(VI) ions modified zirconia on total surface acidity, powder XRD phases and catalytic activity was also studied. Possible reaction mechanisms for the formation of salol and diphenyl ether over acid sites are proposed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>3-Methoxy-4-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (MBBA) resin was synthesized by a two-step sequence under microwave irradiation involving the reaction of commercially available Merrifield resin with vanillin, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride. MBBA resin was treated with bromides in the presence of sodium hydride to afford the corresponding resin-bound benzyl ethers. Cleavage of the resin-bound benzyl ethers from the MBBA resin was carried out using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoqunone (DDQ) to give the corresponding alcohols in good yields. Moreover, the recovery, regeneration, and reuse of this polymer support could be achieved easily. MBBA resin can be developed as a kind of solid-phase synthesis bead of alcohols.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Novel biodegradable aliphatic poly(ether-urethane)s (PEUs) based on pluronic F-68 (PLF68) and castor oil were synthesized by the solution polymerization technique. These polymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>HNMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to confirm the PEU formation and the molecular weight. Moderate molecular weight PEUs were obtained and converted into microspheres by solvent evaporation method to study the controlled release (CR) characteristics for 5-flurouracil (5-FU). PLF-68 acts as amphiphilic filler, which enhances the release of a hydrophobic drug such as 5-FU. Sizes of the microspheres as measured by laser light scattering technique ranged between 15 and 42 ùúám. An increase in the size of particles was observed with increasing molar ratio of PLF-68 with respect to castor oil. The percentage encapsulation efficiency varied between 71 and 98. Surface morphology of the microspheres as studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the spherical nature of the particles with wrinkles on their surfaces. The release of 5-FU through the microspheres was investigated in pH 7.4-phosphate buffer. An increase in release rate was observed with increasing molar ratio of PLF68 with respect to castor oil.</p>

				<title>A new chromogenic agent for iron(III): Synthesis, structure and spectroscopic studies</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>A heterocyclic hydrazone ligand, diacetyl monoxime-2-pyridyl hydrazone, HL, <b>1</b>, was investigated as a new chromogenic agent for selective detection of Fe<sup>3+</sup>. The ligand <b>1</b>, undergoes 1 : 2 complexation with Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> to form complexes [Fe<sup>III</sup>(HL)<sub>2</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub>, <b>1a</b> and [Ni<sup>II</sup>(HL)<sub>2</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>, <b>1b</b> respectively. The iron(III) complex <b>1a</b> gives a characteristic absorption peak at 487 nm with distinct reddish-pink colouration. The change in colour can easily be distinguished from other metal complexes by the naked eye. No obvious interference was observed in presence of other metal ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>). The bands appearing in the UV region (200-340 nm) are characteristics of the ligand, HL, <b>1</b>. In the complexes [Fe<sup>III</sup>(HL)<sub>2</sub>]Cl<sub>3</sub>, <b>1a</b>, and [Ni<sup>II</sup>(HL)<sub>2</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>, <b>1b</b>, these ligand centered bands are accompanied by multiple bands extending into the visible region (350-500 nm). The association constants ($K_{\text{ass}}$, UV-Vis) were found to be $(6.4865 \pm 0.004)\times 10^5$ for the complex <b>1a</b> and $(1.1960 \pm 0.002)\times 10^5$ for the complex <b>1b</b> at 298 K determined by the UV-Vis spectroscopy. On excitation at 285 nm, the ligand HL, <b>1</b> strongly emits at 364 nm due to an intraligand<sup>1</sup>($\pi - \pi^\ast$) transition. The complexes are luminescent ($\lambda_{\text{ex}}$ 285 nm, $\lambda_{\text{em}}$ 365 nm) with $F/F_0$ 0.75 for <b>1a</b> and 0.81 for <b>1b</b>. In both the cases, the 1 : 2 binding is confirmed by Job‚Äôs method. Molecular structure of the complex <b>1b</b> has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Here, two crystallographically distinct but metrically very similar molecules making an enantiomeric pair constitute the asymmetric unit in which both metal atoms are tris chelated in meridional geometry.</p>

					<p>Reactions of four reducing radical species namely $e^-_{\text{aq}}$, H-atoms, (CH<sub>3</sub>)$_2^\bullet$COH and $^{\bullet}$CO$^-_2$ radicals with [Co(III)(phendione)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]Cl (complex) have been studied by electron pulse radiolysis. Time resolved transient absorption spectra for all the four species show two peaks which match with those of phendione anion radical produced by the reaction of e$^-_{\text{aq}}$ with phendione. However, there are some differences in the spectral and kinetic features in the reactions of H-atoms and $^{\bullet}CO^-_2$ radicals with the complex which are elaborated. Steady state absorption spectra on irradiation under reducing conditions indicate breakdown of the complex. The anion radical initially produced has fairly long lifetime of few 100 microseconds. Spectral studies show that initial site of attack for electron transfer is the phendione moiety. Subsequently the electron is transferred to other sites resulting in aquation/decomposition to metal ion. Conductometric studies show that conductance substantially increases on irradiation and could be attributed to aquation/de-ligation of the complex by intramolecular electron transfer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Crystal structure of 2,3,12,13-tetrabromo-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-butyloxy phenyl)porphinato copper(II) tetrahydrofuran solvate was examined and it features enhanced non-planar distortion of the porphyrin ring. The normal coordinate structural decomposition (NSD) analysis for the out-of-plane displacement of atoms of the macrocyclic ring in CuT(4-C$_n$P)PBr4 ($n = 4, 6$) indicates mainly saddled distortion combined with small contribution from wave conformation. The electrochemical studies on MT (4-C$_n$P)PBr<sub>4</sub> (M = 2H, Cu(II), Zn(II)) revealed cathodic shift in redox potentials in contrast to the corresponding brominated porphyrins, MTPPBr<sub>4</sub>. This is perhaps due to non-planarity of the porphyrin ring and the positive inductive effect of the alkyloxy groups.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ten new binuclear singly oxo-bridged molybdenum complexes (complexes <b>1-10</b>) were prepared using five pyrimidine derived Schiff base ligands and two Mo(V) precursors (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MoOCl<sub>5</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MoOBr<sub>5</sub>. The ligands are prepared by the condensation of 4,6-dimethyl 2-hydrazino pyrimidine with salicylaldehyde (for HL<sub>1</sub>), ùëú-hydroxy acetophenone (for HL<sub>2</sub>) and substituted salicylaldehydes (for HL<sub>3</sub>, HL<sub>4</sub> and HL<sub>5</sub>) respectively. These ligands are already reported as good donors for Mo(VI) state. The ùúá-oxo Mo(V) complexes reported here bears a distorted octahedral geometry around each Mo atom with either N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Cl or N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Br chromophores. Fine variations in the spectroscopic behaviour of the complexes are observed in accordance with the varying electron donating properties of the ligands. All the complexes are unstable in solution and X-ray quality crystal of complex <b>1</b> could be isolated. All the complexes are characterized by IR and UV-Vis spectra.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Eight indole derivatives were studied for their DNA binding ability using fluorescence quenching and molecular docking methods. These indole compounds have structural moieties similar as in few indole alkaloids. Experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that indole derivatives bind in the minor groove of DNA. Thermodynamic profiles of DNA complexes of indole derivatives were obtained from computational methods. The complexes were largely stabilized by H-bonding and van der Waal‚Äôs forces with positive entropy values. Indole derivatives were found to possess some Purine (Pu) - Pyrimidine (Py) specificity with DNA sequences. The results obtained from experimental and computational methods showed good agreement with each other, supported by their correlation constant values.</p>

				<title>A comparative study of the spectroscopic features of the low-lying electronic states of H<sub>2</sub>F<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> ions</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0259-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Configuration interaction studies of H<sub>2</sub>F<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup> ions, using 6-311G ($3d$, $3p$) basis sets, have revealed several interesting differences in their spectral behaviour. Both of them are having bent ground state (<sup>1</sup>A<sub>1</sub>) equilibrium geometries, but there is a huge difference (&#8764; 1.93 eV) between their energy barrier to linearity. Their first two excited states are found to be linear ${}^3\Pi_u$ and ${}^1\Pi_u$ states, correlating to <sup>3</sup>B<sub>1</sub>/<sup>3</sup>A<sub>1</sub> and <sup>1</sup>B<sub>1</sub>/<sup>1</sup>A<sub>1</sub> Renner-Teller pairs, respectively, in the C<sub>2v</sub> symmetry. Considering only the allowed singlet-singlet transitions at the ground state equilibrium geometry, the lowest energy transitions found to have transition moment values of 0.65 D and 0.48 D for H<sub>2</sub>F<sup>+</sup>and H<sub>2</sub>Cl<sup>+</sup>, respectively, appearing in the far UV region. Conical intersections take place during the symmetrical stretching of two H-Cl bonds in the chloronium ion for the first two pairs of excited states (1<sup>1</sup>A<sub>2</sub>/1<sup>1</sup>B<sub>1</sub> and $1^1$A<sub>2</sub>/$1^1$B<sub>1</sub>) in the C<sub>2v</sub> symmetry. This intersection may initiate pre-dissociation from the upper bound adiabatic 1A‚Ä≥ state to the lower repulsive <sup>1</sup>A" state in the C$_s$ symmetry. Fluoronium ion is expected to dissociate via a single electronic state due to the absence of such intersection.</p>

				<title>Direct electrochemistry of hemoglobin entrapped in dextran film on carbon ionic liquid electrode</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0271-0278</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Direct electrochemistry of hemoglobin (Hb) entrapped in the dextran (De) film on the surface of a room temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF<sub>6</sub>) modified carbon paste electrode (CILE) has been investigated. UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy showed that Hb retained its native structure in the De film. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated an uniform film was formed on the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetric experiments indicated that the electron transfer efficiency between Hb and the electrode was greatly improved due to the presence of the De film and ionic liquid, which provided a biocompatible and higher conductive interface. A pair of well-defined and quasi-reversible redox peak was obtained with the anodic and cathodic peaks located at -0.195 V and -0.355 V in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution, respectively. The electrochemical parameters were calculated by investigating the relationship of the peak potential with the scan rate. The fabricated De/Hb/CILE showed good electrocatalytic ability to the reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with the linear concentration range from $4.0 \times 10^{-6}$ to $1.5  \times  10^{-5}$ mol/L and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant ($K_M^{\text{app}}$) for the electrocatalytic reaction was calculated as 0.17 ùúáM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrodeposition of Ni-Co alloy from a nickel Watt‚Äôs solution in the absence and presence of a permanent parallel magnetic field (PPMF) to the plane of deposition (perpendicular to direction of current) produced a deposited layer with mostly fine grain structure. The deposited layers  have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). It was found that the mass deposition rate with PPMF was greater than the deposition in the absence of PPMF, where the rate of difference electrodeposited mass ($\Delta m$) was calculated ($\Delta m = 0.07$ to 0.12 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>min<sup>-1</sup>). In the presence of PPMF, the electrodeposition of cobalt was high (0 to 5%) compare to the absence of PPMF. The corrosion resistance of Ni-Co alloy layers fabricated by PPMF proved higher than without PPMF.</p>

				<feature>Perspective Articles</feature>
				<page>0295-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Advances in supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering reported from India within the last decade are highlighted in the categories of new intermolecular interactions, designed supramolecular architectures, network structures, multi-component host-guest systems, cocrystals, and polymorphs. Understanding self-assembly and crystallization through X-ray crystal structures is illustrated by two important prototypes - the large unit cell of elusive saccharin hydrate, Na<sub>16</sub>(sac)$_{16} . 30$H<sub>2</sub>O, which contains regular and irregular domains in the same structure, and by the Aufbau build up of zinc phosphate framework structures, e.g. ladder motif in [C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>12</sub>][Zn(HPO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] to layer structure in [C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>12</sub>][Zn<sub>2</sub>(HPO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] upon prolonged hydrothermal conditions. The pivotal role of accurate X-ray diffraction in supramolecular and structural studies is evident in many examples. Application of the bottomup approach to make powerful NLO and magnetic materials, design of efficient organogelators, and crystallization of novel pharmaceutical polymorphs and cocrystals show possible future directions for interdisciplinary research in chemistry with materials and pharmaceutical scientists. This article traces the evolution of supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering starting from the early nineties and projects a center stage for chemistry in the natural sciences.</p>

					<p>Binuclear complexes [Cu(ùúá-RSSR)]<sub>2</sub> (<b>1</b>) and [M<sub>2</sub>(ùúá-PDS)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sub>2</sub> (M = Cu(II), <b>2</b>; Fe(II), <b>3</b>), where H<sub>2</sub>RSSR is a reduced Schiff base derived from 2-(thioethyl)salicylaldimine having a disulphide moiety and H<sub>2</sub>PDS is derived from dimerization of D-penicillamine, have been prepared, structurally characterized, and their photo-induced DNA cleavage activity studied. The crystal structure of <b>1</b> shows the complex as a discrete binuclear species with each metal in a CuN2O2 square-planar geometry (Cu‚Ä¶Cu, 6.420 &#197;). The tetradentate RSSR<sup>2-</sup> acts as a bridging ligand. The sulphur atoms in the disulphide unit do not interact with the metal ions. Complexes <b>1-3</b> do not show any DNA cleavage activity in darkness. The copper(II) complexes exhibit chemical nuclease activity in the presence of 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Cleavage of supercoiled DNA has been observed in UV-A light of 365 nm for <b>1</b> and red light of 647.1 nm for both <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in air. Mechanistic data reveal the involvement of the disulphide unit as photosensitizer generating hydroxyl radicals ($^{\bullet}$OH) as the reactive species. Photo-induced DNA cleavage in red light seems to involve sulphide radicals in a type-I process and hydroxyl radicals. The dicopper(II) complexes show significant anaerobic photo-induced DNA cleavage activity in red light under argon following type-I pathway without involving any reactive oxygen species.</p>

					<p>Rates of electron transfer reaction of thioglycolic acid with vanadium(V) substituted Keggintype heteropolyanion, [PV<sup>V</sup>V<sup>V</sup>W<sub>10</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>5-</sup>, in acetate-acetic acid buffers have been measured spectrophotometrically at 25&#176;C.

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0341-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The adsorption of lipid Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) vesicles on a hydrophobic substrate has been investigated in aqueous buffer solution by means of the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and reflectometry. DOPC vesicles were prepared by the injection method on a hydrophobic substrate using 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) self-assembled on a gold-coated AT-cut quartz. The reflection spectrometry measurements of the adsorbed vesicles showed nearly monolayer formation in few cases, while in most other experiments, the frequency changes measured suggested multilayer formation assuming the usual Sauerbrey equation to hold in the present system as well. Presence of NaCl, KCl, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and ethanol in the aqueous phase during the formation of vesicles suggest that the multilayer formation can be hastened in some cases. Atomic force microscopic study corroborate the thicknesses that range between 8 and 20 nm for high concentration of electrolytes or ethanol suggesting coalescence of vesicles leading to several bilayers possibly stacked over each other.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, the interfacial and bulk behaviour of the amphiphiles hexadecylammonium bromide and its methyl and ethanolic head group analogues in buffered aqueous and gelatin solution has been examined. The analogues are of two categories: the methyl and the combined methyl and ethanolic head group representatives are considered as Group A compounds, and all non-methyl but ethanolic head group species are taken as Group B compounds. Different physical techniques have been employed to ascertain the amphiphilic behaviour in solution. The self-aggregation of these surfactants at different pH has been studied along with pH dependent interfacial activity of gelatin. The interaction of the two categories of the surfactants with gelatin at different pH has been investigated. A scheme for this interaction at various stages of the process has been proposed. The influence of the surfactant head groups on the interaction process has been assessed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A computational study for the [2 + 1] addition of the lithium carbenoids LiCH<sub>2</sub>X (X = Cl, Br, I) with ketene have been investigated by means of the B3LYP hybrid density functional method. All the reactions examined displayed similar concerted mechanisms for the cyclopropanation of these reagents. The lithium carbenoids react with ketene via an asynchronous attack on one CH<sub>2</sub> or C group of ketene with relatively low barrier to reaction in the range of 25.34-33.74 kJ/mol in THF solvent. The trend of the lithium carbenoids reaction barrier with ketene is LiCH<sub>2</sub>Cl &#60; LiCH<sub>2</sub>Br &#60; LiCH<sub>2</sub>I. The results show that the reactions could be highly chemical reactivity with low barriers and could be favoured in experiment. The reactions could proceed easily at lower temperature. The computational results are briefly compared to other carbenoid reactions and related species.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>ZrMCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieves were synthesized by using the zirconium sulfate as zirconium source and using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as a template under microwave irradiation condition. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductive coupled plasma (ICP) technique, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and N<sub>2</sub> physical adsorption, respectively. The effect of the different initial ZrO<sub>2</sub> : SiO<sub>2</sub> molar ratio, the different thermal treatment temperature and hydrothermal treatment time on textural property was investigated. The results show that the obtained products possess a typical mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and have specific surface areas in the range of 598.1 ‚àº  971.4 m<sup>2</sup>/g and average pore sizes in the range of ca. 2.46 ‚àº  3.43 nm. On the other hand, the BET specific surface area and pore volume of the synthesized ZrMCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieve decrease with the increased amount of zirconium incorporated in the starting material, the rise of thermal treatment temperature and the prolonging of hydrothermal treatment time, the mesoporous ordering deteriorates. The mesoporous structure of the ZrMCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieve still retains after calcination at 750&#176;C for 3 h or hydrothermal treatment at 100&#176;C for 6 days, however, the mesoporous ordering is poor.</p>

					<p>Nano-sized Pt-Ru supported onto a mixed-conducting polymer composite comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulphonic acid (PEDOT-PSSA) is employed as anode in a solid-polymer-electrolyte direct methanol fuel cell (SPE-DMFC) and its performance compared with the SPE-DMFC employing conventional Vulcan XC-72R carbon supported Pt-Ru anode. Physical characterization of the catalyst is conducted by Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) in conjunction with cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The study suggests that PEDOT-PSSA to be a promising alternative catalyst-support-material for SPE-DMFCs.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0391-0400</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article, the interaction between ùõº-Chymotrypsin and CdTe QDs was investigated by fluorescence, synchronous fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic methods at pH 7.20 and pH 9.05. The intrinsic fluorescence of ùõº-Chy is quenched by CdTe QDs. Under different pH conditions, the level of binding constants is determined to be 10<sup>3</sup> from fluorescence data. The hydrogen bond or van der Waals force is involved in the binding process when pH is 9.05, while the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions play main role in the binding process when pH is 7.20. The red-shift of synchronous fluorescence spectral peak of protein after the addition of CdTe QDs reveals that the microenvironments around tryptophan residues are disturbed by CdTe QDs. The secondary structure of ùõº-Chy undergoes slight changes as similar by far-UV CD data. The activity and stability of ùõº-Chy in the presence of CdTe QDs were also studied. ùõº-Chy can maintain its high activity and stability under different pH conditions for 24 h in the presence of CdTe QDs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The NO electro-oxidation was investigated at various single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) modified electrodes by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared with the glassy carbon electrode, the SWCNTs modified electrodes possess higher electro-catalytic activity to NO electro-oxidation. CV results indicate that the peak current density of NO electro-oxidation at the SWCNT-COOH (SWCNTs with carboxyl groups) modified electrode is the highest and the peak potential is the most negative among the four kinds of electrodes. EIS indicates that the charge transfer resistance of NO electro-oxidation at the SWCNT-COOH modified electrode is the least. The determined factors (charge transfer and mass transfer of diffusion) of NO electro-oxidation are different in varied potential region. The mechanism of NO electro-oxidation reaction at the SWCNTs modified electrodes is also discussed.</p>

				<title>Interplay between multiple length and time scales in complex chemical systems</title>
				<feature>Perspective Article</feature>
				<page>0459-0470</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Processes in complex chemical systems, such as macromolecules, electrolytes, interfaces, micelles and enzymes, can span several orders of magnitude in length and time scales. The length and time scales of processes occurring over this broad time and space window are frequently coupled to give rise to the control necessary to ensure specificity and the uniqueness of the chemical phenomena. A combination of experimental, theoretical and computational techniques that can address a multiplicity of length and time scales is required in order to understand and predict structure and dynamics in such complex systems. This review highlights recent experimental developments that allow one to probe structure and dynamics at increasingly smaller length and time scales. The key theoretical approaches and computational strategies for integrating information across time-scales are discussed. The application of these ideas to understand phenomena in various areas, ranging from materials science to biology, is illustrated in the context of current developments in the areas of liquids and solvation, protein folding and aggregation and phase transitions, nucleation and self-assembly.</p>

				<title>Study of multi-site chemical exchange in solution state by NMR: 1D experiments with multiply selective excitation</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0471-0480</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical exchange in solution state has been investigated traditionally by both 1D and 2D NMR, permitting the extraction of kinetic parameters (e.g. the spin-lattice relaxation time $T_1$, the exchange rate constant ùëò and the activation parameters). This work demonstrates a simple 1D NMR approach employing multiply selective excitation to study multi-site exchange processes in solution, applying it to systems that exhibit three-site exchange. This approach involves simultaneous excitation of all - or a chosen subset of - the exchanging sites by using an appropriately modulated shaped radiofrequency pulse. The pulse sequence, as well as analysis is summarized. Significant features of the experiment, which relies on sign labelling of the exchanging sites, include considerably shorter experiment time compared to standard 2D exchange work, clear definition of the exchange time window and uniform pulse non-ideality effects for all the exchanging sites. Complete kinetic information is reported in the study of dynamic processes in superacid solutions of two weak bases, studied by <sup>1</sup>H NMR. An analytical solution, leading to the determination of four rate parameters, is presented for proton exchange studies on these systems, which involve a mixture of two weak bases in arbitrary concentration ratio, and stoichiometric excess of the superacid.</p>

				<title>Excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction of 4-(morpholenyl) benzonitrile in solution: Effects of hetero atom in the donor moiety</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0481-0490</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) molecule with an extra hetero atom in its donor moiety has been synthesized in order to investigate how ICT reaction is affected by hetero atom replacement. Photo-physical and photo-dynamical properties of this molecule, 4-(morpholenyl)benzonitrile (M6C), have been studied in 20 different solvents. The correlation between the reaction driving force ($-\Delta G_r$) and activation barrier ($\Delta G$<sup>&#35;</sup>) has been explored in order to understand the solvent effects (static and dynamic) on the photo-excited ICT reaction in this molecule. A Kramer‚Äôs model analysis of the experimentally observed reaction rate constants indicates a solvent-averaged activation barrier of $\sim 4 k_BT$ in the absence of solvent dynamical control. The reaction in M6C is therefore not a barrier-less reaction but close to the limit where conventional kinetics might break down.</p>

				<title>A quantum-classical simulation of the nuclear dynamics in NO$^-_2$ and C<sub>6</sub>H$^+_6$ with realistic model Hamiltonian</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0491-0510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We perform the nuclear dynamics simulation to calculate the broad band as well as better resolved (a) <i>photodetachment</i> spectra of nitrogen dioxide anion (NO$^-_2$), and (b) <i>photoelectron</i> spectra of benzene radical cation (C<sub>6</sub>H$^+_6$) with <i>degeneracy</i> among the electronic states using our <i>parallelized</i> time dependent discrete variable representation approach. For this purpose, we first consider a theoretical model that describes the photodetachment spectrum originating due to the Franck-Condon (FC) transition from the anionic ground state to the conically intersecting $\widetilde{X}^2 A_1 - \widetilde{A}^2 B_2$ electronic manifold of the neutral NO<sub>2</sub>, whereas two multi-state, multi-mode model Hamiltonians of C<sub>6</sub>H$^+_6$ with degeneracy among the electronic states are explored for its‚Äô photoelectron spectra. The dynamics of C<sub>6</sub>H$^+_6$ has been carried out with two Hamiltonians: (a) one consists with <i>four states and nine modes</i>, and (b) the other is constituted with <i>three states and seven modes</i>. Since the electronic states of both the systems are interconnected by several conical intersections in the vicinity of the FC region, it would be challenging to persue the dynamical calculation due to the impact of non-adiabaticity among the electronic states. The spectral profiles obtained with the advent of TDDVR approach show reasonably good agreement with the results obtained by other theoretical methodologies and experimental measurements.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0511-0519</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Single crystals of (ùëÜ)-phenylsuccinic acid (SPSA) were grown by the slow evaporation technique and vibrational spectral analysis was carried out using near-IR Fourier transform Raman and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. The density functional theoretical (DFT) computations were also performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d, p) level to derive the equilibrium geometry, vibrational wavenumbers and intensities. Vibrational spectral investigation confirmed the formation of cyclic dimers in the crystal, with the carboxyl groups of each acid molecule being hydrogen bonded to those of the adjacent molecules. The Raman vibrational wavenumbers of the adsorption geometry of (S)-phenylsuccinic acid (SPSA) on a silver surface have been simulated using DFT-B3PW91 with lanl2dz basis set and it compared with the experimental spectrum. The large enhancement of in-plane bending and ring breathing modes in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectrum indicates that the molecule is adsorbed on the silver surface in an `at least vertical‚Äô or slightly tilted orientation, with the ring perpendicular to the silver surface. The calculated vibrational spectra are in agreement with experimental values confirming the validity of the proposed adsorption configurations.</p>

				<title>The solvent and substituent effects on bond dissociation energies of NO-donor molecules containing the N-NO bond</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum chemical calculations are used to estimate the equilibrium N-NO bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for 15 NO-donor molecules in acetonitrile. These compounds are studied by employing the hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP, B3PW91, B3P86) methods together with 6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> basis set. The basis set superposition error (BSSE) and zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) are considered. The results are compared with the available experimental results. It is demonstrated that B3LYP/6-31G$^{\ast\ast}$ is accurate to compute the reliable BDEs for the NO-donor molecules. The solvent effects on the N-NO BDEs are analysed and the result shows that the N-NO BDEs in a vacuum computed by B3P86/6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> method are the closest to the computed values in acetontrile and the average solvent effect is 0.78 kcal/mol. Subsequently, the substituent effects on the N-NO BDEs are further analysed and it is found that electron donating group stabilizes the radical and as a result BDE decreases; whereas electron withdrawing group stabilizes the ground state of the molecule and thus increases the BDE.</p>

					<p>We have investigated the structure and magnetic properties of the perovskite oxides of the formula La<sub>2</sub>Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_{2x}$Cr$_{1-x}$O<sub>6</sub> ($0 &#60; x &#60;  1.0$). For $0 &#60; x  &#8804;  0.5$, the members adopt the orthorhombic (<i>Pbnm</i>) structure, where the transition metal atoms are disordered at the 4b sites and the MO<sub>6</sub> (M = Fe, Mn, Cr) octahedra become increasingly distorted with increasing ùë•. For $0.65 &#8804;  x &#60; 1.0$, the members adopt the rhombohedral (R-3c) structure that is similar to LaMnO$_{3+\delta}$ ($\delta &#8805; 0.1$) where the MO<sub>6</sub> octahedra are undistorted. While the magnetic properties of the latter series are largely similar to the parent LaMnO$_{3+\delta}$ arising from the double-exchange (DE) between mixed valent Mn<sup>III</sup>/Mn<sup>IV</sup>, the magnetic properties of the orthorhombic members show a distinct (albeit weak) ferromagnetism ($T_C \sim 200$ K) that seems to arise from a Mn<sup>III</sup>-mediated superexchange (SE) between Fe<sup>III</sup>/Cr<sup>III</sup> in the disordered perovskite structure containing Fe<sup>III</sup>, Mn<sup>III</sup> and Cr<sup>III</sup>.</p>

The number of steps and, in particular, the starting temperature of decomposition of these complexes depends on the equatorial ligand. Also, formation constants of the complexes have been determined by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy through titration of the ligands with the metal ions at constant ionic strength (0.1 M NaClO<sub>4</sub>) and at 25&#176;C. According to the thermodynamic studies, as the steric character of the ligand increases, the complexation tendency to VO(IV) center decreases.

				<abstract>
					<p>Efficient use of the readily accessible chiral $C_2$-symmetric acyclic diamines (<b>1-2</b>) as well as macrocyclic amines (<b>3-5</b>) containing <i>trans</i>-1,2-diaminocyclohexyl moiety as chiral solvating agents (CSA) for the determination of enantiomeric excess of representative carboxylic acids (<b>6-7</b>) and an amino acid derivative (<b>8</b>) is illustrated. The enantiomeric composition of different carboxylic acids estimated here by the <sup>1</sup>H NMR method, based on the integration of the corresponding methine proton signals are in good correlation with that determined using HPLC method. The data are in accordance with the formation of multimolecular diastereomeric complexes in solution, which render good splitting of NMR signals for the enantiomers of representative carboxylic acids as well as for ùëÅ-Ts-phenylglycine (up to $\Delta \Delta \delta = 0.295$ ppm, 118 Hz).</p>

				<title>Generation of nitryl chloride from chlorotrimethylsilane-acetyl nitrate reaction: A one-pot preparation of <i>gem</i>-chloronitro compounds from oximes</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0571-0577</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>While <i>iso</i>-amyl nitrite reacts with chlorotrimethylsilane to give NOCl, <i>iso</i>-amyl nitrate does not yield NO<sub>2</sub>Cl with silicon reagent. However, acetyl nitrate reacts successfully with chlorotrimethylsilane to give nitryl chloride, which is characterized by its UV spectrum. If it is generated in presence of ketoximes, <i>gem</i>-chloronitro as well as <i>gem</i>-chloronitroso compounds are formed in almost equal amounts, which together account for up to 80&#37; yield. This is possibly the simplest one-pot reaction for the preparation of <i>gem</i>-chloronitro compounds which find several synthetic applications. If NO<sub>2</sub>Cl is generated in presence of cycloalkenes, the corresponding 1,2-dichlorocycloalkanes are obtained. Considering the evidence in hand, it is proposed that NO<sub>2</sub>Cl, initially formed by chlorotrimethylsilane-acetyl nitrate reaction, decomposes to Cl<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Then chlorine reacts with oximes to produce first <i>gem</i>-chloronitroso compounds, which are oxidized by NO<sub>2</sub>Cl or N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to <i>gem</i>-chloronitro compounds, and with cycloalkenes it gives dichlorocycloalkanes.</p>

					<p>High resolution <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR resonance assignments and conformational assignments were carried out for four $t(3)$-benzyl-$r$(2),ùëê(6)-<i>bis</i>(aryl)piperidin-4-ones <b>1-4</b> and their four ùëÅ-nitroso-$t(3)$-benzyl-$r(2)$,$c(6)$-<i>bis</i>(aryl)piperidin-4-ones <b>5-8</b>. In addition to conventional 1D NMR methods, 2D shiftcorrelated NMR techniques (<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H COSY and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C COSY) were used for signal assignments. At room temperature the $t(3)$-benzyl-$r(2)$,$c(6)$-<i>bis</i>(aryl)piperidin-4-ones <b>1-4</b> exist in only one isomeric form whereas their ùëÅ-nitroso derivatives <b>5-8</b> exist in two isomeric forms. The preferred conformations of both the isomeric forms of nitrosamines were determined by comparison of the spectral data with those of the corresponding parent amines <b>1-4</b> and with the aid of substituent parameters. The results indicate the presence of an equilibrium mixture of boat forms <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>B</b><sub>2</sub> for Z isomers of <b>5-8</b>.

				<abstract>
					<p>Mordenite (HM) catalysts with three different Si/Al ratios were compared for their activity and selectivities in gas phase toluene isopropylation with isopropanol. Catalyst with Si/Al ratio 44.9 offered better cumene selectivity, hence, it was chosen for detailed kinetic investigations. The influence of various process parameters like temperature, time-on-stream, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), reactant mole ratio on this catalyst activity are discussed. The cymene selectivity was found to increase with reaction temperature and passed through a maximum at 473 K. The deactivation with time-onstream is almost negligible. Lower isopropyl alcohol concentration in the feed improved cymene selectivity. The conversion and selectivity to cymenes were compared with those of the large pore beta catalyst. The rate constant and activation energy were found to be 7.34 m<sup>3</sup>/kg h and 41.84 kJ/mol, respectively using homogeneous kinetic model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The cyclo-dehydrogenation of ethylene diamine and propylene glycol to 2-methylpyrazine was performed under the atmospheric conditions at 380&#176;C. The Cr-promoted Cu-Zn/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and characterized by ICP-AES, N<sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption, XRD, XPS, N<sub>2</sub>O chemisorption, TPR and NH3-TPD techniques. The amorphous chromium species existing in Cu-Zn-Cr/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst enhanced the dispersion of active component Cu, promoted the reduction of catalyst. Furthermore, the catalytic performance was significantly improved. The acidity of the catalyst played an important role in increasing the 2-MP selectivity. To optimize the reaction parameters, influences of different chromium content, reaction temperature, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), reactants molar ratio and time on stream on the product pattern were studied. The results demonstrated that addition of chromium promoter revealed satisfying catalytic activity, stability and selectivity of 2-methylpyrazine.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0639-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synergistic inhibition of corrosion of carbon steel in low chloride aqueous medium using tungstate as a synergist in combination with $N,N-bis$(phosphonomethyl) glycine (BPMG) and zinc ions is presented. The synergistic action of tungstate has been established through the present studies. The new ternary inhibitor formulation is effective in neutral and slightly acidic as well as slightly alkaline media. Potentiodynamic polarisation studies inferred that the formulation functions as a mixed inhibitor. Impedance studies of the metal/solution interface revealed that the surface film is highly protective. Characterisation by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the surface film formed in presence of the inhibitor revealed the presence of iron, phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, zinc and tungsten in the surface film. The chemical shifts in the binding energies of these elements inferred that the surface film is composed of iron oxides/hydroxides, zinc hydroxide, heteropolynuclear complex [Fe(III), Zn(II)-BPMG] and WO<sub>3</sub>. Reflection absorption FTIR spectroscopic studies also supported the presence of these compounds in the surface film. Morphological features of the metal surface studied in the absence and presence of the inhibitor by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are also presented. Based on all these results, a plausible mechanism of corrosion inhibition is proposed.</p>

				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0651-0659</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, controlled release of diclofenac sodium (DS) from pH-sensitive carrageenan-gpoly(acrylic acid) superabsorbent hydrogels was investigated. The hydrogels were prepared by graft copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) onto kappa-carrageenan, using ammonium persulfate (APS) as a free radical initiator in the presence of methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) as a crosslinker. Infrared spectroscopy was carried out to confirm the chemical structure of the hydrogel. Moreover, morphology of the samples was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The synthesized hydrogels were subjected to equilibrium swelling studies in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (SGF and SIF). Hydrogels containing drug DS, at different drug-to-polymer ratios, were prepared by direct adsorption method. The loading yield was found to depend on both the impregnation time and the amount of encapsulated drug. In vitro drug-release studies in different buffer solutions showed that the most important parameter affecting the drug-release behaviour of hydrogels is the pH of the solution. The mechanism involved in release was Fickian ($n &#8804;  0.43$, $n = 0.348$) and Super Case II kinetics ($n &#62; 1$, $n = 1.231$) at pH 1.2 and 7.4, respectively.</p>

				<title>Crystal engineering: A brief overview</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0667-0675</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Crystal structures of organic and metal-organic compounds have been determined in enormous numbers over the past century, and at the time of writing this review, the Cambridge Structural Database has just crossed the half million mark. The possibility of designing a particular crystal packing is, however, of more recent origin and the subject of <i>crystal engineering</i> has addressed this possibility, more or less systematically, during the past 30 years. Crystal engineering demands a detailed and thorough knowledge of intermolecular interactions, which act as the supramolecular glue that binds molecules into crystals. It also requires systematic strategies for the design of a crystal, the architectural blueprint as it were. Finally, this enterprise needs to be geared towards a useful property in that the crystal that is being designed is a functional one. All these features of the subject are directly or indirectly connected with the fact that there is a very large database of known crystal structures that is available to the crystal engineer. This review attempts to briefly survey the current scenario in this expanding subject.</p>

				<title>Analysis of Cl‚Ä¶Cl and C-H‚Ä¶Cl intermolecular interactions involving chlorine in substituted 2-chloroquinoline derivatives</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0677-0685</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Six crystal structures of substituted 2-chloroquinoline derivatives have been analysed to evaluate the role of Cl atom as a self recognizing unit resulting in the formation of Cl‚Ä¶Cl and C-H‚Ä¶Cl interactions to generate supramolecular assembly in the solid state. The features of Type I and Type II geometries associated with Cl‚Ä¶Cl interactions have been analysed to show directional preferences leading to differences in the packing motifs in these crystal structures. C-H‚Ä¶Cl interactions are generated exclusively in structures depicting Type II Cl‚Ä¶Cl interaction have been observed in these structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Tetrakis(2,6-dimethyl-4-acetoxyphenyl)pyrene <b>H2</b> containing flexible acetate functionalities at the para positions of sterically-hindered and rigid aryl rings functions as an inclusion host system. Depending on the orientations of the acetate functionalities, a variety of conformers may indeed be expected. A limited number of the crystal structures of the inclusions compounds of <b>H2</b> reveal that one indeed observes 2 different conformations for the host based on the orientations of the acetate functionalities. The inclusion compound of <b>H2</b> with benzene guest molecules is particularly appealing in terms of how the latter are held in trough domains of the host by weak C‚àíH$\cdots$O and C‚àíH$\cdots \pi$ hydrogen bonds. More experimentation and analyses of crystal structures of such systems is expected to lead to better insights toward realizing multicomponent molecular crystals in a rational manner.</p>

					<p>The reactions of <i>bis</i>(pyridylcarboxamido)alkanes (amides) and <i>bis</i>(3-pyridyl)alkanediamides (reverse amides) with copper(II) and zinc(II) in the presence of various anions resulted in onedimensional polymeric crystalline complexes with or without guest inclusion. The crystal structure analyses of these complexes reveal that the one-dimensional networks observed here are of three types: simple linear chain, chains with wavy nature and chains containing cavities. The self-complementary amide groups of the ligands assembled these coordination networks into higher dimensional architectures via N-H$\cdots$O hydrogen bonds.</p>

A detailed packing analysis has been undertaken to delineate the role of second sphere C-H$\cdots$F and C-H$\cdots$O interactions amid other heteroatom interactions. The complex salts have been characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic studies (IR, UV/Visible, multinuclear NMR), conductance and solubility product measurements. Single crystal X-ray structure determination revealed ionic structures of both the complex salts having discrete ions along with lattice water molecules. Crystal lattice is stabilized by a variety of hydrogen bonding interactions, i.e. O-H$\cdots$O, C-H$\cdots$O and C-H$\cdots$F involving second sphere coordination besides ùúã-ùúã interaction. Furthermore, packing analyses reveal that C-H‚Ä¶F interactions can manifest even in the presence of a large number of heteroatom interactions.</p>

				<title>Distinguishing crystallite size effects from those of structural disorder on the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of layered materials</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0751-0756</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both crystallite size effects and structural disorder contribute to the broadening of lines in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of layered materials. Stacking faults, in particular, are ubiquitous in layered materials and aside from broadening also induce peaks due to select reflections to shift away from the Bragg positions. The effect of structural disorder has to be suitably discounted before the application of the Scherrer formula for the estimation of crystallite size.</p>

				<title>Crystallization of copper(II) sulfate based minerals and MOF from solution: Chemical insights into the supramolecular interactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0757-0769</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Crystallization of solids, molecular or non-molecular from solution is a supramolecular reaction. Nucleation of a lattice structure at supersaturation can be conceived to result from a critical nucleus, a high energy intermediate (supramolecular transition state). Conceptualization of a structure for the critical nucleus in terms of aggregation of tectons through non-covalent interactions provides chemical insights into the architecture of a solid. The retrosynthetic analysis of copper-based minerals and materials offers an elegant description for the crystal packing. It addresses the influence of the geometry, functionality and reactivity of copper tecton(s) in directing a specific supramolecular aggregation. The mechanistic approach provides guiding principles to chemists to account for the experimentally crystallized solids and a platform to practice structure-synthesis correlation. Rationalization of the same composition with different atomic arrangements (polymorphs), compositional variation leading to different pseudopolymorphs, degree of hydration (anhydrous to hydrated), water clusters, role of solvent, etc. can all be justified on molecular basis. Also, the method gives predictive components including directions to synthesize new solids. In a nutshell, the paper is an attempt to generalize the crystallization of inorganic solids from solution by recognizing supramolecular interactions between metal tectons and gain insights for designing new MOF.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The metal ions (Ti<sup>+4</sup>, Mg<sup>+2</sup>, Zn<sup>+2</sup> and Co<sup>+2</sup>) have been substituted in place of Al$^{+3}$ in aluminophosphates (AlPOs). These compounds were used for the first time as possible photocatalysts for the degradation of organic dyes. Among the doped AlPOs, ZnAlPO-5, CoAlPO-5, MgAlPO-11, 18 and 36 did not show any photocatalytic activity. MgAlPO-5 showed photocatalytic activity and different loading of Mg (4, 8, 12 atom &#37; of Mg) were investigated. The activity can be enhanced by the increasing of concentration of the doped metal ions. TiAlPO-5 (4, 8, 12 atom &#37; of Ti) showed the highest photocatalytic activity among all the compounds and its activity was compared to that of Degussa P25 (TiO<sub>2</sub>). The activity of photocatalysts was correlated with the diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectra.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>New Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) type phase LaSr<sub>2</sub>MnCrO<sub>7</sub> has been synthesized by ceramic method. Rietveld profile analysis shows that the phase crystallizes with tetragonal unit cell in the space group I4/mmm. The electrical resistivity of the phase has been measured in the temperature range of 10-300 K using Leybold closed cycle helium cryostat. The phase shows insulator-metal (I-M) transition at low temperature, the phenomenon often associated with giant magnetoresistance. 3D variable range hopping governs the electrical conduction in the insulator region above the I-M transition temperature. Magnetic susceptibility of the phase has been measured in the temperature range of 100-300 K. Magnetic studies suggest that the phase is ferromagnetic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The optically active tetra-ùõΩ-[(ùëÜ)-2-octanyloxy]-substituted copper and nickel phthalocyanines were synthesized via a two-step route with 4-nitro-phthalonitrile and (ùëÜ)-2-octanol as the starting materials. Both compounds are fully characterized by MS, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, UV-Vis, IR, CD and elemental analysis, and soluble in common organic solvents except methanol. The results showed that they were dispersed into single molecules in chloroform and dichloromethane, but prone to congregate into H-type aggregates in ethanol and diethyl ether. They assembled to H-type aggregates with left-handed helix when deposited as thin films.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The photophysical behaviour of N-(2-hydroxy benzylidene) aniline or most commonly known as salicylideneaniline (SA) has been investigated using the <i>ab initio</i> and DFT levels of theory. The quantum chemical calculations show that the optimized non planar enol ($C_1$) form of the SA molecule is the most stable conformer in the ground state and is marked by the twisting of the phenolic and anilino rings of the molecule. The geometry optimizations and the subsequent frequency calculations of the excited singlet electronic states of the various tautomeric forms of SA molecule were performed with the CIS level of theory. A detail theoretical investigation on the relaxation dynamics of the SA molecule has been presented. Possible explanation on the excitation wavelength dependence of the photochromic yield of the molecule is also reported.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bulk and interfacial properties of ion-pair amphiphiles (IPA), formed between sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and ùëõ-alkyltrimethylammonium bromide homologues (C$_n$TAB; ùëõ = 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18), have been investigated. Different phases and aggregated states, formed in the ternary combinations of C$_n$TAB/SDS/H<sub>2</sub>O, have been identified and described. Equimolar mixture of IPAs in water yielded precipitates, in the form of coacervates. Aqueous solubility of isolated coacervates in presence and absence of additives like cholesterol and bile salts have been examined. The isolated coacervates have been characterized by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, FTIR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarization microscopic measurements. The coacervates have appeared in the shape of needle and complex flower-like aggregates. Surface pressure (ùúã)-area (A) isotherm of the coacervates at the air/water interface have been constructed and compared with the lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-$sn$-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). Morphologies of the IPA monolayers at different surface pressures have been also examined by epifluorescence microscopy. The compressed interfacial monolayers have produced spherical (both regular and irregular) and fern-leaf like domains.</p>

				<title>Directed 2-dimensional organisation of collagen: Role of cross-linking and denaturing agents</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0881-0889</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of additives like curcumin and surfactants on the self-assembly of collagen from a simple 2-dimensional system of Langmuir films of the protein at air/solution interface has been attempted in this study using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and dynamic surface tensiometer. Though pure curcumin is not surface active, a synergistic effect of collagen with curcumin seems to lead to enhanced surface activity in the protein. In general, the presence of additives, increases the surface activity of collagen even for the lowest concentration and the largest change in surface activity is seen for collagen with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The results suggest interplay between the unexposed hydrophobic groups, and the opening out and solvation of the more charged or polar groups at the surface leading to aggregation followed by self-assembly. Modulation of aggregation at interface in collagen due to these additives may be an approach that could be explored for possible applications in bio-materials and for delivery of protein-drug complexes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of amino acid, kinetin (KNT) by diperiodatoargentate(III) (DPA) in alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of 0.5 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> was studied spectrophtometrically. The reaction between KNT and DPA in alkaline medium exhibits 1 : 3 stoichiometry (KNT : DPA). Intervention of free radicals was observed in the reaction. Based on the observed orders and experimental evidences, a mechanism involving the monoperiodatoargentate(III) (MPA) as the reactive oxidant species has been proposed. The products, furon-2-methanol and para-nitro-purine were identified by spot test and characterized by spectral studies. The rate constants and associated activation parameters for the proposed mechanism as well as the thermodynamic quantities for different equilibrium steps are reported and discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nucleophilic halogenalkylation reactions of propylene oxide with halogenmethane anion (CH<sub>2</sub>X<sup>-</sup>) and dihalogenmethane anion (CHX$^-_2$) (X = F, Cl) in the gas phase and in the Et<sub>2</sub>O solvent are studied using the B3LYP method and the SCIPCM model for simulating solution effects. Our calculations predict the same reaction path for following reactions: (1) (X = F, Cl) and (2) (X = F) in the two phases, but there is a little difference in the relative energy of IM1(2Cl) in the gas phase and in the Et<sub>2</sub>O solvent for reaction (2) (X = Cl). All the four reactions proceed in two steps. Reactions (1) and (2) are predicted to be exothermic and thermodynamically favourable in both the gas phase and the Et<sub>2</sub>O solvent. The overall barrier energies for reaction (1) (X = F), reaction (1) (X = Cl), reaction (2) (X = F), and reaction (2) (X = Cl) are predicted to be 2.74 and 4.08 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, 3.35 and 5.20 kcal $mol^{-1}$, 4.67 and 6.05 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, and 5.33 and 8.23 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> in the gas phase and in the Et<sub>2</sub>O solvent, respectively. The accurate calculation of results for the model systems would be useful for experimental researchers working in this field.</p>

				<title>Gold electrode modified by self-assembled monolayers of thiols to determine DNA sequences hybridization</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0911-0917</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The process of immobilization of biological molecules is one of the most important steps in the construction of a biosensor. In the case of DNA, the way it exposes its bases can result in electrochemical signals to acceptable levels. The use of self-assembled monolayer that allows a connection to the gold thiol group and DNA binding to an aldehydic ligand resulted in the possibility of determining DNA hybridization. Immobilized single strand of DNA (ssDNA) from calf thymus pre-formed from alkanethiol film was formed by incubating a solution of 2-aminoethanothiol (Cys) followed by glutaraldehyde (Glu). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to characterize the self-assembled monolayer on the gold electrode and, also, to study the immobilization of ssDNA probe and hybridization with the complementary sequence (target ssDNA). The ssDNA probe presents a well-defined oxidation peak at +0.158 V. When the hybridization occurs, this peak disappears which confirms the efficacy of the annealing and the DNA double helix performing without the presence of electroactive indicators. The use of SAM resulted in a stable immobilization of the ssDNA probe, enabling the hybridization detection without labels. This study represents a promising approach for molecular biosensor with sensible and reproducible results.</p>

				<title>Voltammetric determination of theophylline at a Nafion/multi-wall carbon nanotubes composite film-modified glassy carbon electrode</title>
				<feature>Full Papers</feature>
				<page>0919-0926</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A Nafion/multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) composite film-modified electrode was fabricated and applied to the sensitive and convenient determination of theophylline (TP). Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were easily dispersed homogeneously into 0.1&#37; Nafion methanol solution by sonication. Appropriate amount of Nafion/MWNTs suspension was coated on a glassy carbon electrode. After evaporating methanol, a Nafion/MWNTs composite film-modified electrode was achieved. TP could effectively accumulate at Nafion/MWNTs composite film-modified electrode and cause a sensitive anodic peak at around 1180 mV (vs SCE) in 0.01 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium (pH 1.8). In contrast with the bare glassy carbon electrode, Nafion film-modified electrode, Nafion/MWNTs film-modified electrode could remarkably increase the anodic peak current and decreased the overpotential of TP oxidation. Under the optimized conditions, the anodic peak current was proportional to TP concentration in the range of $8.0  \times  10^{-8}-6.0 \times 10^{-5}$ mol/L, with a detection limit of $2.0 \times  10^{-8}$ mol/L. This newly developed method was used to determine TP in drug samples with good percentage of recoveries.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Scheelite type solid electrolytes, Li<sub>0.5</sub>Ce$_{0.5‚àíx}$Ln$_x$MoO<sub>4</sub> ($x = 0$ and 0.25, Ln = Pr, Sm) have been synthesized using a solid state method. Their structure and ionic conductivity (ùúé) were obtained by single  crystal X-ray diffraction and ac-impedance spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray diffraction studies reveal a space group of $I4_1/a$ for Li<sub>0.5</sub>Ce$_{0.5‚àíx}$Ln$_x$MoO<sub>4</sub> ($x = 0$ and 0.25, Ln = Pr, Sm) scheelite compounds. The unsubstituted Li<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> showed lithium ion conductivity $\sim 10^{‚àí5}-10^{‚àí3} \Omega^{‚àí1}$cm<sup>-1</sup> in the temperature range of 300-700&#176;C ($\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{‚àí3} \Omega^{‚àí1}$cm<sup>-1</sup> at 700&#176;C). The substituted compounds show lower conductivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, with the magnitude of ionic conductivity being two (in the high temperature regime) to one order (in the low temperature regime) lower than the unsubstituted compound. Since these scheelite type structures show significant conductivity, the series of compounds could serve in high temperature lithium battery operations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Laser flash photolysis study on highly fluorescent and stable salt of 9-phenylxanthenium cation in neutral condition has been carried out for the first time. A new transient absorption band of this extensively studied system that perhaps remained buried under the fluorescence envelope and hitherto undetected has been identified and attributed to the triplet state of the system. This oxygen-insensitive triplet-triplet absorption band in the 480-600 nm range is expected to trigger new studies exploring the reactivity of the triplet state of this system, which has so far received very little attention.</p>

					<p>The chemical stereodynamics for the title reaction are studied by the quasiclassical trajectory method. Employing the recent works of Deskevich, Hayes, Takahashi, Skodje, and Nesbitt (DHTSN) potential energy surface of the ground $1^2$A' electronic state, the present work calculates the polarizationdependent differential cross sections and the three angular distributions which describe the vector correlations among the product angular momentum <b>j'</b> and the reagent and the product initial relative velocities <b>k</b> and <b>k'</b>. The effect of vibrational and rotational excitations for the reagent FCl and the influence of collision energies on the stereodynamical quantities are also investigated and discussed.</p>

				<title>Metathesis of carbon dioxide and phenyl isocyanate catalysed by group(IV) metal alkoxides: An experimental and computational study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0029-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The insertion reactions of zirconium(IV) ùëõ-butoxide and titanium(IV) ùëõ-butoxide with a heterocumulene like carbodiimide, carbon dioxide or phenyl isocyanate are compared. Both give an intermediate which carries out metathesis at elevated temperatures by inserting a second heterocumulene in a head-to-head fashion. The intermediate metallacycle extrudes a new heterocumulene, different from the two that have inserted leading to metathesis. As the reaction is reversible, catalytic metathesis is feasible. In stoichiometric reactions heterocumulene insertion, metathesis and metathesis cum insertion products are observed. However, catalytic amounts of the metal alkoxide primarily led to metathesis products. It is shown that zirconium alkoxides promote catalytic metathesis (isocyanates, carbon dioxide) more efficiently than the corresponding titanium alkoxide. The difference in the metathetic activity of these alkoxides has been explained by a computational study using model complexes Ti(OMe)<sub>4</sub> (<b>1bTi</b>) and Zr(OMe)<sub>4</sub> (<b>1bZr</b>). The computation was carried out at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level of theory.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two series of click chemistry assisted alkoxymethyl-1H-[1,2,3]-triazol-1-yl containing sidechain liquid-crystalline polymethacrylates were synthesized by free radical polymerization technique. Mesogen was linked to backbone through various spacer units. Monomers and polymers were characterized by FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectral techniques. Thermal stability of polymers was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. Mesomorphic property and phase transition temperature of polymers were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical microscopy. Phase transition temperature and mesomorphic property of polymers with respect to insertion of polar alkoxy group on terminal triazole ring and spacer length between backbone and mesogen were investigated. Polymers exhibited grainy like textures under polarized optical microscopy. Spacer length between mesogen and backbone alters phase transition temperature of the polymers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The chemistry of organo-gallium and indium complexes with dithiolate and internally functionalised oxo ligands has been explored. With 1,1-dithiolate ligands both classical and organometallic complexes of gallium and indium, [M(S$^\cap$S)<sub>3</sub>], [RM(S$^\cap$S)<sub>2</sub>] and [R<sub>2</sub>M(S$^\cap$S)] (where R = Me or Et; M = Ga or In; S$^\cap$S = RCS<sub>2</sub>, ROCS<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>NCS<sub>2</sub> and (RO)<sub>2</sub>PS<sub>2</sub>) have been isolated. Reactions of internally functionalised oxo ligands with R<sub>3</sub>MR$\cdot$OEt<sub>2</sub> afforded diorganometal complexes [R<sub>2</sub>ML]$_n$. Molecular structures of several of these complexes have been established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Complexes derived from oxo ligands showed photoluminescence. They have been used as alkylating agents for C-C coupling reactions of aryl bromides in the presence of PdCl<sub>2</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Indium dithiolate complexes have been used as molecular precursors for the preparation of mono dispersed ·∫û-In<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles.</p>

				<title>Mononuclear non-heme iron(III) complexes of linear and tripodal tridentate ligands as functional models for catechol dioxygenases: Effect of ùëÅ-alkyl substitution on regioselectivity and reaction rate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0145-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Catechol dioxygenases are responsible for the last step in the biodegradation of aromatic molecules in the environment. The iron(II) active site in the extradiol-cleaving enzymes cleaves the C-C bond adjacent to the hydroxyl group, while the iron(III) active site in the intradiol-cleaving enzymes cleaves the C-C bond in between two hydroxyl groups. A series of mononuclear iron(III) complexes of the type [Fe(L)Cl<sub>3</sub>], where L is the linear ùëÅ-alkyl substituted <i>bis</i>(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)amine, ùëÅ-alkyl substituted ùëÅ-(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)ethylenediamine, linear tridentate 3N ligands containing imidazolyl moieties and tripodal ligands containing pyrazolyl moieties have been isolated and studied as structural and functional models for catechol dioxygenase enzymes. All the complexes catalyse the cleavage of catechols using molecular oxygen to afford both intra- and extradiol cleavage products. The rate of oxygenation depends on the solvent and the Lewis acidity of iron(III) center as modified by the sterically demanding ùëÅ-alkyl groups. Also, our studies reveal that stereo-electronic factors like the Lewis acidity of the iron(III) center and the steric demand of ligands, as regulated by the ùëÅ-alkyl substituents, determine the regioselectivity and the rate of dioxygenation. In sharp contrast to all these complexes, the pyrazole-containing tripodal ligand complexes yield mainly the oxidized product benzoquinone.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Transition metal coordination complexes play a vital role as catalysts in the oxidation of organic substrates including renewable chemicals in an economically viable and environmentally friendly way. Here we highlight the preparation, characterization and application of oxo-cubane complexes of cobalt(III) as oxidation catalysts using air and water as oxidants. Cobalt(III)-oxo complexes of the type Co<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CR)<sub>4</sub>L<sub>4</sub> have been prepared by a general method and these have been characterized by analytical, spectroscopic, electrochemical and crystallographic methods. These soluble complexes have shown promising utility as catalysts in the aerobic oxidation of side chains of alkylaromatic hydrocarbon compounds. Oxidation of neat ethylbenzene has shown very high conversion and selectivity for acetophenone formation. On the other hand, oxidation of ùëù-xylene has been found to yield both ùëù-toluic acid and terephthalic acid. It is also possible to oxidize ùëù-xylene in an aqueous medium under moderate applied O<sub>2</sub> pressure. Selective epoxidation of ùõº-pinene with air as the oxidant also takes place with the cobalt(III)-based homogeneous catalysts.</p>

				<title>Urea/thiourea derivatives and Zn(II)-DPA complex as receptors for anionic recognition‚ÄîA brief account</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0175-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This review covers few examples of anion complexation chemistry, with a special focus on urea/thiourea-based receptors and Zn(II)-dipicolyl amine-based receptors. This article specially focuses on structural aspects of the receptors and the anions for obtaining the desire specificity along with an efficient receptor-anion interaction. Two types of receptors have been described in this brief account; first one being the strong hydrogen bond donor urea/thiourea derivatives, which binds the anionic analytes through hydrogen bonded interactions; while, the second type of receptors are coordination complexes, where the coordination of the anion to the metal centre. In both the cases the anion binding modulate the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and thereby the spectroscopic response. Appropriate choice of the signalling unit may allow probing the anion binding phenomena through visual detection.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, structure and applications of [<i>cis</i>-dioxomolybdenum(VI)-(ONO)] type complexes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0187-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oxo-molybdenum chemistry is of great interest since such units are found in the active sites of a majority of molybdo-enzymes. In order to mimic the biological systems, a number of oxo-molybdenum complexes have been synthesised and studied. This review describes synthesis, structure and applications of oxomolybdenum complexes particularly <i>cis</i>-MoO<sub>2</sub>(<b>L</b>)(D) where <b>L</b> stands for a dianionic tridentate ONO ligand and D for a donor solvent molecule/monodentate ligand. The ligand moieties are derived from Schiff base, hydrazide Schiff base and other related tridentate ligands <b>L</b>(H)<sub>2</sub>. The coordination geometry around the Mo center in these complexes can be best described as a distorted octahedron in which the ONO-tridentate ligand occupies meridional position with two anionic oxygen donors mutually <i>trans</i> and are <i>cis</i> to the oxygen centers of the <i>cis</i>-dioxo group. Mostly the applications of <i>cis</i>-MoO<sub>2</sub>-(ONO) type complexes seen in literature are oxo transfer reactions like epoxidation, sulfoxidation and phosphine oxidation reactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Porphyrin rings containing two meso-pyridyl groups either in cis or trans fashion can be used to construct Re(I) bridged multiporphyrin assemblies. The <i>cis</i>-dipyridyl porphyrins with various porphyrin cores such as N<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>O, N<sub>3</sub>S, N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> have been used to react with Re(CO)<sub>5</sub>Cl in THF at refluxing temperature and constructed planar Re(I) bridged porphyrin dyads containing either one type of porphyrin subunit or two types of porphyrin subunits. The <i>trans</i>-dipyridyl porphyrins have been used to construct Re(I) bridged porphyrin squares. The porphyrin dyads have been explored for singlet-singlet energy transfer studies and porphyrin squares have been used for catalysis, chemical sensing, molecular sieving and photocurrent production studies. An overview of synthesis of Re(I) bridged porphyrin dyads, triads and tetrads and their interesting photophysical properties are highlighted in this paper.</p>

					<p>The design of structural and functional models of enzymes vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases (VHPO) and the isolation and/or generation of species having {VO(H<sub>2</sub>O)}, {VO<sub>2</sub>}, {VO(OH)} and {VO(O<sub>2</sub>)} cores, proposed as intermediate(s) during catalytic action, in solution have been studied. Catalytic potential of these complexes have been tested for oxo-transfer as well as oxidative bromination and sulfide oxidation reactions. Some of the oxidovanadium(IV) and dioxidovanadium(V) complexes have been immobilized on polymer support in order to improve their recycle ability during catalytic activities and turn over number. The formulations of the polymer-anchored complexes are based on the respective neat complexes and conclusions drawn from the various characterization studies. These catalysts have successfully been used for all catalytic reactions mentioned above. These catalysts are stable and recyclable.</p>

					<p>This article describes an account of some of our polyoxometalate (POM)-based research, we have been doing in our laboratory last several years. There are several well-defined POM cluster anions, that are structurally characterized. We have chosen Anderson-type of heteropolyanion [Al(OH)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>]$^{3‚àí}$ and explored its linking propensity in different dimensions using `s', `d' and `f' block elements as linkers.We have demonstrated how a lanthanide linker provides a new pathway in forming a two-dimensional linked {As<sub>8</sub>V<sub>14</sub>} system [{Ln(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>}<sub>2</sub>As<sub>8</sub>V<sub>14</sub>O<sub>42</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>)]$_n$.8nH<sub>2</sub>O, that is derived from discrete {As<sub>8</sub>V<sub>14</sub>} cluster containing compound (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>[As<sub>8</sub>V<sub>14</sub>O<sub>42</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>)]. A polyoxometalate compound has been described in which a reduced tungstovanadate-heteropolyanion clusters get linked via capped V = O groups into one-dimensional chains. All these systems have already been reported elsewhere. The last portion of this article will be described by a new system [3-ampH]<sub>6</sub>[V<sub>10</sub>O<sub>28</sub>]$\cdot$2H<sub>2</sub>O having discrete molecular structure and extended supramolecular structure.</p>

				<title>Excited state charge transfer reaction in (mixed solvent + electrolyte) systems: Role of reactant-solvent and reactant-ion interactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0265-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescence spectroscopic techniques have been used to study the excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction of 4-(1-azetidinyl)benzonitrile (P4C) in two sets of mixed solvents, (1-propanol + ethyl acetate) and (propylene carbonate + acetonitrile), in the absence and presence of a strong electrolyte, lithium perchlorate. These two sets of mixed solvent systems represent binary solvent mixtures of low and high polarities, respectively. Density, sound velocity and viscosity measurements indicate that these two mixed solvent systems are structurally different. Stronger ion-reactant interaction is evidenced in the mole fraction independence of emission frequencies in electrolyte solutions of low polar binary solvent mixtures. For both these mixtures, the reaction driving force ($-\Delta G_r$) decreases with increase in mole fraction of the relatively less polar solvent component of the mixture. Interestingly, $-\Delta G_r$ increases significantly on addition of electrolyte in low polar mixtures and exhibits mixture composition dependence but, in contrast, $-\Delta G_r$ in high polar mixtures does not sense variation in mixture composition in presence of electrolyte. This insensitivity to mixture composition for high polar mixtures is also observed for the measured reaction time constant. In addition, the reaction time constant does not sense the presence of electrolyte in the high polar solvent mixtures. The reaction time constant in low polar mixtures, which becomes faster on addition of electrolyte, lengthens on increasing the mole fraction of the relatively less polar solvent component of the mixture. These observations have been qualitatively explained in terms of the measured solvent reorganization energy and reaction driving force by using expressions from the classical theory of electron transfer reaction.</p>

				<title>Biocatalysis of azidolysis of epoxides: Computational evidences on the role of halohydrin dehalogenase (HheC)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0279-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biocatalytic azidolysis of 9 unsymmetrical epoxides by halohydrin dehalogenase enzyme (HheC) in gas phase and uncatalysed azidolysis of the same epoxides in gas phase and in aqueous solution have been modelled at DFT level. Aliphatic epoxides (1-6) and aromatic epoxides (9) undergo ùõΩ cleavage while styrene oxide (7) and ùëù-nitro styrene (8) oxide prefer ùõº cleavage in the gas phase. Inclusion of aqueous solvation effect via Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) increases the activation barrier and makes the reaction endothermic due to extensive solvation of azide anion and oxido anionic products, but does not alter the regioselectivity. Halohydrin dehalogenase from Agrobacterium radiobactor <b><i>AD1</i></b> catalyses (E1-E9) ring opening of all these epoxides by azide ion with ùõΩ selectivity and the reversal of selectivity in epoxide 7 and 8 is notable. These reactions follow, in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic environment, S$_N$2 mechanism. Calculations while agreeing totally with experimental results offer better insights on the factors determining the regioselectivity and particularly the role of enzyme. Active site model and crystal structure data reveal that the Tyr145 and Ser132 form weak hydrogen bonds with epoxide oxygen lone pair and form reactant enzyme complex (REC). The enzyme complex activates the epoxide ring towards azidolysis. The NBO deletion and second order perturbation analyses clearly bring out the role of catalytic duo Tyr145 and Ser132 and particularly shed light on the dominant contribution of Tyr145 in selectively activating C$_{\beta}$-O bond. The present results indicate that Arg149 or other residues in the pocket do not seem to have any significant effect on the reaction.</p>

The integral cross sections obtained from the quasiclassical trajectory method are in good agreement with those of Chebyshev wave packet method for collision energies above 0.2 eV.We also investigated the vector correlations and polarized dependent differential cross sections (PDDCS) at different collision energies.

The minimum energy reaction path is found to involve the spin inversion in the different reaction steps. This potential energy curve-crossing dramatically affects reaction exothermic.

The reaction is a two-step process in which the first step is liganddependent, but the second step is ligand-independent and is assigned to ring closure. The rate and activation parameters, conductivity studies and IR data were used to deduce a plausible mechanism.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Six different ruthenium(III) complexes of Schiff bases derived from 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde and ùëú-aminophenol/ùëú-aminothiophenol have been synthesized. The compounds with the general formula [RuX(EPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)] (X = Cl or Br; E = P or As; L = bifunctional tridentate ONO/ONS donor Schiff base ligand) were characterized by infrared, electronic, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and elemental analyses. Spectroscopic investigation reveals coordination of Schiff base ligand through ONO/ONS donor atoms and octahedral geometry around ruthenium metal. Redox property of complexes has been examined by using cyclic voltammetry. The catalytic oxidation property of ruthenium(III) complexes were also investigated.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0343-0347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A self-supported 40W Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) system has been developed and performance tested. The auxiliaries in the DMFC system comprise a methanol sensor, a liquid-level indicator, and fuel and air pumps that consume a total power of about 5W. The system has a 15-cell DMFC stack with active electrode-area of 45 cm<sup>2</sup>. The self-supported DMFC system addresses issues related to water recovery from the cathode exhaust, and maintains a constant methanol-feed concentration with thermal management in the system. Pure methanol and water from cathode exhaust are pumped to the methanol-mixing tank where the liquid level is monitored and controlled with the help of a liquid-level indicator. During the operation, methanol concentration in the feed solution at the stack outlet is monitored using a methanol sensor, and pure methanol is added to restore the desired methanol concentration in the feed tank by adding the product water from the cathode exhaust. The feed-rate requirements of fuel and oxidant are designed for the stack capacity of 40W. The self-supported DMFC system is ideally suited for various defense and civil applications and, in particular, for charging the storage batteries.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report here the highly sensitive and selective electrochemical determination of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), one of the dopamine metabolites in the presence of important interferents ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) using an ultrathin electropolymerized film of 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol (p-ATT) modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode in 0.20M phosphate buffer solution (pH 5.0). The bare GC electrode fails to resolve the oxidation peaks of AA, DOPAC and UA in a mixture. Further, the oxidation peak potentials of them were shifted to more positive potential with decreased peak currents in the subsequent cycles. On the other hand, the p-ATT modified electrode not only separated the voltammetric signals of AA, DOPAC and UA but also enhanced their peak currents. The amperometric current response was increased linearly with increasing DOPAC concentration in the range of $4.0 \times 10^{‚àí8}$ to $1.0 \times 10^{‚àí5}$ M and the detection limit was found to be 150pM ($S/N =3$).</p>

				<title>Textural and morphological studies on zinc-iron alloy electrodeposits</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0357-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zinc-iron alloy electrodeposits have industrial significance, since they provide better corrosion resistance and with improved mechanical properties when compared to pure zinc coatings. This is due to the unique phase structure of the alloy formed. But this deposition belongs to anomalous deposition, where the electrochemically less noble zinc deposits more preferentially, than the more noble iron. So the industrial process control over the deposition becomes difficult. So, this study correlates the effect of various deposition parameters over the deposition kinetics and deposited alloy characteristics. Transition and partial current densities were computed. Effect of hydrogen overpotential and surface coverage due to the adsorbed intermediates over anomalous deposition were explored. Plausible deposition mechanism and mathematical model was proposed to predict the anomalous electrodeposition characteristics. Textural, morphological and phase structural characteristics of the alloy was investigated. By the substitution of iron in the hcp lattice, c/a ratio was lowered and the lattice geometry was distorted. Intermetallic compounds of variable composition such as FeZn<sub>14</sub>, Fe<sub>5</sub>Zn<sub>33</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>Zn<sub>13</sub> and FeZn<sub>3</sub> with `ùúÇ' and `ùõ§' phase structures were noted. Electrodeposition parameters were optimized and smooth, adherent, strain-free deposits with required iron content and hardness were obtained.</p>

				<title>Pyrene appended bile acid conjugates: Synthesis and a structure-gelation property study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0379-0391</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A wide variety of novel compounds obtained by combining two types of known organogelators, viz., bile acid alkyl amides and pyrene alkanoic acids, were synthesized and screened for their gelation ability. The 3ùõº esters of 1-pyrene butyric acid (PBA) of alkylamides of deoxycholic acid (DCA) turned out to be effective in the gel formation with many organic solvents although the gelation has to be triggered by the addition of a charge transfer (CT) agent 2,4,7-trinitrofluorenone (TNF). The special feature of these molecules is that the organogelation is achieved only after derivatizing the acid moiety of the 1-pyrenealkanoic acids. Additionally, the gelation properties can be fine-tuned by inserting different functional groups at the bile acid side chain. The gels obtained are deep red in colour and optically transparent up to 2&#37; w/v. The SEM studies of the obtained xerogels revealed bundled rod-like morphology without specialized branching.</p>

				<title>The role of weak intermolecular C-H‚Ä¶F interactions in supramolecular assembly: Structural investigations on 3,5- dibenzylidene-piperidin-4-one and database analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0403-0409</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fluorinated and non-fluorinated dibenzylidene-4-piperidones were synthesized and their structures examined using X-ray crystallography. Interestingly, the para-fluorosubstituted dibenzylidene compound, in contrast to other analogs, is characterized by C-H‚Ä¶F bonded one-dimensional packing motif. To evaluate the ability of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for forming interactions, in general and competitive situation, we have defined statistical descriptors. Analysis of Cambridge Structural Database using these newly defined parameters reveals high propensity of C-H‚Ä¶F interactions in organic crystals. The present structural study suggests much larger role of fluorine driven intermolecular interactions that are even though weak, but possess significant ability to direct and alter the packing.</p>

					<p>Cetyltrimethylammonium hypochlorite (CTAHC) is prepared and used as an oxidizing agent for nitroso group to nitro group. The <i>gem</i>-chloronitroso and <i>vic</i>-chloronitroso compounds are prepared respectively from ketoximes and olefins by reacting with NOCl generated <i>in situ</i> from chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) and <i>iso</i>-amyl nitrite. CTAHC oxidizes <i>gem</i>-chloronitroso and vic-chloronitroso compounds to the corresponding chloronitro derivatives. While <i>gem</i>-chloronitro compounds are obtained in good yields, the <i>vic</i>-chloronitro derivatives are formed in moderate yields, because of the propensity of the <i>vic</i>-chloronitroso group to tautomerize to ùõº-chlorooxime. The present method is simple and practical, particularly for the preparation of <i>vic</i>-chloronitro compounds, considering the fact that the known methods of their preparation are few and quite involved.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and efficient method has been developed for the synthesis of series of 4-aryl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2ùêª-indeno[1,2-ùëë]pyrimidine-2-thiones through Biginelli‚Äôs one-pot multicomponent condensation reaction via microwave irradiations. Then, these thiones were converted to their S-alkylated/aralkylated derivatives. The prepared heterocyclic products were structurally confirmed by analytical and spectral data and evaluated for their antibacterial activities. The results showed that this skeletal framework exhibited marked potency as antibacterial agents. The compound 2-(Ethylthio)-4-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1ùêª-indeno[1,2-ùëë]pyrimidines 4b have shown antibacterial activity towards all the seven clinical isolates used.</p>

					<p>Asymmetric alkyl substitution of various benzophenone Schiff base substrates under biphasic conditions proceeded using optically active Palladium(II) complexes. The corresponding products were obtained in high yields but with moderate enantiomeric excess (ee). Addition of specific ionic liquids to the reaction medium enhanced reactivity and selectivity for phase transfer catalytic (PTC) glycine alkylation. It has been found that there is an anionic influence of the ionic liquids that modify the steric environment around the enolate ion. A computer-assisted molecular design of enantioselective phase-transfer catalysis with the palladium complex and the ionic liquid has been done.</p>

				<title>Proximity effect on the general base catalysed hydrolysis of amide linkage: The role of cationic surfactant, CTABr</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>bis</i> phenoxide forms of (1,2)<i>bis</i>(2-hydroxybenzamido)ethane(<b>I</b>), (1,5)<i>bis</i>(2-hydroxybenzamido) 3-azapentane(<b>II</b>), (1,3)<i>bis</i>(2-hydroxybenzamido)propane(<b>III</b>), and (1,8)<i>bis</i>(2-hydroxybenzamido)3,6-diazaoctane(<b>IV</b>) undergo facile hydrolysis of one of the amide groups (0.02 &#8804; [OH<sup>‚àí</sup>]$_T$ (mol dm<sup>-3</sup>) &#8804; 0.5, 10&#37; MeOH (v/v) + H<sub>2</sub>O medium) without exhibiting [OH<sup>‚àí</sup>] dependence. The reactivity trend follows <b>I</b> &#8764; <b>II</b> &#62; &#62; <b>III</b> &#8764; <b>IV</b> with low activation enthalpy {$25.7\pm 2.8 &#8804;  \Delta H^{\neq}$(kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) $&#8804; 64.8\pm 7.0$}). The high negative and comparable values of activation entropy {$-234 \pm 8  &#8804; \Delta S^{\neq}$(J K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>) $&#8804;  ‚àí127 \pm  20$} are consistent with closely similar, and ordered transition states which can be assembled by favourably oriented phenoxide groups. The solvent kinetic isotope effect for <b>I</b>, $k^{H2O}/k^{D2O+H2O} \sim 1$ (20 and 50 volume&#37; D<sub>2</sub>O), indicates that proton transfer is not involved as a part of the rate controlling process. The observed slowing down of the rate of this reaction for I in the micellar pseudo phase of CTABr also supports the proposed mechanism. Under premicellar conditions, however, rate acceleration is observed, a consequence believed to be associated with the capping effect of the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant cation forming the reactive ion-pair, CTA<sup>+</sup>, (I-2H)<sup>2‚àí</sup> exclusively in the aqueous pseudo phase.</p>

				<title>Photocatalytic properties of KBiO3 and LiBiO3 with tunnel structures</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0517-0524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, KBiO<sub>3</sub> is synthesized by a standard oxidation technique while LiBiO<sub>3</sub> is prepared by hydrothermal method. The synthesized catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning ElectronMicroscopy (SEM), BET surface area analysis and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS). The XRD patterns suggest that KBiO<sub>3</sub> crystallizes in the cubic structure while LiBiO<sub>3</sub> crystallizes in orthorhombic structure and both of these adopt the tunnel structure. The SEM images reveal micron size polyhedral shaped KBiO<sub>3</sub> particles and rod-like or prismatic shape particles for LiBiO<sub>3</sub>. The band gap is calculated from the diffuse reflectance spectrum and is found to be 2.1 eV and 1.8 eV for KBiO<sub>3</sub> and LiBiO<sub>3</sub>, respectively. The band gap and the crystal structure data suggest that these materials can be used as photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of KBiO<sub>3</sub> and LiBiO<sub>3</sub> are evaluated for the degradation of anionic and cationic dyes, respectively, under UV and solar radiations.</p>

				<title>Photoprocesses of coordination compounds and dyes in solution and nanoporous materials: Evolution from milliseconds to femtoseconds</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0531-0553</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The photoredox reactions of cobalt(III), nickel(II) complexes and organic dyes are reviewed with particular emphasis on using flash photolysis methods to identify the transients in the time scale from milliseconds to subpicoseconds. The excitation flash radiation initially was limited to flash lamps with a time resolution to study the decay of the excited states and the fast reactions of photo produced transients in milliseconds and microseconds. Some of the photolysis reactions investigated provide details in real time including the thermal reactions of molecular oxygen with cobalt(II) amine systems and the cobalt (III) alkyl complex formation on photolysis of cobalt(III) aminoacid complexes. Photoredox reactions of thiazine and safranine dyes are investigated using time resolved absorption and emission techniques in solution and on encapsulation in micro and mesoporous host materials. Picosecond and femtosecond diffuse reflectance fluorescence investigations in the porous solid host materials show intramolecular proton transfer reactions of the dyes and deprotonation of the dyes in the excited states. Photosensitization of nanoparticles of semiconductors, anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO by the excited states of dyes in meso and microporous silicate hosts is investigated using pico and femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorptions techniques and the results are reviewed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new extended thermo-stable high molar extinction coefficient bipyridyl ruthenium(II) complex "<i>cis</i>-Ru(4,4'-<i>bis</i>(3,5-di-<i>tert</i>-butylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine)(<b>L</b>n)(NCS)<sub>2</sub> <b>H</b>101", where <b>L</b>n = 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine; was synthesized and characterized by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, FT-IR and ESI-MASS spectroscopes. The <b>H</b>101 sensitized solar cell constructed with an active area of 0.54 cm2 in combination with an ionic liquid electrolyte exhibited broader photocurrent action spectrum with solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (ùúÇ) of 5.89 (<b>J</b><sub><b>SC</b></sub> = 12.14 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, <b>V</b><sub><b>OC</b></sub> = 690 V, fill factor = 0.699) under Air Mass (AM) 1.5 sunlight, while the reference `<i>cis</i>-Ru(4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine)(<b>L</b>n)(NCS)<sub>2</sub>', <b>Z</b>907 sensitized solar cell exhibited ùúÇ-value of 5.17&#37; (<b>J</b><sub><b>SC</b></sub> = 11.93 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, <b>V</b><sub><b>OC</b></sub> = 650 V, fill factor = 0.666). TGA analysis of <b>H</b>101 showed extended thermal-stability and under continuous light exposure and aging at 55&#176;C, the DSSC retained 85&#37; of its initial ùúÇ-value, while under comparable conditions <b>Z</b>907 sensitized solar cell retained 88&#37;. As compared to 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine in <b>Z</b>907, the new ancillary bipyridyl ligand `4,4'-<i>bis</i>(3,5-di-<i>tert</i>-butylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine‚Äô in <b>H</b>101 shifts the absorption bands remarkably towards blue. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT excited state calculations of the new sensitizer show that the first three HOMOs have t2g character with sizeable mixing from the NCS ligands with ùúã-bonding orbitals of 4,4'-<i>bis</i>(3,5-di-<i>tert</i>-butylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine. The LUMO is a $\pi^\ast$-orbital localized on the 4,4-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine and higher un-occupied frontier orbitals have $\pi^\ast$-combinations with 4,4'-<i>bis</i>(3,5-di-<i>tert</i>-butylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0577-0592</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier and highest energy density fuel. Water gas shift (WGS) reaction is an important reaction to generate hydrogen from steam reforming of CO. A new WGS catalyst, Ce$_{1‚àíx}$Ru$_x$O$_{2‚àí\delta}$ ($0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.1$) was prepared by hydrothermal method using melamine as a complexing agent. The Catalyst does not require any pre-treatment. Among the several compositions prepared and tested, Ce<sub>0.95</sub>Ru<sub>0.05</sub>O$_{2‚àí\delta}$ (5&#37; Ru<sup>4+</sup> ion substituted in CeO<sub>2</sub>) showed very high WGS activity in terms of high conversion rate (20.5 ùúámol.g<sup>-1</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup> at 275&#176;C) and low activation energy (12.1 kcal/mol). Over 99&#37; conversion of CO to CO<sub>2</sub> by H<sub>2</sub>O is observed with 100&#37; H<sub>2</sub> selectivity at &#8805;  275&#176;C. In presence of externally fed CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> also, complete conversion of CO to CO<sub>2</sub> was observed with 100&#37; H<sub>2</sub> selectivity in the temperature range of 305-385&#176;C. Catalyst does not deactivate in long duration on/off WGS reaction cycle due to absence of surface carbon and carbonate formation and sintering of Ru. Due to highly acidic nature of Ru<sup>4+</sup> ion, surface carbonate formation is also inhibited. Sintering of noble metal (Ru) is avoided in this catalyst because Ru remains in Ru<sup>4+</sup> ionic state in the Ce$_{1‚àíx}$Ru$_x$O$_{2‚àí\delta}$ catalyst.</p>

					<p>The acid catalysed condensation of diketones with pyrrole did not result in the formation of expected divergent bisdipyrromethane always; instead the product depends on the chain length of the diketones, in particular the distance between the two carbonyl functional groups.When the two carbonyl groups are linked via one or two methylene groups, unusual ring annulation occurs resulting in the formation of various bridged bipyrroles. However, on further increase in the length of the spacer, between the two carbonyl groups, synthesis of the expected bisdipyrromethanes could be achieved.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A chemoselective Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction process of various aliphatic and allylic ùõº,ùõΩ-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones is described. This chemoselective reduction is catalysed by boron triisopropoxide B(O$^i$Pr)<sub>3</sub>. Kinetics of reduction of aldehydes and ketones to corresponding alcohols were also examined and rate constant of each carbonyl compounds were measured. Rate constant and reduction yield of each carbonyl compounds in the presence of B(O$^i$Pr)<sub>3</sub> were compared with those in the presence of B(OEt)<sub>3</sub>. The alcohols that are the reduction product were analysed by GC-MS. The rate constants and alcohol yields were found to be higher with B(OEt)<sub>3</sub> than with B(O$^i$Pr)<sub>3</sub>. The mechanism proposed involves a six-membered transition state in which both the alcohol and the carbonyl are coordinated to the same boron centre of a boron alkoxide catalyst.</p>

The computed geometric parameters are remarkably close to experimental values. DFT global chemical reactivity descriptors (chemical hardness, total energy, electronic chemical potential, and electrophilicity) are calculated for the isomers and used to predict their relative stability and reactivity.

				<title>Computational study on decomposition kinetics of CH<sub>3</sub>CFClO radical</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0733-0741</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study deals with the decomposition of haloalkoxy radical (CH<sub>3</sub>CFClO) formed from 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) in the atmosphere. The sudy is performed using <i>ab-initio</i> quantum mechanical methods. Out of the three plausible pathways of decomposition of the titled species, the one that involved the C-C bond scission and the other occurring via Cl-atom elimination have been considered for detailed study. The geometries of the reactant, products and transition states involved in the decomposition pathways are optimized and characterized at MP2 level of theory using 6-311G(d,p) basis set. Single point energy calculations have been performed at G2(MP2) level of theory. The path involving the Cl-elimination is found to be dominant and found to occur with a barrier height of 3.6 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> whereas the C-C bond scission path proceeds with a barrier of 10.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. The thermal rate constants for the above two decomposition pathways are evaluated using Canonical Transition State Theory (CTST) and these are found to be $2.9 \times 10^8 s^{‚àí1}$ and $4.3 \times  10^5 s^{‚àí1}$ for Cl-elimination and C-C bond scission respectively at 298 K and 1 atm. pressure. The existence of transition states on the corresponding potential energy surface is ascertained by the occurrence of only one imaginary frequency obtained during the frequency calculation. The Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculation has also been performed to confirm the smooth connection of the TS to the reactant and the products.</p>

				<title>A density functional study on the adsorption of hydrogen molecule onto small copper clusters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0743-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An all-electron scalar relativistic calculation on the adsorption of hydrogen molecule onto small copper clusters has been performed by using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) at PW91 level. Our results reveal that after adsorption of H<sub>2</sub> molecule, the Cu-Cu interaction is strengthened and the H-H interaction is weakened, the reactivity enhancement of H<sub>2</sub> molecule is obvious. The VIPs, HLGs and VEAs of Cu$_n$H<sub>2</sub> clusters show an obvious odd-even oscillation. It is suggested that the H<sub>2</sub> molecule is more favourable to be adsorbed by the even-numbered small copper clusters. Meanwhile, the odd-even alteration of magnetic moments is also observed and may be served as the material with tunable code capacity of `0‚Äô and `1' by adsorbing hydrogen molecule onto odd or even-numbered small copper clusters. Some discrepancies of dissociative adsorption between our work and previous works are found and may be understood in terms of the electron pairing effect and the scalar relativistic effect.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>To better understand how and to what extent the halosubstituted carbene radical anions effect the chlorine abstraction of CHCl<sub>3</sub>, a detailed theoretical investigation has been performed at the UMP2/6-311++G (d, p)/RECP level of theory. The model system CHCl<sub>3</sub>+CHX<sup>¬∑‚àí</sup>/CX$^{¬∑‚àí}_2$ (X = Cl, Br, and I) has been chosen for the present study. According to the detailed discussions of geometries and energetics of the optimized stationary points, our theoretical findings suggest that the Cl-abstraction reactions by CHX<sup>¬∑‚àí</sup> are energetically favourable, indicating the less massive substitution X in CHX<sup>¬∑‚àí</sup> the easier abstraction reaction, as compared to those by CX$^{¬∑‚àí}_2$, which are energetically unfavourable and would be endothermic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Metal selective co-ordinative nanostructures were constructed by the supramolecular co-assembly of pyridine appended TTF (<b>TTF-Py</b>) and pyrene (<b>PYR-Py</b>) derivatives in appropriate solvent composition mixtures with metal ions.Microscopic analyses show that <b>TTF-Py</b> shows distinctive morphology with either of these metal ions, forming I-D tapes with 1:1 Pb<sup>2+</sup> complex and 2-D sheets with 1:2 Zn<sup>2+</sup> complex. A rationale has been provided from molecular level packing for such hierarchical changes. In case of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, we have observed an anomalous binding of metal ion to the core sulphur groups causing redox changes in the TTF core. <b>PYR-Py</b> on the other hand is shown to be a fluorescent sensor for Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Hg<sup>2+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</sup>. With different fluorescent response for metal complexes, we essentially obtained similar 1-D assemblies suggesting similar binding modes for all of them. Supramolecular approach through which morphology of an electron donor moiety can be engineered by metal ions can be a new tool in nanoelectronics.</p>

					<p>In this paper, the synthesis and characterization of some imidazole-based gold-selenolates are described. This study indicates that the nature of selenolate plays an important role in ligand exchange reactions in gold(I) selenolates. Furthermore, the reactivity of imidazole-based gold(I) selenolates toward nucleophiles such as selenols and phosphines is strikingly different from that of the $N,N$-dimethylaminobenzylamine-based gold(I) complexes. The presence of Se$\cdots$N non-bonded interactions in $N,N$-dimethylaminobenzylamine-based gold(I) complexes modulates the reactivity of Au(I) centre towards incoming nucleophiles.</p>

				<title>Axial phenoxide coordination on di-iron(III) bisporphyrin: Insights from experimental and DFT studies</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0827-0837</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, structure and properties of new five-coordinate phenolate complexes of di-iron(III) bisporphyrin are reported here, in which phenol binds in $\eta^1$-fashion as an axial ligand. The solid and solution EPR at 120K and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectral pattern in solution provide unequivocal evidence for the high spin (S = 5/2) nature of the complex. Mulliken spin density calculation using DFT demonstrates the positive spin densities at the <i>meso</i> carbons and negative spin densities at the methylene carbons and, as a result, the <i>meso</i> and methylene protons are shifted in the upfield and down field regions, respectively in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the molecule. Also, the <i>ortho</i>- and <i>para</i>-protons of the phenolate ligands are observed to be shifted in the upfield region while <i>meta</i>-protons are shifted downfield. The alternating shift pattern, which is the opposite sign of the chemical shifts for <i>meta</i>-versus <i>ortho</i>- and <i>para</i>-protons, was also explained due to negative and positive spin densities, respectively on the carbons and indicative of ùúã spin delocalization on the phenolate ligand. Thus, the calculated spin density maps accounted for the essential <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopic features that are observed here for the phenolate complexes of di-iron(III) bisporphyrin. The temperature dependence of the signals follows the Curie law which is indicative of single spin state throughout the temperature range of ‚àí40 to +40&#176;C. The single crystal X-ray structure of the corresponding chloro derivative, <i>trans</i> 1,2-<i>bis</i>(chloroiron(III) octaethyl porphyrinyl)ethene, has also been reported here which authenticates the high-spin nature of the complex.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis of novel cyclobutadiene linked dimers of [$\eta^5$-RCp]Co($\eta^4$-C<sub>4</sub>Ph<sub>4</sub>) was reported recently from a three-component reaction of 1,4-diphenylbutadiyne, diphenylacetylene and [$\eta^5$-RCp]Co(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> [R = H or MeOC(O)]. The chiral <i>bis</i> oxazoline derivative of this dimer was found to form cobalt oxazolinyl palladacycles which were excellent chiral catalysts for the Overman-Claisen rearrangement of trichloroacetimidates, similar to the well-known COP catalysts. In this paper, we report reactions carried out for identifying the intermediates in the formation of the dimeric sandwich compound {[$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co($\eta^4$-C<sub>4</sub>Ph<sub>3</sub>)}<sub>2</sub> (<b>1</b>). On varying the stoichiometric ratio of the reactants of the three component reaction, two new cobalt sandwich compounds [$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co[$\eta^4$-C<sub>4</sub>Ph<sub>3</sub>(C‚â°CPh)] (<b>2</b>) and [$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co[$\eta^4$-C<sub>4</sub>-Ph<sub>2</sub>(C‚â°CPh)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>3</b>) were found to form as viscous oily liquids. The identity of <b>2</b> was ascertained by oxidizing its alkyne moiety to yield crystalline [$\eta^5$-MeOC(O)Cp]Co{$\eta^4$-C<sub>4</sub>Ph<sub>3</sub>[C(O)-C(O)Ph]} (<b>4</b>) which was structurally characterized. Further, the role of phenylethynyl derived monomeric sandwich compound <b>2</b> as a precursor to the dimeric compound <b>1</b> was established by reacting <b>2</b> with diphenylacetylene and CpCo(COD) which yielded the first example of an unsymmetrical cyclobutadiene linked dimeric cobalt sandwich compound {$\eta^5$-[MeOC(O)Cp]Co($\eta^4$-C<sub>4</sub>Ph<sub>3</sub>)}[($\eta^5$-Cp)Co($\eta^4$-C<sub>4</sub>Ph<sub>3</sub>)] (<b>5</b>) which was also structurally characterized.</p>

				<title>$\pi u$-Stacking interactions between G-quartets and circulenes: A computational study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0891-0900</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Structures of planar and bowl-shaped circulenes as well as their stacks with G-quartet (G4) have been investigated through dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT-D). The binding energies are substantial $\tilde ‚àº$10 kcal/mol with d ‚àº3.5 &#197; between the stacking rings. The calculations show that G4 binds much more effectively to planar circulenes as compared to bowl shaped molecules. The strength of binding between a G-quartet and a non-planar circulene molecule depends on the orientation of the circulene (concave or convex) with respect to G-quartet. An AIM analysis of the M05-2X wave-functions has also been performed to confirm the presence of weak intermolecular interactions between guanine quartets and circulenes. Apart from ùúã-stacking interactions, the concave bowl-shaped circulenes also interact with G4 through C-H$\cdots \pi$ interactions. The charge transport properties between the two moieties have also been analysed through effective transport integral. The calculations provide an understanding for the basis of molecular recognition by G4 for non-planar systems.</p>

				<title>Silica nanodisks as platforms for fluorescence lifetime-based sensing of pH</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0901-0907</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Core-shell conjugates of silica nanodisks and fluorescent dyes have been prepared. Rhodamine B, the reference, has been attached to the core, by surface functionalization of the pristine SNDs. Then, a layer of silica has been deposited on the composite nanodisks. Finally, the surface has been functionalized with fluorescein in one case and protoporphyrin IX in the other. These dyes exhibit pH-dependent fluorescence properties. The nanoconjugates are found to sense the pH of the medium, through systematic variation of the fluorescence intensity ratios of the reporter dye at the surface and the reference dye at the core. Moreover, the fluorescence lifetimes and corresponding amplitudes of the reporter dyes have been found to be reliable parameters for assessing the pH of the medium, even though the variation in lifetimes of fluorescein is rather small. In case of protoporphyrin, however, this variation is significantly large. Besides, the change in amplitudes is prominent in acidic as well as alkaline solutions. The temporal parameters can thus be used to ascertain the pH of the medium, when used in conjunction with each other.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An enhancement in the excited state proton transfer (ESPT) processes of coumarin-102 (C-102) dye was observed upon addition of salicylic acid and hydrochloric acid in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micellar solution. The phenomenon was observed only in the micellar medium of anionic surfactant SDS and not in case of cationic (CTAB) or neutral (Trition X -100) surfactants. ESPT of C-102 was also observed in aqueous solutions but on addition of very high concentrations of hydrochloric acid. However, on comparing the ratio of the protonated species from the emission spectra in the presence and absence of SDS micelle, a conclusive estimation of the local proton concentration at the Stern layer of SDS micelles could be evaluated.</p>

				<page>0919-0926</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Peripheral functionalization of PAMAM dendrimers with naphthalene units leads to significant ground state aggregation in the system above the critical aggregation concentrations (CAC). Upon photoexcitation of the ground state aggregates, static type excimer formation of naphthalene moiety is observed. Significant red-shifted emission from naphthalene excimers is achieved through generating the static type excimers in polar solvents such as methanol and acetonitrile-water mixtures. Control experiments suggest that the presence of dendritic scaffold in the system play a pivotal role in generating intense static excimer emission in naphthalene modified PAMAM dendrimers, in solution phase at room temperature.</p>

				<title>Comparative self-assembly studies and self-sorting of two structurally isomeric naphthalene-diimide (NDI)-gelators</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0963-0973</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have reported here a comparative self-assembly and gelation studies of two isomeric bis-amide functionalized NDI-derivatives. In one case (<b>NDI-1</b>) the two amide groups were placed symmetrically on either side of the chromophore while for the other system (<b>NDI-2</b>) they were located on same side. In non-polar solvent both isomers formed self-assembled structures by synergistic effect of ùúã-stacking and hydrogen-bonding. The propensity for self-assembly of <b>NDI-1</b> was greater due to symmetrical placement of two amide groups on either arms of this chromophore which allowed ùúã-stacking in tandem with hydrogen-bonding, while <b>NDI-2</b> formed thermally more stable self-assembled fibres possibly due to location of two amide groups in close proximity along single arm of this chromophore. The structural difference in these two isomers lead to distinctly different morphology of their respective self-assembled structures which was further reflected on their gelation properties. Morphology of the self-assembled array of <b>NDI-1</b> showed organized and regular entangled bundles of nanorods which imparted better gelation ability to this chromophore while the self-assembled fibres of <b>NDI-2</b> showed less ordered and irregular fibres. We also probed self- assembly of these two chromophores in their mixture which revealed orthogonal assembly of the individual chromophores and no molecular mixing was noticed.</p>

					<p>The quantum dynamics of intramolecular H-atom transfer in malonaldehyde is investigated with a model two-dimensional Hamiltonian constructed with the help of available <i>ab initio</i> theoretical data on the relevant portion of the potential energy surface. At zero temperature, the H-atom transfer takes place by tunnelling leading to <i>cis-cis</i> isomerization while the <i>cis-trans</i> channel remains closed. Local excitation of the <i>cis-trans</i> mode by an external field is predicted to quench <i>cis-cis</i> tunnelling isomerization while excitation of the <i>cis-cis</i> mode is found to enhance the isomerization by tunnelling.</p>

					<p>By employing an intense microwave laser of wavelength 116.65 ùúám with intensities $1 \times 10^{13}$ and $5 \times  10^{18}$Wcm<sup>‚àí2</sup>, respectively, the conclusion is reached theoretically and computationally that it is possible to dissociate the CO molecule, modelled as a Morse oscillator. It is predicted that for above-threshold dissociation (ATD), the molecule should absorb 1044 photons of the given wavelength in order to reach the lowest edge of the vibrational continuum. A consistent analysis of the predicted dissociation process is provided though the time-dependent probability density, dissociation probability, norm, potential function, HHG and ATD spectra, obtained by numerically solving the time-dependent vibrational Sch√∂dinger equation.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0051-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed a nuclear dynamics simulation to calculate photoelectron spectra and population profiles of benzene radical cation (C<sub>6</sub>H$^+_6$) employing the parallelized Time Dependent Discrete Variable Representation (TDDVR) approach. For this purpose, we have considered <i>two</i> multi-state multi-mode model Hamiltonians of C<sub>6</sub>H$^+_6$ with degeneracy among the electronic states: (a) One consists of three states and eight modes, which in turn leads to a <i>five state thirteen mode Hamiltonian</i> ($X^2$E$_{1g}$-$B^2$E$_{2g}$-$C^2$A$_{2u}$) due to the degeneracy; and (b) The other is constituted of three states and thirteen modes which is basically a <i>five state twenty mode Hamiltonian</i> ($B^2$E$_{2g}$-$D^2$E$_{1u}$-$E^2$B$_{2u}$) for the same reason. Since these electronic states are interconnected by several conical intersections in the vicinity of the Franck Condon region, it will be <i>challenging</i> to pursue such large dynamical calculation in the presence of nonadiabaticity among the electronic states. The spectral as well as population profiles calculated with the advent of TDDVR approach show reasonably good agreement with the results obtained by the Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) methodology.</p>

				<title>Understanding proton affinity of tyrosine sidechain in hydrophobic confinement</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0059-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tyrosine is an important amino acid residue that plays a key role in several biochemical transformations such as, abstraction/donation of proton from/by its sidechain. We present here a density functional study on the proton affinity of tyrosine sidechain suspended inside the core of a single walled carbon nanotube that mimics the environment of protein structural pores and molecular channels. Tyrosine is found to exhibit a lower reactivity on confinement and unlike several other polar amino acid sidechains, its reactivity does not respond to hydrogen bonding with neighbouring hydroxyl groups.</p>

					<p>Exact wave packet calculations are carried out to investigate the effect of vibrational excitation of the reagent bonds on the dynamics of the CN + H<sub>2</sub> ‚Üí HCN + H process using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree algorithm. The results are compared to the approximate theoretical and the available experimental results.

				<title>Dynamics of atomic clusters in intense optical fields of ultrashort duration</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0075-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intense laser pulses have been generated that last for only 10 fs, long enough to accommodate only 3 optical cycles of 800 nm light. Upon focussing such pulses, intensities in the 10<sup>15</sup> W cm<sup>‚àí2</sup> range are readily generated. At such intensities, the magnitude of the optical field begins to match intra-atomic Coulombic fields. Consequently, exposure of atoms and molecules to such intense pulses inevitably leads to single and multiple ionization. We report here results of experiments that we have conducted that involve irradiation of gas-phase Ar15,000 clusters by such intense, few-cycle laser pulses. The clusters become multiply ionized and undergo Coulomb explosion, giving rise to ejection of fast Ar-ions. Results show that the strong-field dynamics in the few-cycle domain differ significantly from those that occur in the longer pulse (&#62; 30 fs) regime. Manifestations of these differences are presented in the form of angle-dependent ion energy and ion yield functions.</p>

				<page>0083-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein folding, considered to be the holy grail of molecular biology, remains intractable even after six decades since the report of the first crystal structure. Over 70,000 X-ray and NMR structures are now available in protein structural repositories and no physico-chemical solution is in sight. Molecular simulation methodologies have evolved to a stage to provide a computational solution to the tertiary structures of small proteins. Knowledge base driven methodologies are maturing in predicting the tertiary structures of query sequences which share high similarities with sequences of known structures in the databases. The void region thus seems to be medium (&#62; 100 amino acid residues) to large proteins with no sequence homologs in the databases and hence which has become a fertile ground for the genesis of hybrid models which exploit local similarities together with <i>ab initio</i> models to arrive at reasonable predictions.We describe here the development of <i>Bhageerath</i> an <i>ab initio</i> model and <i>Bhageerath</i>-H a hybrid model and present a critique on the current status of prediction of protein tertiary structures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Pericyclic reactions in the electronic ground state may be initiated by down-chirped pump-dump sub-pulses of an optimal laser pulse, in the ultraviolet (UV) frequency and sub-10 femtosecond (fs) time domain. This is demonstrated by means of a quantum dynamics model simulation of the Cope rearrangement of Semibullvalene. The laser pulse is designed by means of optimal control theory, with detailed analysis of the mechanism. The theoretical results support the recent experimental initiation of a pericyclic reaction. The present approach provides an important step towards monitoring asynchronous electronic fluxes during synchronous nuclear pericyclic reaction dynamics, with femto-to-attosecond time resolution, as motivated by the recent prediction of our group.</p>

					<p>Laser-induced fluorescence spectra of a 2:1 complex between 7-azaindole and water, known as `non-reactive dimer‚Äô of the molecule, have been measured in a supersonic jet expansion. The dispersed fluorescence spectrum of the electronic origin band of the complex shows a very large number of low-frequency vibrational features corresponding to different intermolecular modes of the complex in the ground electronic state. Geometries of several possible isomeric structures of the complex and their vibrational frequencies at harmonic approximation were calculated by electronic structure theory method at MP2/6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> level. An excellent agreement is observed between the measured and calculated intermolecular vibrational mode frequencies for the energetically most favoured structure of the complex, where the water molecule is inserted within one of the two N$\cdots$H-N hydrogen bonds of the 7AI dimer.</p>

				<title>Tailoring approach for obtaining molecular orbitals of large systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0149-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular orbitals (MO‚Äôs) within Hartree-Fock (HF) theory are of vital importance as they provide preliminary information of bonding and features such as electron localization and chemical reactivity. The contemporary literature treats the Kohn-Sham orbitals within density functional theory (DFT) equivalently to the MO's obtained within HF framework. The high scaling order of <i>ab initio</i> methods is the main hurdle in obtaining the MO's for large molecular systems. With this view, an attempt is made in the present work to employ molecular tailoring approach (MTA) for obtaining the complete set of MO's including occupied and virtual orbitals, for large molecules at HF and B3LYP levels of theory. The energies of highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, and hence the band gaps, are accurately estimated by MTA for most of the test cases benchmarked in this study, which include ùúã-conjugated molecules. Typically, the root mean square errors of valence MO's are in range of 0.001 to 0.010 a.u. for all the test cases examined. MTA shows a time advantage factor of 2 to 3 over the corresponding actual calculation, for many of the systems reported.</p>

				<title>Evidence for the powerful catalytic ability of imidozirconocene complex from its epoxide ring cleavage reactions - A DFT mechanistic view</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0167-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Imidozirconocene complex is known for its bifunctional reactivity and catalytic ability and this complex mediates ring cleavage of epoxides. Cyclooctene oxide (<b>1</b>) Norbornene oxide (<b>2</b>) and 2,5-dimethyl cyclohexene oxide (<b>3</b>) undergo ring cleavage in the presence of imidozirconocene complex. Epoxide <b>1</b> has accessible ùõΩ-hydrogens (type I) while epoxide <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> do not have them (type II). Normally type I epoxides undergo elimination while type II epoxides prefer insertion. All the insertion reactions lead to five-membered metallacycle formation and elimination results in thermodynamically stable allyl-alkoxy product. The insertion is a two-step process following either diradical or zwitterionic pathway, while elimination is a one-step concerted reaction. DFT (density functional theory) modelling of these reactions at B3LYP/LANL2DZ level show that epoxide <b>1</b> undergoes elimination in agreement with experiment. However, calculations indicate that epoxide (<b>2</b>) proceeds through diradical intermediate in contrast to experimental observations. Surprisingly, epoxide (<b>3</b>) that has both the ùõΩ positions blocked by methyl groups undergoes elimination rather than insertion. AIM and EDA analyses offer further insights on the reaction mechanism and bifunctional reactivity of imidozirconozene complex.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>When a light beam passes through any medium, the effects of interaction of light with the material depend on the field intensity. At low light intensities the response of materials remain linear to the amplitude of the applied electromagnetic field. But for sufficiently high intensities, the optical properties of materials are no longer linear to the amplitude of applied electromagnetic field. In such cases, the interaction of light waves with matter can result in the generation of new frequencies due to nonlinear processes such as higher harmonic generation and mixing of incident fields. One such nonlinear process, namely, the third order nonlinear spectroscopy has become a popular tool to study molecular structure. Thus, the spectroscopy based on the third order optical nonlinearity called stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS) is a tool to extract the structural and dynamical information about a molecular system. Ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopy (URLS) is analogous to SRS but is more sensitive than SRS. In this paper, we present the theoretical basis of SRS (URLS) techniques which have been developed in our laboratory.</p>

				<title>Hydrogenoid orbitals revisited: From Slater orbitals to Coulomb Sturmians</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0187-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The simple connection between the Slater orbitals, venerable in quantum chemistry, and the Coulomb Sturmian orbitals, more recently employed in atomic and molecular physics, is pointed out explicitly in view of the renewed interest in both as basis sets in applied quantum mechanics. Research in Slater orbitals mainly concerns multicentre, many-body integrals, whereas that on Sturmians exploits their orthonormality and completeness with no need of continuum states. An account of recent progress is outlined, also with reference to relationships between the two basis sets, and with the momentum space and hyperspherical harmonics representations.</p>

				<title>The role of C-H$\ldots \pi$ interaction in the stabilization of benzene and adamantane clusters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0193-0202</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this investigation, a systematic attempt has been made to understand the interaction between adamantane and benzene using both ab initio and density functional theory methods. C-H$\ldots \pi$ type of interaction between C-H groups of adamantane and ùúã cloud of benzene is found as the important attraction for complex formation. The study also reveals that the methylene (-CH<sub>2</sub>) and methine (-CH) groups of adamantane interact with benzene resulting in different geometrical structures. And it is found that the former complex is stronger than the later. The diamondoid structure of adamantane enables it to interact with a maximum of four benzene molecules, each one along the four faces. The stability of the complex increases with increase in the number of benzene molecules. The energy decomposition analysis of adamantane-benzene complexes using DMA approach shows that the origin of the stability primarily arises from the dispersive interaction. The theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) supports the existence of weak interaction between the two systems. The electrostatic topography features provide clues for the mode of interaction of adamantane with benzene.</p>

				<title>Density functional studies of endosulphan and its interaction with glycine and GABA</title>

				<page>0203-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theoretic (DFT) methods are employed to study the interactions between endosulphan and two amino acids, namely glycine and ùõæ -aminobutyric acid (GABA). Two conformers of each isomer ùõº- and ùõΩ-endosulphan are considered in the study. The DFT methods B3LYP, M05, M05-2X, M06 and M06-2X in conjunction with the basis set 6-31++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> are used. The complexes of ùõº- and ùõΩ-endosulphan with amino acids are stabilized by a strong hydrogen bond. In addition, there are several weak C-H‚Ä¶O interactions present between the two moieties. Among the DFT methods used, M06-2X method shows the highest stabilization energy for all the complexes. The M06-2X/6-31++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> method predicts that among the four conformers of endosulphan, the ùõº conformer in which the S=O points up, forms the most stable complex with both glycine and GABA, with stabilization energies ‚àí15.24 kcal/mol and ‚àí14.39 kcal/mol, respectively. The ùõΩ conformer in which the S=O points down, forms the least stable complex with both amino acids with stabilization energies ‚àí7.14 and ‚àí7.85 kcal/mol, respectively.</p>

				<title>Variation of kinetic isotope effect in multiple proton transfer reactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0209-0214</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recently, we had suggested that the motion along the promoter mode in the first part of the IRC of proton transfer reaction enhances the delocalization of $n_\sigma$ electrons on the acceptor atom into the $\sigma^\ast$ orbital of the donor-hydrogen covalent bond, and as a consequence weakens it. This leads to a reduction of the barrier to the proton transfer as well as the stretching frequency of donor-hydrogen bond. An extension of this to the concerted multiple proton transfer reactions implies that the kinetic isotope effect in such reaction depends exponentially on the number of protons that are being transferred. Computational evidence on three systems, (HF)<sub>3</sub>, formic acid dimer, and (H<sub>2</sub>O)$_n$ clusters is provided to support this assertion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present an <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics study of vibrational spectral diffusion and hydrogen bond dynamics in aqueous solution of acetone at room temperature. It is found that the frequencies of OD bonds in the acetone hydration shell have a higher stretch frequency than those in the bulk water. Also, on average, the frequencies of hydration shell OD modes are found to increase with increase in the acetone-water hydrogen bond distance. The vibrational spectral diffusion of the hydration shell water molecules reveals three time scales: A short-time relaxation (‚àº80 fs) corresponding to the dynamics of intact acetone-water hydrogen bonds, a slower relaxation (‚àº1.3 ps) corresponding to the lifetime of acetone-water hydrogen bonds and another longer time constant (‚àº12 ps) corresponding to the escape dynamics of water from the solute hydration shell. The present first principles results are compared with those of available experiments and classical simulations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Dipole moment calculations of SF and ClO radicals have been carried out using the recently developed partial triples correction to Fock-space multi-reference coupled cluster method. Theoretical calculation of the doublet SF and ClO radicals is useful due to their importance in atmospheric chemistry. The dipole moments of these radicals are extremely sensitive to correlation effects. A brief insight to the way the triples correction has been implemented is presented. We compare the results obtained from our analytic response treatment with that of restricted open Hartree-Fock (ROHF) calculations. Results are presented for both relaxed and non-relaxed approach in the ROHF method. Results suggest the importance of triples corrections. The effects of orbital relaxation are also analysed from the results.</p>

				<title>Excitation energy transfer from dye molecules to doped graphene</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0233-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recently, we have reported theoretical studies on the rate of energy transfer from an electronically excited molecule to graphene. It was found that graphene is a very efficient quencher of the electronically excited states and that the rate $\alpha z^{‚àí4}$. The process was found to be effective up to 30 $nm$ which is well beyond the traditional FRET limit. In this report, we study the transfer of an amount of energy $\hbar \Omega$ from a dye molecule to doped graphene. We find a crossover of the distance dependence of the rate from $z^{‚àí4}$ to exponential as the Fermi level is increasingly shifted into the conduction band, with the crossover occurring at a shift of the Fermi level by an amount $\hbar \Omega/2$.</p>

					<p>Using dimensional analyses, the scaling properties of the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship as well as the various information theoretical uncertainty-like relationships are derived for the bound states corresponding to the superposition of the power potential of the form $V(r) = Zr^n + \sum_i Z_ir^{n_i}$, where ùëç, $Zi$, ùëõ, $n_i$ are parameters, in the free state as well as in the additional presence of a spherical penetrable boundary wall located at radius ùëÖ The uncertainty product and all other net information measures are shown here to depend only on the parameters [$s_i$] defined by the ratios $Z_i/Z^{(n_i+2)/(n+2)}$. Introduction of a finite potential, $V_c$ at the radial distance $r &#8805; R$ results in a complete set of scaling parameters given by [$s_i$, $t_1$, $t_2$], where $t_1$ is given by $RZ^{1/(n+2)}$ and $t_2 = V_c/(Z)^{2/(n+2)}$.</p>

				<page>0247-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The first three photoelectron bands of 2-phenylethyl-$N,N$-dimethylamine (PENNA) are investigated theoretically, paying particular attention to the vibrational structure and to possible nonadiabatic coupling effects. A substantial vibronic interaction is established between the first and second excited cationic states (corresponding to the second and third photoelectron bands). Their coupling to the cationic ground state is found to be rather weak. This is tentatively attributed to the well-known fact that the latter carries a hole at the amine site, while the former two have the electron removed from benzene-type orbitals. The interaction between the two excited cationic states is characterized by a `hidden‚Äô or local symmetry at the phenyl moiety. Preliminary dynamic calculations with two interacting electronic states and four vibrational modes are reported. The computed spectra are compared to experimental results of Weinkauf <i>et al</i>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Theoretical studies on hydrogen adsorption properties of silicon-lithium binary clusters are carried out. We have considered three different clusters viz., Si<sub>5</sub>Li$^{‚àí5}$, Si<sub>5</sub>Li<sup>6</sup> and Si<sub>5</sub>Li$^+_7$ and for each cluster, the geometries of different possible isomers are optimized. In all the minimum energy isomers of the three clusters considered, two of the lithium atoms are found to be situated in the axial positions and the remaining lithium atoms are in the equatorial position in the Si<sub>5</sub> plane. The lithium atoms which are in Si<sub>5</sub> plane are bonded to the Si-Si edge through a bridged bond instead of a corner in the Si5 ring. From the calculated atomic charges, it is found that there is a charge transfer from lithium to silicon leaving a partial positive charge on the Li atoms and the axial lithium atoms are more charged as compared to the remaining lithium atoms. In the case of Si<sub>5</sub>Li<sub>6</sub> and Si<sub>5</sub>Li$^+_7$, the Li sites can trap a total of 14 and 17 H<sub>2</sub> molecules, respectively, with each bridge bonded Li site adsorbing three H<sub>2</sub> molecules and each axial Li adsorbing one H<sub>2</sub> molecule which corresponds to a gravimetric density of 13.33 wt&#37; and 15.25 wt&#37;, respectively.</p>

				<title>Structure and transport properties of LiF-BeF<sub>2</sub> mixtures: Comparison of rigid and polarizable ion potentials</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0261-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the structure and dynamics of the LiF-BeF<sub>2</sub> system over a range of compositions using the transferable rigid-ion model (TRIM). The densities obtained with the TRIM potential are approximately 17-20&#37; lower than the experimental values while polarizable ion models (PIM) give densities within 5&#37; of the experimental value. The TRIM and PIM potentials give essentially identical radial distribution functions (RDFs) for Li-F and Be-F ion pairs though the Be-Be pair correlations differ significantly and reflect the corresponding density differences. The variation in the radial distribution functions with concentration, particularly the anion-anion pair correlation function, reflects the reorganization of the fluoride ions as the addition of BeF<sub>2</sub> in the mixture promotes the formation of the tetrahedral fluoroberyllate network. Along the 67 mol&#37; LiF isopleth, diffusivities and Nernst-Einstein ionic conductivities from simulations using the PIM and TRIM potentials are in good agreement for temperatures up to 925 K. The viscosity data using the PIM model is also found to be in good agreement with the TRIM results presented here along the 873K isotherm for compositions ranging from 0 to 50 mol&#37; BeF<sub>2</sub>. The main conclusion from this study is that the non-polarizable, TRIM provides reasonable results for the structural correlations and transport properties of the LiF-BeF<sub>2</sub> system in comparison with first-principles-based, PIM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two-photon microscopy depends extensively on the two-photon absorption cross-sections of biologically relevant chromophores. High repetition rate (HRR) lasers are essential in multiphoton microscopy for generating satisfactory signal to noise at low average powers. However, HRR lasers generate thermal distortions in samples even with the slightest single photon absorption. We use an optical chopper with HRR lasers to intermittently `blank‚Äô irradiation and effectively minimize thermal effects to result in a femtosecond z-scan setup that precisely measures the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections of chromophores. Though several experimental factors impact such TPA measurements, a systematic effort to modulate and influence TPA characteristics is yet to evolve. Here, we present the effect of several control parameters on the TPA process that are independent of chromophore characteristics for femtosecond laser pulse based measurements; and demonstrate how the femtosecond laser pulse repetition rate, chromophore environment and incident laser polarization can become effective control parameters for such nonlinear optical properties.</p>

				<title>On the nature of highly vibrationally excited states of thiophosgene</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0291-0300</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work an analysis of the highly vibrationally excited states of thiophosgene (SCCl<sub>2</sub>) is made in order to gain insights into some of the experimental observations and spectral features. The states analysed here lie in a spectrally complex region where strong mode mixings are expected due to the overlap of several strong anharmonic Fermi resonances. Two recent techniques, a semiclassical angle space representation of the eigenstates and the parametric variation of the eigenvalues (level-velocities) are used to identify eigenstate sequences exhibiting common localization characteristics. Preliminary results on the influence of highly excited out-of-plane bending modes on the nature of the eigenstates suggest a possible bifurcation in the system.</p>

				<title>Adsorption of croconate dyes on TiO<sub>2</sub> anatase (101) surface: A periodic DFT study to understand the binding of diketo groups</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0301-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The adsorption of model croconate dyes on the stoichiometric TiO<sub>2</sub> anatase (101) surface has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations to understand the adsorption of the diketo (-COCO-) groups. Past experimental and theoretical results have shown the strong binding ability of the acid group (-COOH) to the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface but here the theoretical studies predicts the binding strength of the diketo group to be also significant and comparable with that of the -COOH group. This may cause a competitive binding between the keto groups and the acid groups on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface in the case of croconate dyes and cause a reduction in the efficiency of the DSSC.</p>

				<title>Quantum dynamics of the Cl+H<sub>2</sub> reaction at ultracold temperatures</title>

				<page>0311-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantum calculations are reported for the reaction between vibrationally excited H<sub>2</sub> molecules and Cl atoms at energies ranging from the ultracold to thermal regimes. It is found that chemical reaction leading to vibrationally excited HCl molecules dominates over non-reactive vibrational quenching. The product HCl molecule is found to be formed predominantly in the $v = 1$ vibrational level with appreciable rotational excitation. A spin-orbit uncorrected value of $1.86  \times  10^{‚àí12}$ cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> is predicted for the rate coefficient in the zero-temperature limit, which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal rate coefficient of the Cl+H<sub>2</sub> reaction at 300 K.</p>

				<title>Hydration dynamics of protein molecules in aqueous solution: Unity among diversity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0317-0325</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dielectric dispersion and NMRD experiments have revealed that a significant fraction of water molecules in the hydration shell of various proteins do not exhibit any slowing down of dynamics. This is usually attributed to the presence of the hydrophobic residues (HBR) on the surface, although HBRs alone cannot account for the large amplitude of the fast component. Solvation dynamics experiments and also computer simulation studies, on the other hand, repeatedly observed the presence of a non-negligible slow component. Here we show, by considering three well-known proteins (<i>lysozyme, myoglobin</i> and <i>adelynate</i> kinase), that the fast component arises <i>partly</i> from the response of those water molecules that are hydrogen bonded with the backbone oxygen (BBO) atoms. These are structurally and energetically less stable than those with the side chain oxygen (SCO) atoms. In addition, the electrostatic interaction energy distribution (EIED) of individual water molecules (hydrogen bonded to SCO) with side chain oxygen atoms shows a <i>surprising</i> two <i>peak character</i> with the lower energy peak almost <i>coincident</i> with the energy distribution of water hydrogen bonded to backbone oxygen atoms (BBO). This two peak contribution appears to be quite general as we find it for lysozyme, myoglobin and adenylate kinase (ADK). <i>The sharp peak of EIED at small energy</i> (at less than 2 $k_{B}T$) <i>for the BBO atoms, together with the first peak of EIED of SCO and the HBRs on the protein surface, explain why a large fraction (‚àº 80&#37;) of water in the protein hydration layer remains almost as mobile as bulk water</i>. Significant slowness arises only from the hydrogen bonds that populate the second peak of EIED at larger energy (at about 4 k$_B$T). Thus, if we consider hydrogen bond interaction alone, only 15-20&#37; of water molecules in the protein hydration layer can exhibit slow dynamics, resulting in an average relaxation time of about 5-10 ps. The latter estimate assumes a time constant of 20-100 ps for the slow component. Interestingly, relaxation of water molecules hydrogen bonded to back bone oxygen exhibit an initial component faster than the bulk, suggesting that hydrogen bonding of these water molecules remains frustrated. This explanation of the heterogeneous and non-exponential dynamics of water in the hydration layer is quantitatively consistent with all the available experimental results, and provides unification among diverse features.</p>

				<title>The relevance of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) in inorganic materials chemistry</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0339-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have evolved to be an important family and a corner stone for research in the area of inorganic chemistry. The progress made since 2000 has attracted researchers from other disciplines to actively engage themselves in this area. This cooperative synergy of different scientific believes have provided important edge and spread to the chemistry of metal-organic frameworks. The ease of synthesis coupled with the observation of properties in the areas of catalysis, sorption, separation, luminescence, bioactivity, magnetism, etc., are a proof of this synergism. In this article, we present the recent developments in this area.</p>

				<title>Excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction in non-aqueous reverse micelles: Effects of solvent confinement and electrolyte concentration</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0355-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Steady state and time resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopy have been employed to investigate the effects of solvent confinement and electrolyte concentration on excited state intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) reaction in 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl) benzonitrile (P5C), 4-(1-piperidinyl) benzonitrile (P6C), and 4-(1-morpholenyl) benzonitrile (M6C) in AOT/n-heptane/acetonitrile and AOT/n-heptane/methanol reverse micelles. Dramatic confinement effects have been revealed via a huge reduction (factor ranging between 100 and 20) over bulk values of both equilibrium and reaction rate constants. A strong dependence on the size of the confinement ($W_s$) of these quantities has also been observed. $W_s$ dependent average static dielectric constant, viscosity and solvation time-scale have been determined. Estimated dielectric constants for confined methanol and acetonitrile show a decrease from the respective bulk values by a factor of 3-5 and viscosities increased by a factor of 2 at the highest $W_s$ considered. Addition of electrolyte at $W_s = 5$ for acetonitrile is found to produce a linear increase of confined solvent viscosity but leads to a non-monotonic electrolyte concentration dependence of average solvation time. Reaction rate constant is found to decrease linearly with electrolyte concentration for P5C and P6C but non-monotonically for M6C, the highest decrease for all the molecules being ‚àº 20&#37; over the value in the absence of added electrolyte in the solvent pool. The observed huge reduction in reaction rate constant is attributed to the effects of decreased solution polarity, enhanced viscosity and slowed-down solvent reorganization of the solvent under confinement in these non-aqueous reverse micelles.</p>

				<title>Formation of fractals by the self-assembly of interpolymer adducts of polymethacrylic acid with complementary polymers in aqueous solution</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0375-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interpolymer adducts of poly(methacrylic acid), (PMAA), with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) in presence of sodium chloride or potassium chloride form highly ordered fractal patterns in films on glass surface on drying at ambient temperature. The structure, morphology and the conditions under which the formation of fractal patterns occurs were investigated by SEM, EDX and confocal microscopic techniques. Self-organization of PMAA with complementary polymers such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is well-known and in the presence of sodium chloride formation of the fractals in films of the adducts is a novel observation. Fractal formation occurs due to the aggregation of interpolymer adducts. The composition of the fractals in the film is studied by EDX and confocal microscopic images of the fluorophores covalently bound to PMAA. In presence of salts, sodium chloride or potassium chloride, micellar like entities of 80 nm size were formed which further aggregate to form fractal patterns. It is suggested that the fractals result from the interpolymer adduct by Diffusion Limited Aggregation mechanism.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0403-0410</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis, crystal structure, thermal characterization, FTIR and Raman measurements are given for a new mixed compound cesium-ammonium tellurate. X-ray study showed that the [Cs<sub>0.92</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>0.08</sub>]<sub>2</sub>TeCl<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/mnc, with a = 7.452 (1) &#197;, c = 10.544 (3) &#197; and Z = 2. The refinement converged at room temperature to $R_p = 0.093$ and $R_{wp} = 0.076$. The structure is considered as isolated octahedral TeCl<sub>4</sub>Br$^{2‚àí}_2$. These anions show a 4&#176; rotation around the fourfold axis against the cubic arrangement of the K<sub>2</sub>PtCI<sub>6</sub> type structure. The monovalent cations (Cs<sup>+</sup>/NH$^+_4$) are located between the octahedra ensuring the stability of the structure by ionic and hydrogen bonding contacts: Cs‚Ä¶Cl/Br and N-H$\ldots\ldots$Cl/Br. A DTA/TGA experiment at high temperature reveals one endothermic peak at 780K for this compound. At low temperature a transition from phase I to phase II was detected at 213K by DSC. This transition, confirmed by Raman analysis, can be attributed to an order-disorder phase transition.</p>

				<title>Mechanistic aspects of Os(VIII) catalysed oxidation of loop diuretic drug furosemide by Ag(III) periodate complex in aqueous alkaline medium</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0421-0430</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of oxidation of a loop diuretic drug furosemide (Fur) by diperiodatoargentate(III) (DPA) has been investigated in the presence of osmium(VIII) (Os(VIII)) used as homogeneous catalyst in alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of 0.20mol dm<sup>-3</sup> spectrophotometrically attached with HI-TECH SFA-12 stopped flow accessory. The stoichiometry was 1:2 (Fur:DPA). The order of the reaction with respect to [DPA] was unity while the order with respect to [Fur] was less than unity over the concentration range studied. The rate increased with an increase in [OH‚àí] and decreased with an increase in [IO$^‚àí_4$]. The order with respect to [Os(VIII)] was unity. The oxidation products were identified as 2-(4-carboxy-2-oxo-but-3-enylamino)-4-chloro-5-sulfamoyl-benzoic acid and Ag(I). A suitable mechanism was proposed. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of the reaction mechanism were calculated. Kinetic experiments suggest that [Ag(H<sub>2</sub>IO<sub>6</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] is the reactive silver(III) species and [OsO<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2‚àí</sup> is the reactive Os(VIII) species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of novel ammonium derivatives were synthesized and examined for their antimicrobial efficacy. Comparison of antimicrobial spectrum revealed that compounds <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>16</b>  and <b>23</b>  had strong potential against pathogens <i>in vitro</i>. Cytotoxicity results showed compound <b>9</b>  to be least toxic, it is non-toxic to A549 and U87 cells in MTT assay and exhibits marginal toxicity (15-20&#37;) to human erythrocytes at a concentration of 1000 ùúág/ml as compared to 100&#37; lysis of cells by 31.25 ùúág/ml of the standard drug amphotericin B. This compound has MIC values in the range of 1.95-31.25 ùúág/disc in DDA against different pathogens and may considered to be an important lead antimicrobial molecule for further exploration.</p>

				<title>Controlled free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate with cobalt acetoacetonate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The polymerization of vinyl acetate with the complex catalyst of cobalt acetoacetonate [Co (acac)<sub>2</sub>] and DMF ligand with benzoyl peroxide initiator has been successfully carried out in bulk and in solution. The bulk polymerization has been used in a new route consisting of a one-step polymer formation in a fine capillary tube. In this process, the high rate of propagation was used to carry out the reaction in a microcapillary tube. Under 60&#176;C, the colour-free reaction without solid catalyst impurity was 95&#37; complete within a few hours. The high molecular weight of polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) with its relatively low molecular distribution without unreacted monomer provided a new method in microprocessing of the controlled radical polymerization of vinyl acetate in a one-step polymerization process. PVAc polymerization systems showed induction time, which was reduced in this reaction with using complex of DMF/ Co(acac)<sub>2</sub>. The kinetics of the reaction with a smaller degree of branching from this catalyst indicated that the electronegativity of the transition metal and diffusion of the homogeneous catalyst with DMF are important factors of fast polymerization in the bulk. Thermal properties of the polymer indicated a lower glass transition state. The easily reformed or stretched microsolid polymer demonstrated 20&#37; crystallinity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>PEFCs employing Nafion-silica (Nafion-SiO<sub>2</sub>) and Nafion-mesoporous zirconium phosphate (Nafion-MZP) composite membranes are subjected to accelerated-durability test at 100&#176;C and 15&#37; relative humidity (RH) at open-circuit voltage (OCV) for 50 h and performance compared with the PEFC employing pristine Nafion-1135 membrane. PEFCs with composite membranes sustain the operating voltage better with fluoride-ion-emission rate at least an order of magnitude lower than PEFC with pristine Nafion-1135 membrane. Reduced gas-crossover, fast fuel-cell-reaction kinetics and superior performance of the PEFCs with Nafion-SiO<sub>2</sub> and Nafion-MZP composite membranes in relation to the PEFC with pristine Nafion-1135 membrane support the long-term operational usage of the former in PEFCs. An 8-cell PEFC stack employing Nafion-SiO<sub>2</sub> composite membrane is also assembled and successfully operated at 60&#176;C without external humidification.</p>

				<title>Voltammetric determination of dopamine and norepinphrine on a glassy carbon electrode modified with poly (L-aspartic acid)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0537-0544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A convenient and useful method for the voltammetric determination of dopamine (DA) and norepinphrine (NE) based on poly(L-aspartic acid) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) is reported in this paper. The modified electrode exhibits excellent electro-catalytic activities for the oxidation-reduction of DA and NE, as well as eliminating the interference of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). Factors influencing the detection processes are optimized and the kinetic parameters are calculated. Under the optimal conditions, the anodic peak currents of DA and NE are linear with their concentration and the detection limits (S/N = 3) are $1.0 \times 10^{‚àí9}$ mol L<sup>-1</sup> for DA and $4.31 \times 10^{‚àí9}$ mol L<sup>-1</sup> for NE, respectively. The practical application of this method is demonstrated by determining the concentration of NE and DA in injection which is commercially available with satisfactory results. Compared with other electrochemical methods, this method is simple, highly selective and sensitive.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0551-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Covalent crosslinking of carbon nanostructures of different dimensionalities such as nanodiamond, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and graphene can yield useful homo- and hetero-binary conjugates. Binary conjugation of the nanocarbons has been achieved by introducing symmetrical amide-linkages between acid (-COOH) functionalized nanocarbons and a diamine-linker. The binary conjugates have been characterized by using transmission electron microscopy as well as infrared, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Dispersions of covalently crosslinked binary conjugates of nanocarbons could be obtained in dimethyl formamide (DMF). Composites of the binary conjugates with polymer can be readily prepared by using the DMF suspensions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have demonstrated a simple, scalable and inexpensive method based on microwave plasma for synthesizing 5 to 10 g/h of nanomaterials. Luminescent nano silicon particles were synthesized by homogenous nucleation of silicon vapour produced by the radial injection of silicon tetrachloride vapour and nano titanium nitride was synthesized by using liquid titanium tetrachloride as the precursor. The synthesized nano silicon and titanium nitride powders were characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM, SEM and BET. The characterization techniques indicated that the synthesized powders were indeed crystalline nanomaterials.</p>

The crystal structure of <b>2</b> comprises a one-dimensional polymeric network bridged by NCS<sup>‚àí</sup> anions. The antibacterial activities of Cltpy and its Cd(II) complexes are tested against different bacteria. Both complexes have shown good activity against all the tested bacteria.

				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of the title complex with selected glycine-containing dipeptides(L-L'H) such as glycyl-glycine(L-L<sup>1</sup>H), glycyl-L-alanine (L-L<sup>2</sup>H) and glycyl-L-leucine(L-L<sup>3</sup>H) has been studied spectrophotometrically in aqueous medium as a function of [substrate complex], [ligand] and temperature. The reaction has been monitored at 600 nm where the spectral difference between the reactant and product is a maximum. At pH 7.4, the interaction with studied dipeptides shows two parallel steps. i.e., it shows a non-linear dependence on the concentration of dipeptides; both processes are ligand-dependent. The rate constants for the processes are: k$_1 \tilde 10^{‚àí3}$ s<sup>-1</sup> and k$_2 \tilde 10^{‚àí5}$ s<sup>-1</sup>. The activation parameters were calculated from Eyring plots. Based on the kinetic and activation parameters an associative interchange mechanism is proposed for the interaction processes. From the temperature dependence of the outer sphere association equilibrium constant, the thermodynamic parameters were also calculated. The product of the reaction has been characterized by IR and ESI-mass spectroscopic analysis.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of dehydrobenzoannulenes with pyrene core</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0597-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis of dehydrobenzoannulenes (DBAs) with pyrene core from 1,8-diethynylpyrene and 1,3,6,8-tetraethynylpyrene as building blocks is reported. A sequence involving Sonogashira coupling, Corey- Fuchs reaction and oxidative coupling (Eglinton coupling) is used for the synthesis of pyrene-based dehydrobenzoannulenes. Due to the presence of pyrenechromophore these DBAs and their precursors are highly fluorescent and emit in the visible region, due to extended conjugation of the acetylenic units with the pyrene core.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A small library of novel class of biquinoline containing pyridine moiety were synthesized by a one-pot cyclocondensation of 2-chloro-3-formyl quinoline, active methylene compounds and 3-(pyridine-3- ylamino)cyclohex-2-enone in the presence of catalytic amount of sodium hydroxide. The protocol offers rapid synthesis of structurally diverse novel class of some biquinoline pyridine hybrids for antimicrobial screening. These compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (<i>Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium tetani, Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>), Gram-negative bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae</i>) and antifungal activity against <i>Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans</i>. Some of the biquinoline compounds were found to be more potent or equipotent than the first line standard drugs. The compounds were evaluated for their <i>in vitro</i> antitubercular activity against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> H37Rv strain using Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Compound <b>4g</b> showed a compelling activity at 6.25 ùúág/mL with a 96&#37; inhibition and could be ideally suited for further modifications to obtain more efficacious compounds in the fight against tuberculosis.</p>

The formation and antimicrobial behaviour of the bisthiadiazolines <b>4a(a&#8242;-f&#8242;)</b> and <b>4b(a&#8242;-f&#8242;)</b> are found to be independent of nature of the internal spacer unit.</p>

				<page>0731-0739</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The characteristics of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding for a series of 19 different derivatives of ùõΩ-aminoacroleine have been systematically analysed at the B3LYP/6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> level of theory. The topological properties of the electron density distributions for N-H$\cdots$O intramolecular bridges have been analysed by the Bader theory of atoms in molecules. The electron density (ùúå) and Laplacian ($\nabla^2 \rho$) properties at critical points of the relevant bonds, estimated by AIM calculations, showed that N-H$\cdots$O have low and positive character ($\nabla^2 \rho &#62; 0$), consistent with electrostatic character of the hydrogen bond. The vibrational study of the hydrogen bonded systems showed negative (red) shifts for the $\nu_{(N‚àíH)}$ stretching mode. The ùúã-electron delocalization parameter (ùëÑ) as a geometrical indicator of a local aromaticity and the geometry-based HOMA have also been calculated. Furthermore, the analysis of hydrogen bond in this molecule and its derivatives by natural bond orbital (NBO) methods support the DFT results. The results of AIM and NBO analysis as well as $\nu_{(N‚àíH)}$ were further used for estimation of the hydrogen bonding interactions and the forces driving their formation. The various correlations were found between geometrical, energetic and topological parameters. The substituent effect was also analysed and it was found that the strongest hydrogen bonds exist for N<sup>+</sup>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and Cl substituents while the weakest ones for COOCH<sub>3</sub>.</p>

				<title>Substrate integrated Lead-Carbon hybrid ultracapacitor with flooded, absorbent glass mat and silica-gel electrolyte configurations</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lead-Carbon hybrid ultracapacitors (Pb-C HUCs) with flooded, absorbent-glass-mat (AGM) and silica-gel sulphuric acid electrolyte configurations are developed and performance tested. Pb-C HUCs comprise substrate-integrated PbO<sub>2</sub> (SI-PbO<sub>2</sub>) as positive electrodes and high surface-area carbon with graphite-sheet substrate as negative electrodes. The electrode and silica-gel electrolyte materials are characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, Rheometry, BET surface area, and FTIR spectroscopy in conjunction with electrochemistry. Electrochemical performance of SI-PbO<sub>2</sub> and carbon electrodes is studied using cyclic voltammetry with constant-current charge and discharge techniques by assembling symmetric electrical-double-layer capacitors and hybrid Pb-C HUCs with a dynamic Pb(porous)/PbSO<sub>4</sub> reference electrode. The specific capacitance values for 2 V Pb-C HUCs are found to be 166 F/g, 102 F/g and 152 F/g with a faradaic efficiency of 98&#37;, 92&#37; and 88&#37; for flooded, AGM and gel configurations, respectively.</p>

				<title>Does polar interaction influence medium viscosity? A computer simulation investigation using model liquids</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0763-0771</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics simulations of model liquids interacting via Lennard-Jones (L-J) and Stockmayer (SM) interactions have been carried out to explore the effects of the longer-ranged dipole-dipole interaction on solvent viscosity and diffusion. Switching on of the dipolar interaction at a fixed density and temperature has been found to increase the viscosity over that of the LJ liquid, the extent of increase being a few percent to as large as ‚àº60&#37; depending on the magnitude of the solvent dipole moment used in the SM potential. The simulated translational and rotational diffusion coefficients show strong dipole moment and temperature dependences, eventhough effects of these parameters on solvent-solvent radial distribution function are moderate. Interestingly, a partial solute-solvent decoupling is observed when the simulated translational and rotational diffusion coefficients are connected to the simulated viscosity coefficients via the Stokes-Einstein (SE) and Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relations. In the limit of large dipole moment, simulated self-part of the van Hove correlation function at intermediate times reveals a departure from the Gaussian distribution with particle displacement. This suggests that dynamic heterogeneity is one of the reasons for the departure of centre-of-mass diffusion from the SE relation in these model systems.</p>

				<page>0791-0799</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of the reaction of HOBt with [Rh(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(OH)]<sup>2+</sup> has been studied spectrophotometrically in aqueous medium as a function of [Rh(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>OH<sup>2+</sup>], [HOBt], pH and temperature. At pH 4.3, the reaction proceeds via a rapid outer sphere association complex formation step followed by two consecutive steps. The first of these involves ligand-assisted anation, while the second involves chelation as the second aqua ligand is displaced. The association equilibrium constant for the outer sphere complex formation has been evaluated together with the rate constants for the two subsequent steps. The activation parameters for both steps have been evaluated using Eyrings equation. Thermodynamic parameters calculated from the temperature dependence of the outer sphere association equilibrium constants are also consistent with an associative mode of activation. The product of the reaction has been characterized by IR and ESI-mass spectroscopic analysis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of interaction between <i>cis</i>-[RuCl(Me<sub>2</sub>SO)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and some selected dipeptides such as glycyl glycine(gly gly), glycyl alanine(Gly-L-ala) and glycyl-L-leucine(gly leu) has been studied spectrophotometrically as a function of [RuCl(Me<sub>2</sub>SO)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)$^+_2$], [dipeptide] and temperature at a particular pH(5.0), where the substrate complex exists predominantly as a diaqua species (in aqueous solution) and dipeptides as the zwitter ions. The reaction has been found to proceed via two distinct consecutive steps i.e., it shows a non-linear dependence on the concentration of dipeptide: first process is dependent and the second step is independent of ligand concentration respectively. The rate constants for the processes are: k$_1 \tilde 10^{‚àí3}$s<sup>-1</sup> and k$_2 \tilde  10^{‚àí5}$ s<sup>-1</sup>. The activation parameters were calculated from Eyring plots suggests an associative mechanism for the interaction process. From the temperature dependence of the outer sphere association equilibrium constants, the thermodynamic parameters were also calculated, which gives a negative ùõ•G<sup>0</sup> value at all temperatures studied, supporting the spontaneous formation of an outer sphere association complex.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0809-0819</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of oxidation of L-leucine by diperiodatocuprate (III) (DPC) in aqueous alkaline medium at a constant ionic strength of 0.10mol dm<sup>-3</sup> was studied spectrophotometrically. The reaction between L-leucine and DPC in alkaline medium exhibits 1:4 stoichiometry (L-leucine: DPC). The reaction is of first order in [DPC] and has less than unit order in both [L-leucine] and [alkali]. However, the order in [Lleucine] and [alkali] changes from first order to zero order as their concentration increase. Intervention of free radicals was observed in the reaction. Increase in periodate concentration decreased the rate. The oxidation reaction in alkaline medium has been shown to proceed via a monoperiodatocuprate (III) - L-leucine complex, which decomposed slowly in a rate-determining step followed by other fast steps to give the products. The main oxidative products were identified by spot test and GC-MS. The reaction constants involved in the different steps of the mechanism were calculated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Selenium dioxide catalysed acetic acid hydrazide oxidation by bromate was studied in hydrochloric acid medium. The order in oxidant concentration, substrate and catalyst were found to be unity. Increasing hydrogen ion concentration increases the rate of the reaction due to protonation equilibria of the oxidant. The mechanism of the reaction involves prior complex formation between the catalyst and substrate, hydrazide, followed by its oxidation by diprotonated bromate in a slow step. Acetic acid was found to be the oxidation product. Other kinetic data like effect of solvent polarity and ionic strength on the reaction support the proposed mechanism.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, characterization and investigation of catalytic activity of Cu$_{1‚àíx}$Co$_x$Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocatalysts in ùë°-butylation of ùëù-cresol</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0827-0834</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, tertiary butylation of ùëù-cresol was carried out in the presence of Cu$_{1‚àíx}$Co$_x$Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (x = 0 to 1) nanocatalysts by employing methyl-<i>tert</i>-butyl ether (MTBE) and <i>tert</i>-butyl alcohol (TBA) as alkylation agents. Effects of temperature, mole ratio, type and catalyst composition, time and solvent in reaction conditions were investigated. These nanocatalysts were synthesized using hydrothermal method. The characterization of these catalysts was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR). These nanocatalysts can be recovered and recycled. A good correlation was found between the activity, in terms of ùëù-cresol conversion and various product selectivities for this reaction, and also the acid-base properties of the catalysts. Nano-sized Cu<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, in comparison to the other nanocatalysts discussed in this report is the most active nanocatalyst. The only product of this reaction is $2-t$-butyl ùëù-cresol with selectivity of 100&#37; and ùëù-cresol conversion is 70&#37;. The possible mechanism for this reaction system was discussed based on the reaction results. The reaction mechanism proposed involves the interaction of phenoxide from phenol and the <i>tert</i>-butyl cation from isobutene on Cu$_{1‚àíx}$Co$_x$Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.</p>

					<p>Oxidative decomposition of low concentrations (50-1000 ppm) of diluted benzene in air was carried out in a nonthermal plasma (NTP) dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor with the inner electrode made up of stainless steel fibres (SMF) modified with transition metal oxides in such a way to integrate the catalyst in discharge zone. Typical results indicate the better performance of MnO$_x$ and TiO<sub>2</sub>/MnO$_x$ modified systems, which may be attributed to the <i>in situ</i> decomposition of ozone on the surface of MnO$_x$ that may lead to the formation of atomic oxygen; whereas ultraviolet light induced photocatalytic oxidation may be taking place with TiO<sub>2</sub> modified systems. Water vapour improved the selectivity to total oxidation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Organic synthesis generally required large amount of solvent, avoiding the use of organic solvents in synthesis is a paradigm shift directed at developing more benign chemistry, and with ionic liquids surprisingly can lead to access to new compounds. An elegant one-pot synthesis of quinoline derivatives has been achieved by reaction of substituted anilines with ùõΩ-ketoester at 60&#176;C in ethanol using an ionic liquid [Et<sub>3</sub>NH]<sup>+</sup>[BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>‚àí</sup>as catalyst. All the reactions gave products with high degree of purity and excellent yield (78-93&#37;) within the shorter span of time (20-65 min) than those reactions with conventional methods. The screening of solvents as well as the reuse of ionic liquid has been evaluated. The structure of the products has been elucidated by spectral and analytical data. The present scope and potential economic impact of the reaction are demonstrated by the synthesis of substituted quinolines. Remaining challenges and future perspectives of the new transformation are discussed.</p>

				<title>Cellulose sulphuric acid as a biodegradable catalyst for conversion of aryl amines into azides at room temperature under mild conditions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0889-0892</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article describes simple and efficient method for the diazotization and azidation of different aromatic amines over cellulose sulphuric acid, sodium nitrite and sodium azide under mild conditions at room temperature. Various aryl amines possessing electron-withdrawing groups or electron-donating groups have been converted into the corresponding aryl azides with 71-99&#37; yields. The use of mild reaction conditions, avoids the use of harmful acids and toxic solvents and short reaction times are advantages of this methodology. The selected catalyst is found to be highly efficient and recyclable.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, structure, thermal and NLO characterization of 4-hydroxy tetramethylpiperazinium picrate crystals</title>

				<page>0951-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Good quality single crystals of 4-hydroxy tetramethylpiperazinium picrate (TMPP) were grown by slow evaporation solution growth method at room temperature. The average dimensions of the grown crystals were $0.6 \times 0.2 \times 0.2$ cm<sup>3</sup>. The solubility of the compound was estimated using methanol and acetone. The elemental analysis confirms the formation of the compound in the stoichiometric proportion. The UV-visible transmittance study indicates that the crystal possesses minimum transmittance at 370 nm and no absorption at 470-900 nm. The Bragg peaks obtained in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern confirm its crystallinity. The thermal behaviour of the crystal was investigated using thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques. The structure of the compound was determined by using single crystal X-ray diffraction method. The compound was found to be crystallize in the monoclinic space group P2<sub>(1)</sub>/c (a = 6.9513(8)&#197;, b = 11.8016(14)&#197;, c = 22.018(2)&#197;, ùõº = 90.00&#176;, ùõΩ = 92.575(2)&#176;, ùõæ = 90.00&#176;). The thermal anomalies observed in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) heating and cooling cycles indicate the occurrence of first order phase transition. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and polarized Raman spectral analyses were used to confirm the presence of various functional groups in the compound. The nonlinear optical property (NLO) of the crystal was analysed by Kurtz-Perry powder technique and found that the compound has SHG efficiency 1.5 times greater that of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Anatase Ag-TiO<sub>2</sub> microwires with high sensitivity and photocatalytic activity were synthesized via polyol synthesis route followed by a simple surface modification and chemical reduction approach for attachment of silver. The superior performance of the Ag-TiO<sub>2</sub> composite microwires is attributed to improved surface reactivity, mass transport and catalytic property as a result of wiring the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface with Ag nanoparticles. Compared to the TiO<sub>2</sub> microwires, Ag-TiO<sub>2</sub> microwires exhibited three times higher sensitivity in the detection of cationic dye such as methylene blue. Photocatalytic degradation efficiency was also found to be significantly enhanced at constant illumination protocols and observation times. The improved performance is attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier between TiO<sub>2</sub> and Ag nanoparticles leading to a fast transport of photogenerated electrons to the Ag nanoparticles.</p>

				<page>0979-0984</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work reports on the preparation of nanoclusters of manganese oxide using biotemplating techniques. Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) on quartz using cationic lipid [Dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DOMA)] and mixed systems with neutral phospholipids dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) have been used as templates to synthesize these nanoparticles in a waterbased medium at room temperature. The Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show manganese oxide nanostructures that are composed of crystals or small clusters in the size range of 20-50 nm in diameter. Small angle XRD showed that template removal through calcining process results in nanostructures of the manganese oxide in sizes from 30 to 50 nm. Using these organized assemblies it is possible to control the nano and mesoscopic morphologies of particles and both rod-like and spherical particles can be synthesized.</p>

				<title>Comparative study of spectroscopic properties of the low-lying electronic states of 2,4-pentadien-1-iminium cation and its N-substituted analogues</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0985-0994</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Semiempirical and <i>ab initio</i>-based CI methods have been employed to study the low-lying electronic states of 2,4-pentadien-1-iminium cation and its N-substituted analogues with electron-donating (methyl, isopropyl) and electron-withdrawing (fluoromethyl) groups on nitrogen. Variations of the dihedral angles ($\Gamma_3$, $\Gamma_4$) of the ground state have given the global minima and global maxima at (180&#176;, 180&#176;) and (90&#176;, 0&#176;) conformations, respectively, with some exceptions in the case of fluoromethyl compound. Increase in the +I effect on nitrogen shifts the TICT conical intersection point away from the 90&#176; ($\Gamma_3$ dihedral angle) value, when the $\Gamma_4$ value is kept fixed at 180&#176;. Transition moment values of the allowed S<sub>0</sub>(1A$_g$ -like) ‚Üí S<sub>1</sub> (2B$_u$-like) transitions are expectedly higher than the forbidden S0(1A$_g$ -like) ‚Üí S<sub>2</sub>(2A$_g$ -like) transitions by almost 5.6 D. Radiative lifetime values of the first excited states are calculated to be around 215 ps for all the four compounds. At (180&#176;, 180&#176;) conformation the vertical excitation energy (VEE) between the S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> states of the 2,4-pentadieniminium cation is found to be 3.3 eV, which corresponds to the absorption wavelength value of roughly 375 nm. The VEE value increases with substituents having +I effect on nitrogen, while for the fluoromethyl compound it is calculated to be around 2.85 eV. The energy gap between the first two excited singlet states is found to have the least value in the isopropyl-substituted compound, where the S<sub>2</sub> state contains a huge contribution from the HOMO<sup>2</sup>‚ÜíLUMO<sup>2</sup> configuration.</p>

				<title>Theoretical studies on a series of 1,2,4-triazoles derivatives as potential high energy density compounds</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0995-1006</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory calculations at B3LYP/6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> and B3P86/6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> levels were performed to predict the densities (ùúå), detonation velocities (D), pressures (P) and the thermal stabilities for a series of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives for looking high energy density compounds (HEDCs). The heats of formation (HOFs) are also calculated via designed isodesmic reactions. The calculations on the bond dissociation energies (BDEs) indicate that the position of the subsitutent group has great effect on the BDE and the BDEs of the initial scission step are between 31 and 65 kcal/mol. In addition, the condensed phase heats of formation are also calculated for the title compounds. These results would provide basic information for further studies of HEDCs.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>1025-1032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of methods have been proposed for the modification of the Ritter reaction. However, many of these methods involve the use of strongly acidic conditions, stoichiometric amounts of reagents, harsh reaction conditions and extended reaction times. Therefore, the development of mild, efficient, convenient and benign reagents for the Ritter reaction is desirable. In this research, we have developed a clean and environmentally friendly protocol for the synthesis of amides by using different benzylic or tertiary alcohols and different nitriles in the presence of silica-bonded N- propyl sulphamic acid (SBNPSA) as catalyst under solvent-free conditions in high yields.</p>

We have synthesised and characterized some novel and suitably substituted heterocyclyl linked benzaldehydes and anilines, which can be easily and very readily derivatized to all the above mentioned classes to generate new chemical entities of broader biological significance. Synthesis of their benzylidene thiazolidinedione and diethyl malonate and also benzyl diethyl malonate and alpha-bromoesters derivatives is reported in some of the cases in the present work.</p>

The synergistic combination ofMWwith IL can potentially go a long way tomeet the increasing demand for chemical processes. This homogeneous catalytic procedure is simple and efficient. The catalyst can be reused at least four times with almost complete retention in its activity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series ofMn(II)bipy complexes with different loading of Mn<sup>2+</sup> supported on HMS was prepared. These samples were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG-DSC), Ultraviolet and Visible spectra (UV-Vis) and Fourier transforms Infrared (FT-IR). The catalytic activity of the supportedMn(II)bipy complexes, [Mn(bipy)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>/HMS was evaluated in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the liquid phase using tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant. The effects of Mn<sup>2+</sup> loading and various solvents on the conversion and selectivity were studied. A second order function for the variation in catalytic activity with respect to the loading of Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions in different catalyst samples was observed. The activity of the [Mn(bipy)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>/HMS catalyst differs with the type of the solvent and in this case, acetonitrile gives the best conversion results. The kinetic of benzyl alcohol oxidation was investigated at temperatures of 27, 46, 60, 75 and 90&#176;C using [Mn(bipy)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>/HMS and excess TBHP. The order of reaction with respect to benzyl alcohol was determined to be pseudo-first order. The value of the apparent activation energy was also determined.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Functionalization of oxidized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by a zwitterionic interaction (COO‚àíNH$^+_3$) between protonated amine on crown ether and an oxyanion from a carboxylic acid group on SWCNT has been described. This ionic interaction has led to a considerable increase in the solubility of SWCNTs in both organic and aqueous solvents such as ethanol, dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide, and H<sub>2</sub>O. The highest solubility was attained in DMF and DMSO. The ionic bonded 4-benzo-9-crown-3 ether allowed the hosting of Li<sup>+</sup>. The ionic bond of crown ether (4-(benzo-9-crown-3)) to SWCNT was identified and confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron-microscopy, atomic force microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis methods.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Expanded porphyrin analogues with unique figure-eight conformation were prepared by way of useful pyrrole intermediates such as <i>bis</i>(azafulvene)s and 2-borylpyrrole. Supramolecular chirogenesis of cyclooctapyrrole <b>O1</b> with 32ùúã-cycloconjugation was successfully applied to determine absolute configuration of chiral carboxylic acids. Dinuclear CuII complex of cyclooctapyrrole <b>O2</b> with interrupted ùúã-conjugation was resolved by HPLC into enantiomers and their helical handedness was determined by theoretical simulation of their CD spectral pattern. Enantioselective induction of helicity in the metal helicate formation in the presence of a chiral promoter was demonstrated by using (ùëÖ)-(+)-1-(1-phenyl)ethylamine that favoured ùëÉ, ùëÉ helicity. Dinuclear Co<sup>II</sup> complexes of cyclotetrapyrroletetrapyridine <b>O3</b> were found to be substitution labile and pick up amino acid anions in water. Those amino acid complexes of <b>O3Co</b><sub><b>2</b></sub> were rendered to adopt a particular unidirectional helical conformation preferentially depending on the ligated amino acid anion.</p>

Similar reaction with N-(naphthyl)picolinamide (<b>pic-nap</b>) yields an organoruthenium complex (<b>3</b>) via formation of a hydrido intermediate. Reaction of 2-(arylazo)phenols (<b>ap-R</b>) with [Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl] in refluxing ethanol affords a mono-hydrido intermediate (<b>4-R</b>), a di-hydrido intermediate (<b>5-R</b>) and an organoiridium complex (<b>6-R</b>) as the final product, where the azo-ligand is coordinated as CNO-donor. Reaction of <b>ap-R</b> ligands with [Rh(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl] yields organorhodium complexes (<b>7-R</b>) analogous to <b>6-R</b>, but without any hydrido intermediate.

				<title>Digestive ripening: a synthetic method <i>par excellence</i> for core-shell, alloy, and composite nanostructured materials</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1175-1180</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The solvated metal atom dispersion (SMAD) method has been used for the synthesis of colloids of metal nanoparticles. It is a top-down approach involving condensation of metal atoms in low temperature solvent matrices in a SMADreactor maintained at 77 K.Warming of the matrix results in a slurry ofmetal atoms that interact with one another to form particles that grow in size. The organic solvent solvates the particles and acts as a weak capping agent to halt/slow down the growth process to a certain extent. This as-prepared colloid consists of metal nanoparticles that are quite polydisperse. In a process termed as <i>digestive ripening</i>, addition of a capping agent to the as-prepared colloid which is polydisperse renders it highly monodisperse either under ambient or thermal conditions. In this, as yet not well-understood process, smaller particles grow and the larger ones diminish in size until the system attains uniformity in size and a dynamic equilibrium is established. Using the SMAD method in combination with digestive ripening process, highly monodisperse metal, core-shell, alloy, and composite nanoparticles have been synthesized. This article is a review of our contributions together with some literature reports on this methodology to realize various nanostructured materials.</p>

					<p>Electronic structural forms of selected mononuclear and dinuclear ruthenium complexes encompassing redox non-innocent terminal as well as bridging ligands have been addressed. The sensitive valence and spin situations of the complexes have been established in the native and accessible redox states via detailed analysis of their crystal structures, electrochemistry, UV/VIS/NIR spectroelectrochemistry, EPR signatures at the paramagnetic states and DFT calculations. Mononuclear complexes exhibit significant variations in valence and spin distribution processes based on the simple modification of the non-innocent ligand frameworks as well as electronic nature of the co-ligands, ùúé-donating or ùúã-accepting. Dinuclear complexes with modified pyrazine, ùëù-quinone and azo-derived redox-active bridging ligands show complex features including redoxinduced electron-transfer (RIET), remote metal to metal spin-interaction in a three-spin metal-bridge-metal arrangement as well as electron-transfer driven chemical transformation (EC).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Designing efficient phosphorus-based ligands to make catalysts for homogeneous catalysis has been a great challenge for chemists. Despite a plethora of phosphorus ligands ranging from simple tertiary phosphines to polyphosphines are known, the enthusiasm to generate new ones is mainly due to the demand from industry for economical and robust catalytic system operational under normal atmospheric conditions. In this context, we have developed new synthetic methodologies for making unusual inorganic ring systems containing trivalent phosphorus centres, novel phosphorus-based multidentate and hybrid ligands and explored their rich transition metal chemistry and catalytic applications. We have also fine tuned a few existing ligand systems with donor functionalities to employ them in homogeneous catalysis. The details are summarized in this account.</p>

				<title>Reactions of a stable dialkylsilylene and their mechanisms</title>

				<page>1205-1215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Various reactions for a stable dialkylsilylene, 2,2,5,5-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silacyclopentane-1,1-diyl (<b>1</b>), are summarized and their mechanisms are discussed. Silylene <b>1</b> isomerizes to the corresponding silaethene via the 1,2-trimethylsilyl migration. Reduction of <b>1</b> with alkali metals affords the corresponding radical anion <b>1</b><sup>.‚àí</sup> with a relatively small <sup>29</sup>Si hfs constant (2.99 mT) and a large g-factor (g = 2.0077) compared with those for trivalent silyl radicals. Photo-excitation of <b>1</b> generates the corresponding singlet excited state (<b>1</b>$^{1\ast}$) with the lifetime of 80.5 ns. The excited state reacts with C=C double bond compounds including benzene, naphthalene, and (ùê∏)- and (ùëç)-2-butenes. Although the thermal reactions of <b>1</b> with haloalkanes occur via radical mechanisms, the insertion into O-H, Si-H and Si-Cl bonds proceeds concertedly via the threemembered cyclic transition states. The reaction of <b>1</b> with H<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub> gives the Si-Cl insertion product exclusively, while the quantitative insertion to Si-H bond occurs when Me<sub>2</sub>SiHCl is used as a substrate. The origin of the rather unusual Si-H/Si-Cl selectivity is elucidated using DFT calculations. Silylene <b>1</b> adds to C=C, C‚â°C, and C=O ùúã bonds to afford the corresponding silacycles as stable compounds. The importance of the carbonyl silaylides during the reactions of silylenes with aldehydes and ketones is emphasized.</p>

				<page>1217-1228</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Binding of metal complexes of C2-glucosyl conjugates with DNA has been established by absorption and fluorescence studies. Conformational changes occurred in DNA upon binding have been studied by circular dichroism. All these studies are suggestive that the metal complexes bind to DNA through intercalation. Binding of di-nuclear copper complex 5 was found to be stronger when compared to the other complexes studied. Copper complexes were found to cleave the plasmid DNA in the absence of oxidizing or reducing agent, whereas, zinc complexes do not cleave. Metal complexes have shown toxicity to the HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines.Morphological studies, western blot and FACS analysis are suggestive of apoptotic cell death induced by the metal complexes. Di-nuclear copper complexes were found to be better as compared to the mononuclear ones in binding, plasmid cleavage and also in causing more cell death.</p>

					<p>Chalcogenated Schiff bases of 5-chloroisatin (<b>L1-L3</b>), 2-(methythio)benzaldehyde (<b>L4</b>), 2-acetylpyridine (<b>L5</b>) and benzaldehyde (<b>L6-L7</b>) have been synthesized. Both the carbonyl groups of 5- chloroisatin appear to be reactive (noticed for the first time) for making &#62;C=N bond, of course one at a time only. The <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C{<sup>1</sup>H}, <sup>77</sup>Se{<sup>1</sup>H} and <sup>125</sup>Te{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectroscopy have been used to establish the coexistence of two products, which were found in the ratio 53:47 (E = S), 55:45 (E = Se) and 81:19 (E = Te). The larger amount is of the one in which C=O group away from NH is derivatized. The two products are not separable. Palladium complexes (<b>1-4</b>) of Schiff bases of other three aldehydes were synthesized. The ligands as well as complexes were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [Pd(<b>L4/L5</b>)Cl][ClO<sub>4</sub>] (<b>1/2</b>) have been solved. The Pd-Se bond lengths are 2.4172(17) and 2.3675(4) &#197;, respectively for <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. The Pd-complexes (<b>3-4</b>) of <b>L6-L7</b> were explored for Suzuki-Miyaura coupling and found promising as 0.006 mol &#37; of <b>3</b> is sufficient to obtain good conversion with TON up to $1.58 \times  10^4$.</p>

				<title>Metal derivatives of heterocyclic-2-thiones: Variable donor ability, C-S rupture and new structural motifs</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1261-1268</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemistry of thio-ligands based on heterocyclic-2-thiones, namely, pyridine-2-thione (SNC<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), imidazolidine-2-thione (SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), imidazoline-2-thione (SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), 1-methyl-imidazoline-2-thione (SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) and thiazolidine-2-thione (S<sub>2</sub>NC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) with coinage and some other metals are described. The synthesis, solvent effect, isolation of new products after C-S rupture and crystal structure are also discussed. For example, copper(I) bromide with 1-methyl-imidazoline-2-thione (SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) in acetonitrile formed Cu<sup>I</sup> trinuclear complex, {Cu<sub>3</sub>($\kappa^1$-Br)<sub>3</sub>(ùúá-SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub>}¬∑CH<sub>3</sub>CN. This reaction in the presence of chloroform involved C-S bond rupture, oxidation of sulphur to sulphate and bromination of ring and formed a tetranuclear cluster, Cu<sub>4</sub>($\kappa^1$-N-(N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Br)<sub>4</sub>($\mu_4$-O)(ùúá-Br)<sub>6</sub>] (N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Br = 2-bromo-1-methyl-imidazole). The reaction of copper(I) chloride with 1-methyl-imidazoline-2-thione (SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) in acetonitrile also involved C-S rup ture and formed a chloro-bridged dinuclear complex [Cu<sub>2</sub>{$\kappa^2$-N,N-(N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S}<sub>2</sub>(ùúá-Cl)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] {(N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S = 1, 1'-dimethyl-2,2'-di-imidazolyl sulphide}. Significantly copper(I) bonded to more polarisable iodide ion (Cu-I) does not involve C-S rupture and in this case it formed Cu<sup>I</sup> polynuclear complex, {Cu<sub>2</sub>(ùúá-I)<sub>2</sub>(ùúá-SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}$_n$. Both copper(I) chloride and copper(I) bromide with 1-methyl-imidazoline-2-thione in dimethyl sulphoxide involved C-S rupture and oxidation of sulphur to sulphate and formed a sulphate chelated Cu<sup>II</sup> complex, [Cu<sup>II</sup>{$\kappa^2$-N,N-(N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S}($\eta^2$-O,OSO<sub>2</sub>)($\kappa^1$-OH<sub>2</sub>)]. Imidazolidine-2-thione (SN<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) with copper(I) chloride/bromide in dimethyl sulphoxide gave a sulphate bridged polynuclear complex, [Cu<sup>II</sup>{$\kappa^2$-N,N-(N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S}(ùúá-O,OSO<sub>2</sub>)($\kappa^1$-OH<sub>2</sub>)]$_n$ {(N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S = 2,2'-thio-di-2-imidazoline}. Other metals such as silver, zinc, cadmium and mercury formed monomers or dimers.</p>

				<title>Mechanistic studies of copper(II)-mediated oxidation of <i>vic</i>-dioxime to furoxan</title>

				<page>1269-1273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation of <i>vic</i>-dioximes to furoxans by copper(II) perchlorate in acetonitrile as the oxidant has been discussed. This method was found to be applicable for a broad range of <i>vic</i>-dioximes. Copper complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline derived furoxans were isolated by oxidation of the corresponding copper(II) complexes of 1,10-phenanthroline based dioximes. In exploring the mechanism of copper(II)-mediated oxidative cyclization of <i>vic</i>-dioxime, a transient blue species was observed in the reaction pathway. Based on the spectroscopic signatures and reactivity patterns, the intermediate was proposed to be a dioximatecopper(II)-dinitrosoalkene complex. These results along with the role of metal ion and solvent in the oxidative transformation reaction are discussed in this review.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper reports the synthesis and structural characterization of several organic-inorganic solids involving phosphomolybdate clusters. The Strandberg-type {P<sub>2</sub>Mo$^{\text{VI}}_5$O<sub>23</sub>} and the lower-valent {P<sub>4</sub>Mo$^V_6$O<sub>31</sub>} cluster based solids were isolated in the presence of $en$ (ethylenediamine) by controlling pH of the reaction medium. The lower-valent cluster invariably requires the presence of a suitable metal cation for further stabilization. A detailed investigation of the system was carried out where three different weak acids viz. oxalic acid, succinic acid and glycine were used in the entire pH range (1-12). Our results establish that the organic amine ($en$) is alone capable of reducing the molybdenum core in the absence of an organic acid at a suitable pH. Hence, pH of the reaction medium combined with suitable temperature favours the formation of lower-valent phosphomolybdate cluster. Higher pH favours the precipitation of a new sodium hydrogen phosphate.</p>

				<title>Calixarenes: Versatile molecules as molecular sensors for ion recognition study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1287-1299</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article presents a brief account on designing of calixarene-based molecular sensor for recognition of various metal ions and anions and also different analytical techniques to monitor the recognition event. This review focuses only on calix[4]arene derivatives, in which mainly the lower rim is modified incorporating either crown moiety to make calix-crown hybrid ionophore to encapsulate metal ions or some fluoregenic inorganic and organic moieties to use it as signalling unit. In order to investigate effect of conformation of the calixarene unit and steric crowding on ion selectivity, designing of these molecules have been made using both the cone and 1,3-alternate conformations of the calixarene unit and also incorporating bulky <i>tert</i>-butyl group in few cases to impose controlled steric crowding. Among various ions, here focuses are mainly on biologically and commercially important alkali metal ion such as K<sup>+</sup>, toxic metal ions such as Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, important transition metal ion such as Cu<sup>2+</sup> and toxic anion like F<sup>‚àí</sup>. The techniques used to monitor the recognition event and also to determine binding constants with strongly interacting ions are fluorescence, UV-vis and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. Most of the ionophores reported in this review have been characterized crystallographically, however no structural information (except one case) are incorporated in this article, as it will occupy space without significant enhancement of chemistry part. Different factors such as size of the ionophore cavity, size of metal ion, coordination sites/donor atoms, steric crowding and solvents, which determine selectivity have been discussed. Response of ion recognition process to different analytical techniques is another interesting factor discussed in this article.</p>

These complexes are characterized by a variety of techniques including; elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic and single crystal X-ray analysis.

				<title>Fabrication of optochemical and electrochemical sensors using thin films of porphyrin and phthalocyanine derivatives</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1315-1325</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the fabrication of thin films of porphyrin and metallophthalocyanine derivatives on different substrates for the optochemical detection of HCl gas and electrochemical determination of L-cysteine (CySH). Solid state gas sensor for HCl gas was fabricated by coating meso-substituted porphyrin derivatives on glass slide and examined optochemical sensing of HCl gas. The concentration of gaseous HCl was monitored from the changes in the absorbance of Soret band. Among the different porphyrin derivatives, <i>meso</i>-tetramesitylporphyrin (MTMP) coated film showed excellent sensitivity towards HCl and achieved a detection limit of 0.03 ppm HCl. Further, we have studied the self-assembly of 1,8,15,22-tetraaminometallophthalocyanine (4ùõº-MTAPc; M = Co and Ni) from DMF on GC electrode. The CVs for the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 4ùõº-Co<sup>II</sup>TAPc and 4ùõº4-Ni<sup>II</sup>TAPc show two pairs of well-defined redox couple corresponding to metal and ring. Using the 4ùõº-Co<sup>II</sup>TAPc SAM modified electrode, sensitive and selective detection of L-cysteine was demonstrated. Further, the SAM modified electrode also successfully separates the oxidation potentials of AA and CySH with a peak separation of 320mV.</p>

				<title>Photocytotoxic lanthanide complexes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1327-1342</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lanthanide complexes have recently received considerable attention in the field of therapeutic and diagnostic medicines. Among many applications of lanthanides, gadolinium complexes are used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents in clinical radiology and luminescent lanthanides for bioanalysis, imaging and sensing. The chemistry of photoactive lanthanide complexes showing biological applications is of recent origin. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive treatment modality of cancer using a photosensitizer drug and light. This review primarily focuses on different aspects of the chemistry of lanthanide complexes showing photoactivated DNA cleavage activity and cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Macrocyclic texaphyrin-lanthanide complexes are known to show photocytotoxicity with the PDT effect in near-IR light. Very recently, non-macrocyclic lanthanide complexes are reported to show photocytotoxicity in cancer cells. Attempts have been made in this perspective article to review and highlight the photocytotoxic behaviour of various lanthanide complexes for their potential photochemotherapeutic applications.</p>

				<title>Computational tools for mechanistic discrimination in the reductive and metathesis coupling reactions mediated by titanium(IV) isopropoxide</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1343-1352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A theoretical study has been carried out at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level to compare the reactivity of phenyl isocyanate and phenyl isothiocyanate towards titanium(IV) alkoxides. Isocyanates are shown to favour both mono insertion and double insertion reactions. Double insertion in a head-to-tail fashion is shown to be more exothermic than double insertion in a head-to-head fashion. The head-to-head double insertion leads to the metathesis product, a carbodiimide, after the extrusion of carbon dioxide. In the case of phenyl isothiocyanate, calculations favour the formation of only mono insertion products. Formation of a double insertion product is highly unfavourable. Further, these studies indicate that the reverse reaction involving the metathesis of N,N'-diphenyl carbodiimide with carbon dioxide is likely to proceed more efficiently than the metathesis reaction with carbon disulphide. This is in excellent agreement with experimental results as metathesis with carbon disulphide fails to occur. In a second study, multilayer MM/QM calculations are carried out on intermediates generated from reduction of titanium(IV) alkoxides to investigate the effect of alkoxy bridging on the reactivity of multinuclear Ti species. Bimolecular coupling of imines initiated by Ti(III) species leads to a mixture of diastereomers and not diastereoselective coupling of the imine. However if the reaction is carried out by a trimeric biradical species, diastereoselective coupling of the imine is predicted. The presence of alkoxy bridges greatly favours the formation of the d,l (¬±) isomer, whereas the intermediate without alkoxy bridges favours the more stable meso isomer. As a bridged trimeric species, stabilized by bridging alkoxy groups, correctly explains the diastereoselective reaction, it is the most likely intermediate in the reaction.</p>

					<p>Five Schiff base ligands have been utilized to explore metallo-pseudohalide (azide or cyanate) systems. These ligands are the 1:1 condensation products of 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde with ethanolamine (H<sub>2</sub>L<sup>1</sup>)/1-(2-aminoethyl)-piperidine (HL<sup>2</sup>)/ 4-(2-aminoethyl)-morpholine (HL<sup>3</sup>) or salicylaldehyde with 1-(2-aminoethyl)-piperidine (HL<sup>4</sup>)/4-(2-aminoethyl)-morpholine (HL<sup>5</sup>). The derived complexes are as follows: Four heterobridged ùúá-phenoxo-$\mu_{1,1}$-azide/cyanate dinickel(II) compounds of composition [Ni$^{\text{II}}_2$ (HL<sup>1</sup>)<sub>3</sub>($\mu_{1,1}$-N<sub>3</sub>)]$\cdot$3H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>1</b>), [Ni$^{\text{II}}_2$ (L<sup>2</sup>)<sub>2</sub>($\mu_{1,1}$-N<sub>3</sub>)(N<sub>3</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]¬∑CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH (<b>2</b>), [Ni$^{\text{II}}_2$ (L<sup>3</sup>)<sub>2</sub>-($\mu_{1,1}$-N<sub>3</sub>)(CH<sub>3</sub>CN)(H<sub>2</sub>O)](ClO<sub>4</sub>)¬∑H<sub>2</sub>O¬∑CH<sub>3</sub>CN (<b>3</b>) and [Ni$^{\text{II}}_2$ (HL<sup>1</sup>)<sub>3</sub>($\mu_{1,1}$-NCO)]¬∑2H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>4</b>); Two $\mu_{1,3}$-azide bridged tetranickel(II) compounds [{Ni<sup>II</sup>(L<sup>4</sup>)($\mu_{1,3}$-N<sub>3</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)}<sup>4</sup>] (<b>5</b>) and [{Ni<sup>II</sup>(L<sup>5</sup>)($\mu_{1,3}$-N<sub>3</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)}<sub>4</sub>] (<b>6</b>); Two $\mu_{1,3}$-azide/cyanate one-dimensional compounds [Cu<sup>II</sup>L<sup>5</sup>($\mu_{1,3}$-NCO)]$_n$¬∑2ùëõH<sub>2</sub>O (<b>7</b>) and [Cu<sup>II</sup>L<sup>5</sup>($\mu_{1,3}$-N<sub>3</sub>)]$_n$¬∑2ùëõH<sub>2</sub>O (<b>8</b>). Except compound 5 which shows overall antiferromagnetic coupling, other compounds exhibit overall ferromagnetic interaction. Syntheses, crystal structures, magnetic properties, density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations and experimental/theoretical magneto-structural correlations have been carried out which have revealed some interesting observations on composition/topology, magneto-structural correlations and solid state isomerism. The results have been already published. The present report deals with a review of the salient and interesting features of these works.</p>

				<title>Metal azides under pressure: An emerging class of high energy density materials</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1391-1398</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal azides are well-known for their explosive properties such as detonation or deflagration. As chemically pure sources of nitrogen, alkali metal azides under high pressure have the ability to form polymeric nitrogen, an ultimate green high energy density material with energy density three times greater than that of known high energetic materials. With this motive, in this present work, we try to address the high-pressure behaviour of LiN<sub>3</sub> and KN<sub>3</sub> by means of density functional calculations. All the calculations are performed with the inclusion of van derWaals interactions at semi empirical level, as these materials are typical molecular solids. We found that both LiN<sub>3</sub> and KN<sub>3</sub> are structurally stable up to the studied pressure range of 60 GPa and 16 GPa, respectively. At ambient conditions both the materials are insulators with a gap of 3.48 eV (LiN<sub>3</sub>) and 4.08 eV (KN<sub>3</sub>) and as pressure increases the band gap decreases and show semiconducting nature at high pressures.We also found that the compressibility of both the crystals is anisotropic which is in good agreement with experiment. Our theoretical study proved that the materials under study may have the ability to form polymeric nitrogen because of the decrease in interazide ion distance and possible overlapping of N atomic orbitals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Unusual transformation of one CaCO<sub>3</sub> phase to another has been reported by the process of dissolution-recrystallization and under the influence of additive. In one case, while metastable vaterite transforms to another metastable phase aragonite by simple refluxing in distilled water, it instead transforms thermodynamically stable phase calcite upon refluxing in its `mother-liquor‚Äô. This is explained by the process of dissolution-recrystallization. In another case, aragonite is preferentially synthesized over calcite in the presence of molten lauric acid as an additive.</p>

				<title>Redundant internal coordinates, compliance constants and non-bonded interactions - some new insights</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0009-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A long standing problem in normal mode analysis is identifying the right internal coordinates given only the cartesian coordinates, the masses of the atoms and the cartesian force constants without using any other additional chemical information. A possible solution is suggested here as drawing the normal modes obtained from the mass weighted cartesian force constant matrix and identifying the correct bonds and angles from the normal mode pictures. If chosen properly, the internal coordinates will have minimum mixing in the normal mode representation. This can in principle lead to an automation algorithm. A complete basis of internal coordinates is defined as the minimum number of valence internal coordinates that describe all the normal modes as completely as possible. It was shown in the literature that the relaxed force constants could be used as a measure of bond order in all atom-atom distance coordinates. Some of the bonded and non-bonded atom pairs can have similar values of the relaxed force constants and hence to use the relaxed force constant as a measure of bond order we need to separate the bonded pairs from the non-bonded ones. This needs extra chemical information of which pairs are bonded. The new definition of complete basis of non-redundant valence internal coordinates helps to identify the bonded pairs effectively without extra information. The hydrogen bonded water clusters (H<sub>2</sub>O)$_n$, n = 2-6, methane dimer and methane-water complex are used as examples to verify that the relaxed force constants of bonded pairs are indeed a measure of bond order.</p>

The complexes exhibit broad and intense metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition bands in the visible region (400-700 nm), and red light emitting properties at room temperature. By comparison however, complexes <b>C1</b> and <b>C2</b> bipyridine moiety gave lower molar absorptivity coefficient at relatively similar wavelength characteristics (410-520 nm) when compared to <b>C3</b> and <b>C4</b> with phenanthroline based molecules. Cyclic voltammograms of the complexes revealed complex <b>C4</b> with most reduction potential which might be due to increase in the conjugation of the anthracene functionalized units. Preliminary investigation of the solar cell efficiency of the complexes on TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystalline films gave the best result with efficiency of 0.103&#37; for <b>C1</b> under illumination at 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> AM 1.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique however, revealed the charge transfer resistances (R<sub>ct</sub>) of the electrons on the TiO<sub>2</sub> semiconductor.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this communication, we report the synthesis of three newly designed fluorescent polymers <b>P1-P3</b>, starting from simple thiophene derivatives through precursor polyhydrazide route. The new polymers, carrying donor and acceptor heterocyclic moieties with different spacer groups were found to be thermally stable and good of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with two photon absorption property. The structures of newly synthesized monomers and polymers were confirmed by FTIR, NMR spectral and elemental analyses. Further, polymers were characterized by GPC and TGA studies. Their linear optical and electrochemical properties were evaluated by UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopic and cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies, respectively, whereas their NLO properties were studied by Z-scan technique using Nd: YAG laser at 532 nm with 7 ns pulse. The electrochemical band gap of <b>P1-P3</b> was determined to be 1.98, 1.91 and 2.05 eV, respectively. The NLO results reveal that polymers <b>P1-P3</b> show good optical limiting property with TPA coefficient values $2.9 \times  10^{‚àí11}$ m/W, $8.0 \times 10^{‚àí11}$ m/W and $1.4 \times 10^{‚àí11}$ m/W, respectively.</p>

				<title>Structural and catalytic properties of a novel vanadium containing solid core mesoporous silica shell catalysts for gas phase oxidation reaction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel vanadium containing solid core mesoporous silica shell catalyst was synthesized with different Si/V ratios by sol-gel method under neutral conditions. The synthesized materials were characterized by various techniques and gas phase diphenyl methane oxidation reaction. The mesoporosity combined with microporosity are formed by incorporation of octadecyltrichloro silane and triethylamine in the catalyst and it was found out from E-DAX and BET‚Äîsurface area analysis. The material was found to be nanocrystalline. Vanadium is present as V<sup>4+</sup> species in as-synthesized samples and convert to V$^{5+}$ on calcination. Most of the vanadium is present in tetrahedral or square pyramidal environment. Incorporation of vanadium in silica framework was confirmed by <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR analysis. Among the various vanadium containing solid core mesoporous silica shell catalysts, the Si/V =100 ratio exhibited maximum efficiency towards diphenyl methane to benzophenone gas phase reaction. The optimum condition required for maximum conversion and selectivity was found out from the catalytic studies.</p>

					<p>An efficient process has been developed for the synthesis of propargylamines <i>via</i> a threecomponent coupling reaction of aldehyde, secondary alicyclic amine and alkyne (A<sup>3</sup>) under solvent-free condition using lithium triflate (LiOTf) as expeditious reusable catalyst. This one-pot transformation generates one C-C and one C-N bond, which presumably proceeds by lithium acetylide as well as formation of iminium ion <i>in situ</i> and then undergoes nucleophilic addition to the iminium ion to give the propargyl amine. The solventfree condition, easy recovery of the catalyst, simple, user-friendly and quantitative yield in short time renders the protocol economic and reasonable.</p>

				<title>New bispyrazoline derivatives built around aliphatic chains: Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial studies</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0117-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The bispyrazolines <b>3a-3h</b> built around the alkyl chains of varying lengths have been synthesized from the cyclization reactions of bischalcones with phenyl hydrazine. The bischalcones <b>2a-2h</b> were obtained from the Claisen-Schmidt reactions of acetophenone with various bisaldehydes <b>1a-1h</b>. The intermediate bischalcones and final bisheterocyclic compounds have been characterized by means of IR, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, Mass (ESI) and elemental analysis. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized compounds were also evaluated against the <i>Klubsellia pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillius subtilis and Aspergillius janus, Aspergillus niger and Pencillium glabrum</i>, respectively. The antimicrobial behaviour of the bispyrazolines <b>3a-3h</b> is found to be dependent on the length of internal spacer unit.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of 4-(1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl)-2-phenylnaphtho[1,2-ùëë][1,3]oxazole derivatives have been synthesized from intermediate 1-amino-3-(1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl)naphthalen-2-ol. This intermediate was obtained by coupling 3-(1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl)naphthalen-2-ol with 4-sulphobenzenediazonium chloride followed by reduction with sodium dithionate in water at pH 8-9. 3-(1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl)naphthalen-2-ol was synthesized from 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid and 2-amino phenol in the presence of PCl3 in chlorobenzene at 130-135&#176;C. All these compounds were characterized by FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The synthesized compounds are fluorescent which absorbs in the range of 296 to 332 nm while emits in the ranges of 368 to 404 nm with excellent quantum yield. All compounds were evaluated for <i>in vitro</i> antibacterial activities against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> strains and <i>in vitro</i> antifungal activity against <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Aspergillus niger</i> strains by using serial dilution method.</p>

					<p>The steroidal alkaloid 3ùõΩ, 20ùõº-diamino-pregn-5-ene (kurchamine) obtained from the stem bark of Holarrhena antidysenterica is reported to have appreciable amoebicidal activity. Its three stereoisomers namely 3ùõº, 20ùõΩ-diamino-pregn-5-ene, 3ùõΩ,20ùõΩ-diamino-pregn-5-ene and 3ùõº, 20ùõº-diamino-pregn-5-ene and their intermediate stereoisomeric monoamino pregnene alkaloids namely 3ùõΩ-amino-pregn-5-ene-20-one, 3ùõº-aminopregn-5-ene-20-one, 20ùõº-amino-pregn-5-ene-3ùõΩ-ol, 20ùõΩ-amino-pregn-5-ene-3ùõΩ-ol were synthesized. The natural stereoisomer and synthesized diamino and monoamino stereoisomers were N-methylated and all the compounds were evaluated for amoebicidal activity comparison. The natural stereoisomer 3ùõΩ,20ùõº-diamino-pregn-5-ene (kurchamine) was found to be superior than other stereoisomers and N-methylation was found to have insignificant effect on amoebicidal activity of stereoisomers.</p>

				<title>Preparation of amphiphilic block copolymer containing triazene moieties and fluorescence study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0193-0202</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study describes the synthesis via microwave accelerated reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of an amphiphilic block copolymer <i>poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(dodecylacrylamide-co-1-(phenyl)-3-(2-methacryloyloxyethyl carbamoyloxyethyl)-3-methyltriazene-1) [PAA-b-(PDA-co-PUMA-T)]</i>. The structure and the chemical composition of the block copolymer were confirmed by spectral/thermal analysis. The photoreactivity of the triazene sequences from <i>PAA-b-(PDA-co-PUMA-T)</i> was quantified by UV/vis irradiation in chloroform/dimethylformamide solutions and in thin film, indicating that the solvent polarity modifies with an order of magnitude the rate constant values. The lower rate constant in film state ($kfilm = 1.3 \times 10^{‚àí3}$ s<sup>-1</sup>), shows that the higher mobility of polymeric chains in solution allow a more rapid orientation, favourable to the triazene bond cleavage. The capability of block copolymer to form micelles in aqueous environment and implicitly, its critical micelle concentration (CMC) was evidenced through fluorescence measurements using pyrene probe (10<sup>-6</sup> M), the CMC value being of $4.64 \times  10^{‚àí3}$ g L<sup>-1</sup> PAA-ùëè-(PDA-$co$-PUMA-T) ($3.27 \times 10^{‚àí7}$ M). Experiments of fluorescence quenching with various metal cations (UO$^{2+}_2$, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Hg<sup>2+</sup>) suggested that such a block copolymer could find applications as fluorescence-based chemosensor for the detection of iron cations in homogeneous organic solutions or aqueous environments by thin films.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0203-0211</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Four new thermally stable and optically active poly(amide-imide)s (PAI)s with good inherent viscosities were synthesized from the direct polycondensation reaction of N,N'-(pyromellitoyl)-<i>bis</i>-L-ùõº-amino acids with 3,5-diamino-N-(3,4-dihydroxy-phen-ethyl)benzamide in a medium consisting of a molten salt, tetrabutylammonium bromide, and triphenyl phosphite as the activator. The polymerization reactions produced a series of novel PAIs containing dopamine segment in the side chain in high yield with inherent viscosities between 0.33 and 0.49 dL/g. The obtained polymers were typically characterized by means of FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses, powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electronmicroscopy, inherent viscosity, and solubility tests. Thermal properties and flame retardant behaviour of the PAIs were also investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA and DTG) and limiting oxygen index (LOI). Data obtained by thermal analysis revealed that these polymers showed good thermal stability. Furthermore, high char yield in TGA and good LOI values indicated that the obtained polymers were capable of exhibiting good flame retardant properties.</p>

Spread films of these organizates suggest that there is no expulsion of individual particles or particle assemblies at the interface and the particles are stable. Dynamic surface tension and the associated dilational and shear visco-elasticity in these films suggest that the capsules are highly elastic. Multilayer films of the capsules using Langmuir-Blodgett technique have been fabricated by sequential deposition on solid surfaces. These films have been characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and Fourier transform infrared with reflection absorption spectroscopy (FTIR-RAS). No appreciable change in the secondary structural features of Hb is seen from CD studies indicating the stability of the protein in these organized assemblies. Sizes of these capsules change near the isoelectric point and large swollen multiwalled capsules are formed. The elastic films of capsules of Hb provide a useful post preparation approach for modification of the surface roughness, porosity, and permeability of pre-assembled polypeptide microcapsules.</p>

				<title>Role of ùëÅ-methyl-8-(alkoxy)quinolinium iodide in suppression of protein-protein interactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0229-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a great deal of interest in developing small molecule inhibitors of protein misfolding and aggregation due to a growing number of pathologic states known as amyloid disorders. In searching for alternative ways to reduce protein-protein interactions or to inhibit the amyloid formation, the inhibitory effects of cationic amphiphile viz. ùëÅ-methyl-8-(alkoxy)quinolinium iodide on aggregation behaviour of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) at alkaline pH has been studied. Even though the compounds did not protect native HEWL from conformational changes, they were effective in diminishing HEWL amyloid formation, delaying both nucleation and elongation phases. It is likely that strong binding in the HEWL compound complex, raises the activation energy barrier for protein misfolding and subsequent aggregation, thereby retarding the aggregation kinetics substantially.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Our recent work on charge transfer in the electronically push-pull dimethylaminoazobenzene-fullerene C<sub>60</sub> donor-bridge-acceptor dyad through orbital picture revealed charge displacement from the n$_{\text{(N=N)}}$ (non-bonding) and $\pi_{\text{(N=N)}}$ type orbitals centred on the donor part to the purely fullerene centred LUMOs and (LUMO+n) orbitals, delocalized over the entire molecule. Consequently, this investigation centres around the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters involved in the solvent polarity dependent intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer processes in the dyad, indispensable for artificial photosynthetic systems. A quasi-reversible electron transfer pathway was elucidated with electrode-specific heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants.</p>

				<title>Thiophene-based donor-acceptor conjugated polymer as potential optoelectronic and photonic material</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0247-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of a donor-acceptor conjugated polymer, <b>PTh-CN</b>, containing 3,4-didodecyloxythiophene and cyanovinylene units. The polymer possesses a low band gap of 1.75 eV as calculated from the onset absorption edge. From the electrochemical study, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer are figured out to be ‚àí5.52 eV and ‚àí3.52 eV, respectively. Polymer light-emitting diodes are fabricated using <b>PTh-CN</b> as the emissive layer with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/<b>PTh-CN</b>/Al. The device showed stable saturated red electroluminescence with CIE coordinate values (0.65, 0.32) at 12 V, which are very close to the values for standard red demanded by the NTSC. In addition, the device showed good colour stability under different bias voltages and the threshold voltage of the PLED device is found to be as low as 3.1 V. Further, a nanocomposite of the polymer and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles is prepared by the dispersion method. The nonlinear optical properties of <b>PTh-CN</b> and <b>PTh-CN/TiO<sub>2</sub></b> nanocomposite are studied using z-scan technique. The polymer solution, polymer film and polymer/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite film show a strong saturable absorption behaviour. The value of saturation intensity (<b>I<sub>s</sub></b>) is found to be of the order 10<sup>11</sup>-10<sup>12</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>, indicating that the materials are useful candidates for photonic applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have designed and synthesized donor-acceptor conjugates having donor pyrene at the pyrrole-ùõΩ position of either free-base porphyrin or Zn(II) porphyrin using vinylene spacer. Both the dyads have been completely characterized by elemental analysis,MALDI-MS, UV-Vis., and fluorescence (steady state and timeresolved) spectroscopies as well as cyclic voltammetry. The absorption maxima of both dyads are red-shifted by 8-12 nm. The ground state properties showed that there exist minimum ùúã-ùúã interaction between the aromatic subunits of these D-A systems. Quenched emission was observed in both the dyads when excited at 290 nm. The quenched emission explained in terms of intramolecular excitation energy transfer competes with the photo-induced electron transfer reaction in these D-A system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electrochemistry of cytochrome c (Cyt-c) wired on an electrode modified with the self-assemblies of 4,4'-dithio-dibutyric acid (DTB) and 2-pyrazineethane thiol (PET) by covalent and electrostatic binding and the amperometric sensing of superoxide (O$^‚àí_2$) are described. Cyt-c wired on the mixed self-assembly of DTB and PET displays well-defined voltammetric response at 0.025V with a peak-to-peak separation ($\Delta E_p$) of 5mV. Pyrazine unit in the mixed self-assembly promotes the electron transfer in the redox reaction of surface wired Cyt-c. Cyt-c wired on the mixed self-assembly has been used for the amperometric sensing of superoxide. The enzymatically generated superoxide has been successfully detected using the Cyt-c wired electrode. High sensitivity and fast response for superoxide have been achieved. Uric acid does not interfere in the amperometric measurement of superoxide. The interference due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been eliminated by using enzyme catalase.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0283-0289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The preparation and electrochemical performance of the carbon nanotube paste electrode modified with ferrocene (FCMCNPE) was investigated for electrocatalytic behaviour toward oxidation of ùëÅ-acetyl-ùêø-cysteine (NAC) in the presence of tryptophan (Trp) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The results showed an efficient electrocatalytic activity of FCMCNPE toward oxidation of NAC and Trp, as the electrooxidation of NAC and Trp together gave two well-defined anodic peaks, revealing the applicability of this modified electrode for simultaneous voltammetric detection of mentioned compounds in the same solution. The values of catalytic rate constant (ùëò) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (D<sub>app</sub>) were also calculated using chronoamperometry. The DPV method was applied as a sensitive method for the quantitative detection of trace amounts of NAC and Trp. A linear dynamic range from 1.0 to 18.0 ùúáM for NAC and 2.0 to 150.0 ùúáM for Trp was obtained using DPV method in pH 7.00 buffered solution and the detection limit (3ùúé) was determined as 0.49 ùúáM and 0.54 ùúáM for NAC and Trp, respectively. The proposed method was also applied for analysis of NAC tablet, investigating the applicability of the proposed voltammetric method for determination of NAC in real sample.</p>

				<title>Modified calcium oxide as stable solid base catalyst for Aldol condensation reaction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0313-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A highly efficient and stable solid-base catalyst for Aldol condensation was prepared by modifying commercial CaO with benzyl bromide in a simple way. It was found that modified CaO can effectively catalyse the Aldol condensation of cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, as well as various benzaldehydes, to produce 2-benzylidenecyclohexanone with a good selectivity and high yield. Higher yield of 95.8&#37; was obtained over modified CaO after 3 h, which is short compared with the yield of 92.1&#37; after 12 h over commercial CaO. The influence of several reaction parameters, such as temperature, catalyst loading, was investigated. The humidity test over modified CaO reveals that the basic centres of modified CaO are stable for CO<sub>2</sub> and moisture. From the results of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) and Thermogravity analysis (TG) characterization, the modifier was bonded on surface of CaO chemically and almost no Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> formed during the modification process. The type of aldehyde has great influence on the yield of aldol condensation.</p>

Three-component condensation reactions of ùõΩ-naphthol with aromatic or aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of these catalysts were investigated. These reactions were studied under different conditions such as solvent-free media using both conventional heating and microwave irradiation and also several solvents.

				<title>Isomerization of propargyl cation to cyclopropenyl cation: Mechanistic elucidations and effects of lone pair donors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0365-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This <i>ab initio</i> study examines two pathways (one concerted and the other two-step) for isomerization of the linear propargyl cation to the aromatic cyclopropenyl cation, also probing the phenomenon of solvation of this reaction by simple lone pair donors (NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>S and HF) which bind to the substrate at two sites. Fully optimized geometries at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were used, along with single point QCISD(T)/6-311+G(d,p) and accurate G3 level calculations upon the DFT optimized geometries. For the unsolvated reaction, the two-step second pathway is energetically favoured over the one-step first pathway. Lone pair donor affinity for the various C<sub>3</sub>H$^+_3$ species follows the uniform order NH<sub>3</sub> &#62; H<sub>2</sub>S&#62;H<sub>2</sub>O&#62;HF. The activation barriers for the solvated isomerizations decrease in the order HF&#62;H<sub>2</sub>O&#62;H<sub>2</sub>S&#62;NH<sub>3</sub> for both pathways. The number of lone pairs on the donor heteroatom as well as the heteroatom electronegativity are factors related to both these trends. Compared to the unsolvated cases, the solvated reactions have transition states which are usually ‚Äòlater‚Äô in position along the reaction coordinate, validating the Hammond postulate.</p>

				<title>AIM analysis, synthetic, kinetic and mechanistic investigations of the reaction between triphenylphosphine and dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate in the presence of 3-methoxythiophenol</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0387-0399</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Triphenylphosphine reacts with dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates in the presence of 3-methoxythiophenol to generate stable phosphorus ylides. These stable ylides exist in solution as a mixture of two geometrical isomers as a result of restricted rotation around the carbon-carbon partial double bond resulting from conjugation of the ylide moiety with the adjacent carbonyl group. Quantum mechanical calculations were employed to check the stability of the two geometrical isomers in phosphorous ylide by natural population analysis (NPA), atoms in molecules (AIM) methods and CHelpG keyword. To determine the kinetic parameters and mechanistic investigation of the reaction, they were monitored by UV spectrophotometry. The second order fits were automatically drawn, and the value of the second order rate constants ($k_2$) were automatically calculated using standard equations. At the temperature range studied, the dependence of the second order rate constant (ln $k_2$) on reciprocal temperature was in good agreement with the Arrhenius equation. This provided the relevant plots to calculate the activation energy of all the reactions. Furthermore, useful information was obtained from studies of the effect of solvent, structure of reactions (different alkyl groups within the dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates), and also concentration of reactants on the rate of reaction. The proposed mechanism was confirmed according to the obtained experimental results, and a steady state approximation. The first ($k_2$) and third ($k_3$) steps of the reactions were recognized as the rate determining and fast steps, respectively on the basis of experimental data. Also, the activation parameters involving ùõ•G<sup>&#35;</sup>, ùõ•S<sup>&#35;</sup> and ùõ•H<sup>&#35;</sup> were obtained for all the reactions.</p>

				<title>A comparative study between all-electron scalar relativistic calculation and all-electron calculation on the adsorption of hydrogen molecule onto small gold clusters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0401-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative study between all-electron relativistic (AER) calculation and all-electron (AE) calculation on the H<sub>2</sub> molecule adsorption onto small gold clusters has been performed. Compared with the corresponding Au$_n$H<sub>2</sub> cluster obtained by AE method, the Au$_n$H<sub>2</sub> cluster obtained by AER method has much shorter Au-H bond-length, much longer H-H distance, larger binding energy and adsorption energy, higher vertical ionization potentials (VIP), greater charge transfer, higher vibrational frequency of Au-H mode and lower vibrational frequency of H-H mode. The delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for Au$_n$H<sub>2</sub> cluster obtained by AER method is obvious. All these characteristics suggest that the scalar relativistic effect might strengthen the Au-H bond and weaken the H-H bond. It is believed that the scalar relativistic effect is favourable to the H<sub>2</sub> molecule adsorption onto small gold cluster and the reactivity enhancement of H<sub>2</sub> molecule. It may be one of the reasons why the dissociative adsorptions take place in some Au$_n$H<sub>2</sub> clusters. With increasing size of Au$_n$H<sub>2</sub> clusters, the influence of scalar relativistic effect becomes more significant. Some further studies focused on the influence of scalar relativistic effect on the adsorption behaviour of other small molecules onto gold clusters are necessary in the future.</p>

				<title>Computational and experimental studies on oxalic acid imprinted polymer</title>

				<page>0413-0418</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Computational approach plays an important role to pre-evaluate the interactions between template and functional monomer, so that to choose functional monomer having stronger interactions with template during synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Hence template-monomer interactions in pre-polymerization were mainly focused. In this paper, computational chemistry was applied to screen the number of mol of functional monomer that interacts with one mol of template. Intermolecular interactions between oxalic acid and acrylamide have been investigated. The binding energies ùõ•E<sub>bind</sub> were calculated by DFT (B3LYP) level of theory with the 6‚àí31+G(d,p) basis set. It was found that four mol of acrylamide were sufficient to interact with one mol of oxalic acid in the pre-polymerization mixture. Four possible conformations and frequency calculations were performed to locate minima. Oxalic acid specific bulk polymer was obtained by the thermal initiated free radical co-polymerization of acrylamide and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate with oxalic acid as template and acetonitrile as porogen. The synthesized MIP efficiently adsorbed oxalic acid from aqueous solutions. The binding parameters ofMIP and non-imprinted polymer (NIP) were compared by Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms.</p>

Alternant copolymers of maleic anhydride with vinyl acetate and styrene sulphonate sodium acid salt polyelectrolytes were synthesized in aqueous solution and used as stabilizers. The formation of nano silver particles was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and TEM measurements. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurements were needed to study how the reagents and their concentrations influence particle size. SEM images show the nanostructure of the hybrid films and indicate a strong interaction between the polyelectrolyte and the silver NPs. Moreover, the silver NPs could be stored for one year without observation of aggregates or sedimentation. The final solid products obtained after evaporating to dryness can be used to produce stable dispersions upon mixing with water. Few of the final products were found to exhibit a high antibacterial and antifungal activity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report here a simple and effective approach to the covalent attachment of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and azo compounds. The functionalized SWCNTs prepared (through a radical mechanism) have been used for a diazonium coupling reaction. The results showed that the chemical method used has improved the processability and solubility of the carbon nanotubes. The dark brown SWCNTs obtained which can produce a yellow colour in organic solvents were characterized by different spectroscopic analyses. Heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra (<sup>13</sup>C-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC) have been used to detect the carbon nanotube allylic protons. The morphology of the main product has been shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p>

				<page>0443-0465</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The properties of aminophosphonates as transition state analogs of amino acids, and as antibacterial, antifungal and antiHIV agents attracted considerable attention in recent years. Although many reviews appeared in the literature covering ùõº- and ùõΩ-aminophosphonates, ùõæ-aminophosphonates did not receive sufficient attention despite the fact that parent ùõæ-aminophosphonic acid and its derivatives are bio-isosteric analogs of GABA (ùõæ-amino butyric acid). This review provides a critical summary of the significance of ùõæ-aminophosphonates and various approaches to their synthesis, with particular emphasis to asymmetric versions.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0483-0493</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, both <i>classification</i> and <i>correlation</i> approaches have been successfully employed for development of models for the prediction of CDK4 inhibitory activity using a dataset comprising of 52 analogues of 4-aminomethylene isoquinoline-1,3-(2ùêª,4ùêª)-dione. Decision tree, random forest, moving average analysis (MAA), multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least square regression (PLSR) and principal component regression (PCR) were used to develop models for prediction of CDK4 inhibitory activity. The statistical significance of models was assessed through specificity, sensitivity, overall accuracy, Mathew‚Äôs correlation coefficient (MCC), cross validated correlation coefficient, ùêπ test, $r^2$ for external test set (pred_$r^2$), coefficient of correlation of predicted dataset (pred$_-$r<sup>2</sup>Se) and intercorrelation analysis. High accuracy of prediction offers proposed models a vast potential for providing lead structures for the development of potent therapeutic agents for CDK4 inhibition.</p>

					<p>Syntheses of 3-(phenyl)-benzo[b]thiophene [2, 3-d][1,2] benzodiazocine derivatives have been accomplished by the reaction of 3-phenacylidine-2-benzo[b]thiophene-2-ones with o-phenylene diamine. The photolytic reaction with <i>trans</i>-stilbene resulted in the exclusive formation of spiro{2',5',6'-triphenyl-2H-pyran-4',3}-benzo[b]thiophene-2-one derivatives. Theoretical calculations have been performed to study the mechanism and stereoselectivity of products. Good yield and broad scope of usable substrates of industrial relevance are other prominent features of the present methodologies.</p>

				<title>Efficient acetylation of primary amines and amino acids in environmentally benign brine solution using acetyl chloride</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0607-0613</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Acetyl chloride is one of the most commonly available and cheap acylating agent but its high reactivity and concomitant instability in water precludes its use to carry out acetylation in aqueous medium. The present methodology illustrates the efficient acetylation of primary amines and amino acids in brine solution by means of acetyl chloride under weakly basic condition in the presence of sodium acetate and/or triethyl amine followed by trituration with aqueous saturated bicarbonate solution. This effort represents the first efficient use of this most reactive but cheap acetylating agent to acetylate amines in excellent yields in aqueous medium. This is a potentially useful green chemical transformation where reaction takes place in environment-friendly brine solution leading to easy work-up and isolation of the amide derivatives. Mechanistic rationale of this methodology is also important.</p>

				<title>The effects of urea, guanidinium chloride and sorbitol on porphyrin aggregation: Molecular dynamics simulation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0627-0641</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper compares the inhibition effect of porphyrin aggregation in the presence of urea, guanidinium chloride (Gdn) and sorbitol by molecular dynamics simulation. It demonstrates that porphyrin aggregation increases in sorbitol, but decreases towards addition of urea and Gdn. It shows that urea, Gdn and sorbitol can have a large effect ‚Äî positive or negative, depending on the concentration ‚Äî on the aggregation of the porphyrin. The effect of urea, Gdn and sorbitol on porphyrin aggregation has been inferred from the effect of these solutes on the hydration layer of porphyrin. It appears that the Gdn is more suitable than urea for decreasing the hydration layer of porphyrin while several osmolites like sorbitol are known to increase hydration layer and thus might stabilize the porphyrin aggregation. Results of radial distribution function (RDF), distributed atoms or molecules around target species, indicated that the increase and exclusion of solvent around porphyrin by osmolytes and Gdn would affect significantly on porphyrin aggregation. There was a sizeable difference in potency between the Gdn and urea, with the urea being less potent to decrease hydration layer and porphyrin aggregation.</p>

Two consecutive reaction steps were observed for the substitution process with L-methionine. For the substitution with thiourea, a third reaction step, the displacement of the labilized amine, as a result of the strong <i>trans</i>-effect of thiourea ligand was observed. <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopy was used to follow the substitution of the ligand by thiourea. The activation parameters for all reactions studied suggest an associative substitution mechanism.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, crystal structure and photo luminescent property of a 3D metal-organic hybrid of Cd(II) constructed by two different bridging carboxylate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0661-0666</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A solvothermal reaction of cadmium (II) nitrate with succinic acid and isonicotinic acid creates a novel 3D metal-organic framework, [Cd<sub>3</sub>(isonicotinate)<sub>2</sub>(suc)<sub>2</sub>]$_n$(<b>1</b>). Single crystal X-ray structure determination reveals that complex <b>1</b> posses two crystallographically independent Cd(II) centres. The succinate anion acts here as a heptadented ligand and binds five Cd(II) centre simultaneously. The heptacoordinated Cd(II) centres are oxo-bridged by succinate moiety and the hexacoordinated metal centres are terminally connected through four different succinate moiety to make the overall 2D sheet arrangement. In unit cell, the ratio of hexadented Cd(II) and heptadented Cd(II) is 1:2. The new compound was also characterized by luminescence spectra and compared with the luminescence spectra of the pure isonicotinic acid.</p>

Their magnetic properties exhibited a marked dependence on Fe/Cr content, with significant reduction of the magnetic moment per formula unit and their Curie temperatures. In addition, the magnetocaloric effect, determined by isothermal magnetization measurements, displayed a decreasing tendency with increasing Fe/Cr concentration. Results were interpreted on the basis of a deleterious effect on the double exchange interaction provoked by the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions within the crystal structure.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0673-0678</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The decomposition of mixture of selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been studied in a catalytic non-thermal plasma dielectric barrier discharge reactor. The VOCs mixture consisting n-hexane, cyclo-hexane and ùëù-xylene was chosen for the present study. The decomposition characteristics of mixture of VOCs by the DBD reactor with inner electrode modified with metal oxides of Mn and Co was studied. The results indicated that the order of the removal efficiency of VOCs followed as ùëù-xylene &#62; cyclo-hexane &#62; ùëõ-hexane. Among the catalytic study, MnOx/SMF (manganese oxide on sintered metal fibres electrode) shows better performance, probably due to the formation of active oxygen species by <i>in situ</i> decomposition of ozone on the catalyst surface. Water vapour further enhanced the performance due to the <i>in situ</i> formation of OH radicals.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were used to study the effects of Cu and Ca promotion on Fe-Zn-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. The reduction temperature for Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ‚Üí Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was unaffected by Ca addition but decreased when promoted with Cu. Fe-Zn promoted with Cu and Ca showed even much lower reduction temperature for Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>‚ÜíFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Ca promotion enhances carburization and increases surface acidity and basicity of the Fe-Zn oxide precursor. While Cu inhibits carburization and decreases the surface acidity and basicity of the Fe-Zn oxide precursor. The implications of these effects on the application of catalysts for FT are discussed.</p>

				<title>Revisiting the electrochemical impedance behaviour of the LiFePO<sub>4</sub>/C cathode</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0687-0693</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, the electrochemical behaviour of LiFePO4/C electrode has been reported. Specially, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) have been studied in detail. The discharge capacity is more than 120 mAh/g. There are two semicircles being found in the Nyquist plot for the cycled electrode and one semicircle for the as-prepared electrode. It is found that the interface capacitance is in an order of magnitude of 10 ùúáF/cm<sup>2</sup> for the high-frequency semicircle, while for the second semicircle the interface capacitance is $5.3 \tilde  45.4 \times  10^3$ ùúáF/cm<sup>2</sup>. It could be concluded that the high-frequency semicircle is to correspond to the charge transfer process. The function of the carbon layer is also briefly discussed.</p>

				<title>NO<sub>2</sub>-induced synthesis of nitrato-iron(III) porphyrin with diverse coordination mode and the formation of isoporphyrin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0707-0714</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two nitrato-iron(III) porphyrinates [Fe(4-Me-TPP)(NO<sub>3</sub>)] <b>1</b> and [Fe(4-OMe-TPP)(NO<sub>3</sub>)] <b>2</b> are reported. Interestingly, [Fe(4-Me-TPP)(NO<sub>3</sub>)] <b>1</b> has nitrate ion coordinated as monodentate (by single oxygen atom), while [Fe(4-OMe-TPP)(NO<sub>3</sub>)] <b>2</b> has nitrate coordination through bidentate mode. Compound <b>1</b> was found serendipitously in the reaction of [Fe(4-Me-TPP)Cl] with nitrous acid, which was performed for the synthesis of nitro-iron(III) porphyrin, [Fe(4-Me-TPP)NO<sub>2</sub>]. The compound <b>2</b> was synthesized by passing NO<sub>2</sub> gas through a solution of [Fe(4-OMe-TPP)]<sub>2</sub>O. Upon passing NO<sub>2</sub> gas through a solution of a ùúá-oxo-dimer, [Fe(4-Me-TPP)]<sub>2</sub>O also produces <b>1</b>. It is interesting that in more electron-rich porphyrin <b>2</b>, binding of the nitrate in a symmetrical bidentate way while in less electron-rich porphyrin <b>1</b>, binding of the anion is unidentate by a terminal oxygen atom. However, it is expected that the energy difference between the monodentate and bidentate coordination mode is very small and the interchange between these coordination is possible. Upon passing NO<sub>2</sub> gas through a solution of ùúá-oxo-dimeric iron(III) porphyrin, the nitrato-iron(III) porphyrin forms first, that later gets oxidized to ùúã-cation radical to yield hydroxy-isoporphyrin in the presence of trace amount of water. These nitrato-iron(III) porphyrinates in moist air slowly converted back to their respective ùúá-oxo-dimeric iron(III) porphyrins.</p>

The arrangements of L and tp suggest a gap around the metal centre due to occupation of a stereo-active lone pair of electrons reflecting a hemidirected coordination around the metal centre. The complexes exhibit reasonable thermal stabilities with the tolerate temperatures ca. 255&#176;C for <b>1</b> and 263&#176;C for <b>2</b>.

Twelve polyphenols including 8-demethyl eucalyptin (<b>1</b>), eucalyptin (<b>2</b>), myrciaphenone A (<b>3</b>), myrciaphenone B (<b>4</b>), quercetin-3-ùëÇ-ùõΩ-D-xylopyranoside (<b>5</b>), myricetin-3-ùëÇ-ùõº-L-rhamnopyranoside (<b>6</b>), quercetin-3-ùëÇ-ùõΩ-D-galactopyranoside (<b>7</b>), quercetin-3-ùëÇ-ùõΩ-D-glucopyranoside (<b>8</b>), quercetin-3-ùëÇ-ùõº-L-rhamnopyranoside (<b>9</b>), syringic acid (<b>10</b>), gallic acid-3-methyl ether (<b>11</b>), gallic acid-4-methyl ether (<b>12</b>) and gallic acid (<b>13</b>) were isolated from the active extracts. All the tested compounds except 8-demethyleucalyptin and myrciaphenone B showed strong to moderate (6.9-24.5 ùúáM) antileishmanial activity against <i>Leishmania donovani</i> promastigotes. An HPLC-PDA method has been developed to detect/quantify 29 compounds in the extracts of <i>C. maculata</i> leaves. This validated method allows simultaneous quantitation of seven flavonoids, fourteen phloroglucinols and eight other polyphenols and can be applied for qualitative as well as quantitative determination of phytoconstituents in <i>Eucalyptus matrices</i>.</p>

					<p>The reaction of ùëÅ-methyl-4-(methylthio)-3-nitro-4ùêª-chromen-2-amine and its derivatives with 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2ùêª-pyran-2-one in EtOH reflux for 5 min furnish 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-(2-(methylamino)-3-nitro-4ùêª-chromen-4-yl)-2ùêª-pyran-2-ones in quantitative yield. By extending EtOH reflux for 2 h, the 4ùêª-chromene 4-hydroxy-2-pyranone conjugates get converted into acetoacetyl coumarins. Similar reaction of ùëÅ-methyl-4-(methylthio)-3-nitro-4ùêª-chromen-2-amine and its derivatives with 4-hydroxycoumarin in EtOH reflux furnish 4-hydroxy-2'-(methylamino)-3'-nitro-2ùêª,4'ùêª-3,4'-bichromen-2-ones. In contrast to earlier system, prolonging reflux in EtOH or in ùëõ-PrOH reflux the product gets transformed into <i>trans</i>-ethyl 3-(2-hydroxyaryl)-4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2ùêª-furo[3,2-c]chromene-2-carboxylates. Thus, facile synthesis and characterization of 4ùêª-chromene 4-hydroxy-2-pyrone, 4ùêª-chromene 4-hydroxycoumarin conjugates, acetoacetyl coumarins and <i>trans</i>2,3-disubstituted dihydrofuro[3,2-c]coumarins is described.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) was synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization. Au-loaded TS-1 (Au/TS-1) was prepared by the photo-deposition method. The prepared photocatalysts have been fully characterized by Raman, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet visible light spectroscopy to reveal their structure, surface morphology and chemical composition. Photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts was ascertained by gas phase photo-epoxidation of propylene-to-propylene oxide in the presence of molecular oxygen only under light irradiation. No sacrificial reductant such as hydrogen was used during the photoreaction. Au/TS-1 photocatalyst remained highly stable under reaction conditions. It is found that the increased Ti<sup>3+</sup> sites due to the incorporation of Au will not only enhance the selectivity of the photocatalyst to form epoxide but also its stability during C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> conversion.</p>

				<page>0875-0882</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reverse micelles (RMs) of sodium 1,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulphosuccinate (AOT) in nonpolar organic solvents are widely known to have very high solubilization power for water. The method is applied to the hydrolysis of ùëù-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) catalysed by ùõº-chymotrypsin (ùõº-CT) in AOT/isooctane/buffer RMs. The increase in ùõº-CT activity and stability was an optimum at wo ([H<sub>2</sub>O]/[AOT]) = 10, z [Isooctane]/[AOT]) = 5. Three typical surfactants were selected based on their head group charges: a non-ionic surfactant Triton-X 100 and two zwitterionic sulphobetaine surfactants of the type C$_n$H$_{2n+1}$N<sup>+</sup>Me<sub>2</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> SO$^‚àí_3$ (n = 10; SB3-10, n = 16; SB3-16). The kinetic parameters (such as $k_{\text{cat}}$ and $K_M$) of the ùõº-CT at 27&#176;C were determined and compared in the absence and presence of three surfactants. The effect of chain length of zwitterionic surfactant (SB3-10 and SB3-16) on the enzymatic efficacy of ùõº-CT as a function of mixed surfactant addition has been investigated in AOT/isooctane RMs at pH 7.75.</p>

				<title>Molecular aggregation, solvato- and acidochromic properties of symmetrical ketocyanines</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0883-0894</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The absorption and fluorescence spectral characteristics of some symmetrical ketocyanine dyes have been investigated in different solvents of various polarities using steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopic techniques. The absorption spectral features are less sensitive to the solvent characteristics than the corresponding fluorescence spectra. A large excited state dipole moment parallel to the smaller ground state dipole moment was calculated. The large dipole moment change with the strongly solvatofluorochromic behaviour, as the solvent polarity increases, demonstrates the formation of an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) excited state, which is confirmed by theoretical calculation using semiempirical PM3 method. Also, the effect of dye concentration on the electronic absorption spectra for the investigated dyes has been studied in ethanol. In addition, the acidochromic behaviour of these dyes has been studied using sulphuric acid at different $H_o$ values. A progressive red-shift in the absorption and emission spectra has been observed upon increasing the concentration of sulphuric acid with dramatic changes in colour. This suggests the design of potential optical sensors for probing acidity of the medium or water content in sulphuric acid. The calculated excited state protonation constants $p K^{\ast}_a$) are lower than $pK_a$ values calculated for the ground state, indicating that the investigated ketocyanines become more basic in the first excited singlet state.</p>

				<page>0905-0912</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inductive effect of methyl group has been quantified by expressing highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and HOMO-1 energies of indole and a series of methylated indoles using a combination of graph theory (GT) and the Coulson-Longuett-Higgins perturbation method. By correlating these expressions with the corresponding Kohn-Sham orbital energies of the indoles obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) and M06-2X/6-31++G(d,p) levels of theory, the inductive effect parameter $h_{Me}$ has been estimated; the Coulomb integral ùõº of ùúã-conjugated carbon atom also comes out from the analysis. A correlation of the GT results with the HOMO and HOMO-1 energies obtained by the HF/STO-3G method yield almost the same values of $h_{Me}$ and ùõº. Finally, when these estimated $h_{Me}$ and ùõº are used to calculate the vertical ionization potentials of the methylated indoles in the series, an excellent correlation with experimental charge transfer transition energies of their molecular complexes with tetracyanoethylene is obtained which complies with Mulliken‚Äôs theory of charge transfer.</p>

				<page>0927-0932</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction paths of hydrogen trioxide (HO<sub>3</sub>) with sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) have been investigated on the doublet potential energy surface, theoretically. All species of the title reaction have been optimized at the PMP2(FC)/cc-pVDZ computational level. Energetic data have been obtained at the CCSD(T)//PMP2 level employing the cc-pVDZ basis set. No stable collision complexes have been found between the SO<sub>2</sub> and HO<sub>3</sub> molecules. Therefore, the SO<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>3</sub> reaction starts without initial associations. The four possible paths, P<sub>1</sub> through P<sub>4</sub>, have been obtained for the formation of SO<sub>3</sub> (D$_{3h}$) + HOO$^{\bullet}$ product. Our results show that these four paths include relatively high energy barriers to produce the final product of the SO<sub>3</sub> (D$_{3h}$) + HOO$^{\bullet}$. Therefore, the SO<sub>2</sub> + HO$_3\to$SO<sub>3</sub>(D$_{3h}$) + HOO$^{\bullet}$ reaction is difficult to perform under atmospheric conditions. This means that the importance of SO<sub>2</sub> + HO$_3 \to$ SO<sub>3</sub> (D$_{3h}$) + HOO$^{\bullet}$ reaction increases with increasing temperature and, this reaction plays an important role in the SO<sub>3</sub>(D$_{3h}$) production as the main molecule of the formation of acid rain at high temperatures.</p>

					<p>Intramolecular charge transfer of 4-ùëÅ,ùëÅ-dimethylamino cinnamaldehyde (DMACA) in vacuum and in five different aprotic solvents has been studied by using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Polarizable continuum model (PCM) was employed to consider solvent-solute interactions. The potential energy curves were constructed at different torsional angle of ùëÅ,ùëÅ-dimethylamino moiety with respect to the adjacent phenyl ring. A large bathochromic shift in our calculated emission and absorption energies for polar solvents is a clear reminiscent of charge transfer nature of the excited state. Finally, the reported results are in agreement with experimental findings.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Intramolecular hydrogen bonding (IHB) of 1-amino-3-imino-prop-1-ene (AIP), as the simplest resonance-assisted hydrogen bond system in symmetric N-H‚Ä¶N class, and its halo derivatives (F, Cl, and Br) have been studied at the DFT-B3LYP/6-311++G$^{\ast\ast}$ level of theory. For better understanding of the nature of substituent effects, nitro and methoxy derivatives of AIP were also added to our consideration. Good linear correlations between IHB energies based on Espinosa‚Äôs equation and $-G(r)/V(r)$ values, total electronic density, Laplacian of total electronic density in critical points, ùúã-electron delocalization parameter (ùëÑ), hyper conjugative interaction energy of lp(N) ‚Üí $\sigma^\ast$(N-H), ($F_{i,j}/S_{i,j}$)<sup>2</sup> parameter, natural charges of bridged hydrogen, frequency shift of the N-H stretching vibration, and chemical shift of bridged hydrogen were obtained.</p>

				<title>Density functional theory, natural bond orbital and quantum theory of atoms in molecule analyses on the hydrogen bonding interactions in tryptophan-water complexes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0949-0958</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tryptophan-water (Trp-H<sub>2</sub>O) complexes formed by hydrogen bonding interactions were investigated at the ùúîB97XD/6-311++G(d,p) level. Five Trp-H<sub>2</sub>O complexes possessing various types of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) were characterized by geometries, energies, vibrational frequencies. The nature of the H-bonds were characterized by the natural bond orbital (NBO) and the quantum theory of atoms in molecule (QTAIM) analyses as well. The intramolecular H-bond formed between the amino and carboxyl oxygen atom of tryptophan was retained in most of the complexes, and the cooperativity between the intra and intermolecular H-bonds exist in some complexes. The intramolecular H-bond and some intermolecular H-bonds are strong and have partial covalent character. The H-bonds formed between carboxyl and oxygen/nitrogen atoms are stronger than other H-bonds. The H-bonds involving methylene of tryptophan as H-donor are weak H-bonds. For all complexes, $\Delta E_{\text{ele}}$ and $\Delta E_{\text{ex}}$ makes major contributions to the total interaction energy ($\Delta E_{\text{MP2}}$), while $\Delta E_{\text{disp}}$ is the smallest component of the interaction energy. Both hydrogen bonding interaction and structural deformation play important roles in the relative stabilities of the complexes. Regardless of strong H-bonds, the stabilities of some complexes are weakened by the serious structural deformations.</p>

The <i>in vivo</i> photoinduced antibacterial activity of all the synthesized compounds has been studied. The unique photo-bioactivity of 5ùêª-indolo[3,2-ùëê]quinolin-6(11ùêª)-one is further studied under the photo-DNA cleavage analysis.

					<p>A simple, green and catalyst-free novel protocol is developed for the synthesis of medicinally important spiro[indole-3,2'[1,3]-thiazine]-2,4'-dione and spiro[acenaphthylene-1,2'-[1,3]thiazine]dione libraries by the tandem reaction of readily available reagents in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [bmim][PF<sub>6</sub>]. The ionic liquid has been used as a solvent as well as catalyst for this reaction. This reaction proceeded smoothly in good to excellent yields and offered several other advantages including short reaction time, simple experimental workup procedure and no by-products. The synthesized compounds were subjected to antimycobacterial efficacy against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> H37Rv strain and DNA cleavage activity.</p>

The rate constant showed an inverse acid dependence on H<sup>+</sup> ion at the pH range 1-1.5. The presence of sulphate retards the reaction. Macrocylic ligand oxidation was followed spectrophotometrically by examining the oxidation of nickel(II) complexes of macrocyclic ligands such as 1,8-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,3,6,8,10,13-hexaazacyclotetradecane (L<sub>2</sub>), ùëöùë†-5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (L<sub>3</sub>), <i>rac</i>-Me<sub>6</sub>[14]-4,11-dieneN<sub>4</sub> (L<sub>4</sub>) by reaction with hydrogen peroxide.

				<abstract>
					<p>The substitution reaction of <i>cis</i>-[Pt(<i>cis</i>-dach)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> (where `dach‚Äô is <i>cis</i>-1,2-diaminocyclohexane) with 2-thiouracil (S, N), 1,2-cyclohexanedionedioxime (N, N) and acetylacetone (O, O) were studied in aqueous solution in 0.10 M NaClO<sub>4</sub> under pseudo-first order conditions as a functions of concentration, pH and temperature using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The substitution reaction proceeds via rapid outer sphere association complex formation, followed by two slow consecutive steps. The first of these involves ligand-assisted deaquation, while second involves chelation as the second aqua ligand is displaced. The association equilibrium constant (K<sub>E</sub>) for the outer sphere complex formation has been evaluated together with rate constants for the two subsequent steps. The rate constants increase with increasing ligand concentration and the evaluated activation parameters for all reactions suggest an associative substitution mechanism for both the aqua ligand substitution processes. The product of the reaction has been characterized by IR, NMR and ESI-MS spectral analysis; which throws more light on the mechanistic behaviour of platinum(II) antitumour complexes.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of electron transfer reaction of ternary dipicolinatochromium(III) complex involving oxalate as secondary ligand</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1151-1159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mechanism of electron transfer reaction of ternary Mechanism of the oxidation of [Cr<sup>III</sup>(DPA)(OX)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>‚àí</sup> (DPA = dipicolinate and OX = oxalate) by periodate in aqueous acidic medium has been studied spectrophotometrically over the pH range of 4.45-5.57 at different temperatures. The reaction is first order with respect to both [IO$^‚àí_4$] and the complex concentration, and it obeys the following rate law: $$d[{\text Cr}^{\text{VI}}]/dt = k_6K_4K_6[{\text IO}^‚àí_4][{\text{Cr}}^{\text{III}}]_{\text{T}}/\{([H^+] + K_4) + (K_5[H+] + K_6K_4)[{\text{IO}}^‚àí_4]\}.$$</p>
					<p>The rate of the reaction increases with increasing pH due to the deprotonation equilibria of the complex. The experimental rate law is consistent with a mechanism in which the deprotonated form [Cr<sup>III</sup>(DPA)(OX)(OH)]<sup>2‚àí</sup> is more reactive than the conjugated acid. It is proposed that electron transfer proceeds through an inner-sphere mechanism <i>via</i> coordination of IO$^‚àí_4$ to chromium(III). Thermodynamic activation parameters were calculated using the transition state theory equation.dipicolinatochromium(III) complex involving oxalate as secondary ligand</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Multiwalled carbon nanotubes doped with boron and nitrogen (BCNTs) have been synthesized by chemical vapour deposition at temperatures ranging from 800&#176;C to 950&#176;C. Their morphological and structural features have been studied by transmission electron microscope, which reveal that BCNTs have bamboo-like structure. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the atomic ratio of B, C and N of BCNTs is about 1:4:1, when temperature is 850&#176;C. Electrooxidation performance of the BCNTs for NO at the modified electrodes was investigated. The results of cyclic voltammograms and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of BCNT-modified electrodes indicated that the activity of NO electrooxidation on 850&#176;C-modified electrodes is much stronger than others and the charge transfer resistance of NO electroxidation BCNT-modified electrode is the least. By this means, BCNT-modified electrodes showed excellent electrode materials for NO detection and other potential applications.</p>

				<title>Influence of binder solvent on carbon-layer structure in electrical-double-layer capacitors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1177-1183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Porous activated-carbons with a large surface-area have been the most common materials for electrical-double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). These carbons having a wide pore distribution ranges from micropores to macropores in conjunction with a random pore connection that facilitates the high specific-capacitance values. Pore distribution plays a central role in controlling the capacitance value of EDLCs, since electrolyte distribution inside the active material mainly depends on the pore distribution. This has a direct influence on the distribution of resistance and capacitance values within the electrode. As a result, preparation of electrodes remains a vital issue in realising high-performance EDLCs. Generally, carbon materials along with some binders are dispersed into a solvent and coated onto the current collectors. This study examines the role of binder solvents used for the carbon-ink preparation on the microstructure of the electrodes and the consequent performance of the EDLCs. It is observed that the physical properties of the binder solvent namely its dielectric constant, viscosity and boiling point have important role in determining the pore-size distribution as well as the microstructure of electrodes which influence their specific capacitance values.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a simple and green method has been developed for the synthesis of bisphenolic antioxidants by the reaction of 2-<i>tert</i>-butyl-4-methylphenol and aldehydes in the presence of sulphonated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-SO<sub>3</sub>H) as heterogeneous, robust and reusable catalysts under solventfree conditions. MWCNTs-SO<sub>3</sub>H was prepared and characterized by some microscopic and spectroscopic techniques including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Acidity of the catalyst was measured by acid-base titration. The catalyst was reused several times without efficient loss of its activity for the preparation of bisphenolic antioxidants. In addition, high yields of the products, relatively short reaction times, being solvent-free and non-toxicity of the catalyst are other worthwhile advantages of the present method.</p>

				<page>1197-1205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The oxidation behaviour of a potent anti-Parkinson‚Äôs disease drug ropinirole hydrochloride was investigated over a wide pH range in aqueous solution at glassy carbon electrode using cyclic and square-wave voltammetry. The oxidation of drug is a pH dependent irreversible process and occurs in two steps. The mechanism of the oxidation process has been discussed. Using the sharp oxidation response in 0.1Msulphuric acid at a potential of +1.27V attributed to the oxidation of indol-2-one ring in drug molecule, rapid electroanalytical methods for the determination of ropinirole by pulse voltammetric techniques were developed and validated. The proposed voltammetric methods were applied to direct quantification of ropinirole in film-coated tablets, with results in close agreement (at 95&#37; confidence level) with those obtained using a comparative HPLC method.</p>

					<p>We suggest a control scheme for choosing populations of molecular rotational states by wave packet interference. The rotational wave packets of LiCl molecule excited non-adiabatically by half cycle pulse (HCP) is controlled using the second ultrashort HCP. By adjusting the time delay between the two laser pulses, constructive or destructive interference among these wave packets enables the population to be enhanced or repressed for the specific rotational state. The role played by the field strength and the pulse duration is also calculated numerically. We have used fourth order Runge-Kutta method to study non-adiabatic rotational excitation (NAREX) dynamics.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present here an unambiguous theoretical analyses and to show that the exclusive biochemical reaction involved in a single nucleotide insertion into the DNA primer can be efficiently tracked using the renormalized van derWaals (vdW) interaction of a stronger type, the Hermansson blue-shifting hydrogen bond effect, and the Arunan composite hydrogen-vdW bond. We find that there are two biochemical steps involved to complete the insertion of a single base (cytosine) into the 3' end of a DNA primer. First, the O3' (from a DNA primer) initiates the nucleophilic attack on P$_{\alpha}$ (from an incoming dCTP), in response, O3$_{\alpha}$ (bonded to P$_{\alpha}$) interacts with H' (bonded to O3'). These interactions are shown to be strongly interdependent and require the forming and breaking of P‚ÄîO and H‚ÄîO covalent bonds, which in turn imply that we do not need any external energy supply.</p>

The QCT-calculated reaction integral cross-sections are in good agreement with previous quantum wave packet results over the collision energy range of 0-50 kcal/mol. Both the abstraction and exchange reactions are governed by direct reaction dynamics and the trajectories follow the minimum energy path. The rotational angular momentum vector ùëó' of products in the two reaction channels are not only aligned perpendicular to scattering plane but also oriented along the negative direction of the axis perpendicular to the scattering plane. With the increase in collision energy, the variation trends of product polarization in the two reaction channels are different and that may be attributed to the obviously different characteristic of the two channels on the potential energy surface.</p>

				<title>Role of substituents on the reactivity and electron density profile of diimine ligands: A density functional theory based study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1247-1258</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we study the reactivity of diimines like 2, 2'-bipyridine, 1, l0-phenanthroline and 1, 2, 4-triazines using density-based reactivity descriptors. We discuss the enhancement or diminution in the reactivity of these ligands as a function of two substituent groups, namely methyl (-CH<sub>3</sub>) group and phenyl (-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) group. The global reactivity descriptors explain the global affinity and philicity of these ligands, whereas the local softness depicts the particular site selectivity. The inter-molecular reactivity trends for the same systems are analysed through the philicity and group philicity indices. The ùúé-donor character of these ligands is quantified with the help of electron density profile. In addition, the possible strength of interaction of these ligands with metal ions is supported with actual reaction energies of Ru-L complexes.</p>

				<title>DFT-based inhibitor and promoter selection criteria for pentagonal dodecahedron methane hydrate cage</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1259-1266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations have been performed to provide electronic structure property correlation based reasoning for conceptualizing the effect of encapsulated methane molecule on the formation of methane hydrate cages, the role of methanol and ethylene glycol as inhibitor and the role of tetra-hydro-furan (THF) and cyclopentane as promoter of methane hydrate. Geometry optimization of 5<sup>12</sup> cage, 5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>2</sup> cage and 5<sup>12</sup>6<sup>4</sup> cage with and without encapsulated methane and the cluster of 5<sup>12</sup> cage with ethylene glycol, methanol, cyclopentane have been performed by density functional theory using ùúîB97X-D/6-31++G(d,p) method. Methane hydrate formation inhibition by methanol and ethylene glycol as well as methane hydrate stabilization by cyclopentane and tetrahydrofuran are critically analysed based on the interaction energy, free energy change, dipole moment and infrared frequency calculation. Calculation of free energy change for formation of methane hydrate with/without reagents at various temperature and pressure using optimized structure is reported here. It is observed that hydrogen bond between water molecules of clathrate 5<sup>12</sup> cages become stronger in the presence of cyclopentane and tetrahydrofuran but weaker/broken in the presence of ethylene glycol and methanol. Simulated results correspond well with experimental findings and can be useful for designing new inhibitor and promoter molecules for gas hydrate formation.</p>

				<title>A comparative study of independent particle model based approaches for thermal averages</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1267-1275</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparative study is done on thermal average calculation by using the state specific vibrational self-consistent field method (ss-VSCF), the virtual vibrational self-consistent field (v-VSCF) method and the thermal self-consistent field (t-SCF) method. The different thermodynamic properties and expectation values are calculated using these three methods and the results are compared with full configuration interaction method (FVCI). We find that among these three independent particle model based methods, the ss-VSCF method provides most accurate results in the thermal averages followed by t-SCF and the v-VSCF is the least accurate. However, the ss-VSCF is found to be computationally very expensive for the large molecules. The t-SCF gives better accuracy compared to the v-VSCF counterpart especially at higher temperatures.</p>				</abstract>

				<title>Simulating chemical systems: MPI and GPU parallelization of novel SD algorithms</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1285-1292</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics is used for simulating chemical systems with the goal of studying a large range of phenomena starting from cell structures to the design of new materials, drugs, etc. A very important component of molecular dynamics is the use of well-suited atomistic and molecular modelling of the chemical systems. This article presents the MPI and GPU-CUDA parallelization of novel stochastic-Langevin dynamics algorithm that is used in molecular dynamics for controlling the temperature of simulated systems. The research has been performed in the Molecular Dynamics Group of the University of Groningen and it is going to be included in the next version of Gromacs tool of molecular dynamics (www.gromacs.org). The Langevin algorithm implemented is original and is based on impulse application of friction and noise. Theoretical background, implementation, an efficiency discussion and relevant simulation results are presented in the different sections of this article. The simulations used Martini water. The parallelization of the algorithms was done in two versions: one in MPI using domain decomposition and another version was done in CUDA.</p>

				<title>Self-assembled 1-octadecyl-1H-benzimidazole film on copper surface for corrosion protection</title>

				<page>1325-1338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Films of 1-octadecyl-1H-benzimidazole (OBI) have been formed on copper surface by selfassembly method. Optimum conditions viz. the solvent, concentration of OBI, immersion period and temperature for the formation of a protective film on copper have been established using impedance studies. The OBI film has been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reflection absorption Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy. Efficiency of the OBI film to protect copper from corrosion has been investigated in aq. HCl solution using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization method, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy and gravimetry. Results of these studies inferred that the OBI film has an inhibition efficiency in the range of 97-99&#37; under different conditions. Polarization studies inferred that the OBI film functions as a cathodic inhibitor. Cyclic voltammetric studies showed that the film is stable even after 15 cycles, when the copper electrode is polarized to an anodic potential of 0.35V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A novel, magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst is fabricated through simple immobilization of copper(II) acetylacetonate on the surface of amine-terminated silica-coated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles: Cu(acac)<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>2</sub>-T/SiO<sub>2</sub>&#64;Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>NPs. Unambiguous bonding of Cu to the terminal amine is indicated by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Further characterizations are carried out by different techniques. Selectivity of this catalyst is demonstrated through one-pot synthesis of fourteen Œ±-aminoacyl amides using Ugi four-component reaction of cyclohexyl isocyanide, acetic acid, amines and various aldehydes. Interestingly, all aromatic aldehydes react with short reaction times and high yields, but heteroaromatic aldehydes do not yield any product. Catalyst efficiency remains unaltered through three consecutive experiments.</p>

				<title>Synthesis and characterization of bimetallic nanocatalysts and their application in selective hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1365-1374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>TiO<sub>2</sub>-supported bimetallic nanocatalysts were prepared and reduced at two different temperatures, 375&#176;C and 575&#176;C for selective hydrogenation of citral to corresponding unsaturated alcohols (geraniol (GOL) and nerol (NOL)). The nanocatalysts were characterized by difference techniques of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The prepared nanocatalysts are uniformly dispersed with an average particle size of 50-100 nm and zero valence metallic state. Catalysts reduced at higher temperature lead to an increase in selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols (GOL and NOL). The Pt-Ru/TiO<sub>2</sub> shows higher activity compared to Pt-Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> and Pt-Au/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocatalysts. In addition, a second metal (Ru) also leads to an increase in GOL and NOL selectivity during citral hydrogenation. Partially generated oxidized second metal species due to the difference in electronegativity, strongly binds the C=O group and also paves the way for selective activation of C=O bond.</p>

				<title>Role of vanadium and pyridine in heteropolycompounds for selective oxidation of alcohols with hydrogen peroxide</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1375-1383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study describes the application of heteropolyacids H<sub>3</sub>PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>,H<sub>4</sub>SiMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>, H<sub>4</sub>PMo<sub>11</sub>VO<sub>40</sub>, H<sub>5</sub>PMo<sub>10</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>40</sub>, H<sub>9</sub>PMo<sub>6</sub>V<sub>6</sub>O<sub>40</sub>, and a hybrid pyridine-modified heteropolyacid with Keggin structure for selective oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes using aqueous hydrogen peroxide and acetonitrile as solvent. Performance of these different catalysts in 1-phenylethanol oxidation was studied. Influence of reaction temperature, amount of catalyst and hydrogen peroxide and reaction time on the yield of acetophenone was investigated to obtain optimal reaction conditions. Oxidation ability of the catalyst depended on the number of vanadium atoms present in the Keggin ion and to a lesser extent on pyridine substitution in the Keggin secondary structure. In order to explore the applicability of the method for selective oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes, various alcohols were investigated according to the general procedure using hybrid pyridine-modified heteropolyacid.</p>

				<title>Activity of B(OEt)<sub>3</sub>-MCM-41 catalyst in the MPV reduction of crotonaldehyde</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1385-1393</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mesoporous silica materialMCM-41 was functionalized with boron tri-ethoxide (B(OEt)<sub>3</sub>) groups by the grafting method and denoted as `B(OEt)<sub>3</sub>-MCM-41‚Äô. With the use of TEM, X-ray diffraction, highresolution thermogravimetry (TGA) and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherms, it was shown that the initial hexagonal structure, the high specific surface area, and porosity are retained in the functionalized material. <sup>29</sup>Si NMR- and <sup>11</sup>B NMR- spectroscopies revealed that the surface of MCM-41 consists of boron alkoxide species. The Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of crotonaldehyde to but-2-en-1-ol was conducted in the presence of B(OEt)<sub>3</sub>-MCM-41 catalyst. MPV reduction of crotonaldehyde also showed that functionalization leads to the creation of Lewis acidic sites. A combination of mesoporous structure with Lewis acidic properties makes the MCM-41 functionalized with boron tri-ethoxide groups, useful as solid Lewis acid catalysts.</p>

				<title>Purification and characterization of laccase from <i>Coriolopsis floccosa</i> MTCC-1177 and its use in the selective oxidation of aromatic methyl group to aldehyde without mediators</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1395-1403</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A laccase from the culture filtrate of white rot fungus <i>Coriolopsis floccosa</i> MTCC-1177 has been purified to homogeneity. The method involved concentration of the culture filtrate by ammonium sulphate precipitation and an anion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as well as native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE) produced single protein bands indicating that the enzyme preparation was pure. Molecular mass of the enzyme determined from SDS-PAGE analysis was 64 kDa. Using 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), 2,2'-[Azino-bis-(3-ethylbonzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) diammonium salt and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy benzaldehyde azine (syringaldazine) as the substrates, the $K_m$, $k_{\text{cat}}$ and $k_{\text{cat}}$/$K_m$ values of the laccase were found to be 112.5 ùúáM, 5.16 s<sup>-1</sup>, $4.60 \times 10^4$M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, 58 ùúáM, 5.16 s<sup>-1</sup>, $8.90 \times 10^4$M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and 100 ùúáM, 5.16 s<sup>-1</sup>, $5.16 \times 10^4$M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The pH and temperature optima were 5.0&#176;C and 40&#176;C, respectively. Activation energy for thermal denaturation of the enzyme was 36.6 kJ/mol/K. The enzyme was most stable at pH4.0 when exposed for 1 h. The purified laccase has yellow colour and does not show absorption band around 610 nm found in blue laccases. The enzyme transforms toluene, 3-nitrotoluene and 4-chlorotoluene to benzaldehyde, 3-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, respectively, in the absence of electron transfer mediators.</p>

The acridone addition products were also obtained in the reaction of allenes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> with 9-chloroacridine under [Pd]-catalysed conditions, along with (unexpected) ùõº-acridinyl substituted allenes. In contrast, 9-benzyl-6-chloro-purine reacted with <b>1</b> affording a ùõΩ-substituted purinone phosphonate. Allenes <b>1-2</b> did not react with acridones in the absence of base (CsF), but in the presence of Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub>/DMF (or DMA)/pivalic acid rearranged to give 1,3-butadienes probably via [Pd]-allyl complexes. The phosphono-acridones were amenable to Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction and led to ùëÅ-substituted acridones. Key products have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.</p>

					<p>The reaction of 4- azidochromen-2-one (1) with the nucleophilic phosphacumulene ylides <b>2</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>12</b>  afforded the new heterocyclic triazoles, triazepines, aziridine, pyrrolone containing a coumarin moiety.

					<p>Although cysteine is the preferred ligand for [Fe-S] core in case of iron-sulphur proteins, presence of other ligands together with cysteine is not uncommon. Being basically electron transfer proteins, redox potential of [Fe-S] core in these proteins in crucial to their functioning. Among other factors, charged nature of the microenvironment is believed to tune the redox potential. The iron-sulphur cluster, [Fe<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>(OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2‚àí</sup>, has been investigated electrochemically in positive and negative microenvironments, both in solution and in film. Charge nature around the active centre has been found to affect its redox potential and diffusion coefficient significantly. In a film, where charges are more localized compared to solution, the effect on redox potential was more prominent.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of new Pd(II) complexes derived from the reaction of palladium acetate with 4-(4-alkoxy-2-hydroxybenzylideneamino)azobenzene having the flexible terminal chain of OC$_n$H$_{2n+1}$, in which n are even numbers ranging from 8 to 16, has been successfully synthesized. The physical measurement and spectroscopic techniques (FTIR and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR) reveal that the Pd(II) complexes possess the Pd-N and Pd-O coordination modes in which the central Pd(II) adopts square-planar geometry. The observation under the polarized light shows that all the ligands and Pd(II) complexes exhibit enantiotropic mesophases. The ligands with ùëõ-octyloxy and ùëõ-decyloxy flexible chains exhibit the nematic (N) and smectic A (SmA) phases whilst the Pd(II) complexes show exclusive SmA phase. The SmA phase observed in Pd(II) complexes can be supported by the presence of focal conic fan-shaped texture with the presence of curved lines which are prominent during the cooling process. On the other hand, the comparison studies show that Pd(II) complexes possess exceptional higher phase transition temperatures as compared to the corresponding Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes.</p>

					<p>An amido-linked rhodamine conjugate of calix[4]arene, <b>L</b> has been synthesized and characterized. Metal ion recognition properties of <b>L</b> have been studied by emission and absorption techniques with 14 different metal ions including the transition ones. Results show that, <b>L</b> exhibits ratiometric emission intensity towards Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Composition of the complex formed in the solution has been found to be 1:2 (<b>L</b>:M$^{n+}$), based on the Job‚Äôs plot. The <b>L</b> can also act as a chemosensor for Hg<sup>2+</sup> through naked eye detection.

					<p>Two expedient one-pot methods have been developed for synthesis of ùõΩ-aryl-ùõΩ-mercaptoketones using acetophenones, benzaldehydes and thiols as starting materials. The methods involve microwave irradiation (5min) of 1:1 mixtures of acetophenones and benzaldehydes over neutral alumina supported anhydrous potassium carbonate or amberlyst-15 in the first step, and that is followed by addition of thiol to the resulting material and keeping at room temperature for 1.5 h.</p>

					<p>1,3-Oxazinan-2-one analogues are important heterocyclic compounds having significant biological activities. This study reports the synthesis of eight new 4,6-disubstituted -1,3-oxazinan-2-one analogues from corresponding homoallylic carbamates. Homoallylic carbamates were synthesized via a three-component reaction of aldehyde, allyltrimethylsilane and benzyl carbamate in presence of iodine as catalyst. In the next step, homoallylic carbamates were subjected to Sharpless dihydroxylation (racemic) to produce 3,4-dihydroxybutylcarbamate derivatives. This product was then treated with NaH in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to produce the desired 6-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxazinan-2-one in high yield.</p>

					<p>The aim of the present study was to synthesize isocoumarin heterocycles and to elucidate the potential role of these compounds as biological active agents. A new series of isocoumarin derivatives containing two six-membered lactone rings is reported. 3-Aroyl-substituted isocoumarins (<b>3</b>) obtained by condensing 2-carboxy benzaldehyde (<b>1</b>) with bromoacetophenone derivatives (<b>2</b>) was further reacted with different aromatic aldehydes (<b>4</b>) affording bis-(1ùêª-2-benzopyran-1-one) derivatives (<b>5</b>). This short review compiles examples of most promising antibacterial, antifungal and analgesic bis-(1H-2-benzopyran-1-one) derivatives. The products were characterized on the basis of analytical and spectral (IR, <sup>1</sup>HNMR, C<sup>13</sup>NMR, Mass) data. The biological activity study revealed that all compounds showed promising activities and bis-(1ùêª-2-benzopyran-1-one) derivatives (<b>5</b>) were found to be more active than 3-aroyl-substituted isocoumarins (<b>3</b>).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electronic properties of the covalent and noncovalent adsorption of single-walled boron nitride nanotube with vitamins B3 and C and their radicals are investigated through the density functional theory. Results show that noncovalent and covalent adsorption of vitamin B3 on BNNT could make these systems of interest for drug delivery purposes due to the possibility of easily detaching the pristine molecule from the BNNT surface. Noncovalent and covalent adsorption of vitamin C on BNNT result in modification of the electronic properties of BNNT, these results are extremely relevant in identifying the potential application of functionalized BNNT with vitamin C as nano-sensor. The present results are expected to provide useful guidance for the relevant experimental study.</p>

				<page>1607-1618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The adsorption of parent nitrosamine (<b>NA</b>) on the Br√∏nsted acid sites of M-ZSM-5 (M = H, Li and Na) zeolites have been investigated via the utilization of 10T cluster model by density functional calculations, at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. Two <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> complexes with two types O(N)‚Ä¶M and NH‚Ä¶O$_Z$ interactions were predicted from adsorption of nitrosamine on the M-zeolite clusters. The comparison of interaction energies shows that the order of energies for adsorption of <b>NA</b> on the Br√∏nsted acid site of M-ZSM-5 is Na  Li &#60; H for the <b>A</b> complexes and Li &#60; H for the <b>B</b> complexes. The calculated adsorption enthalpy of <b>NA</b> on the Br√∏nsted acid site of 10T cluster of M-ZSM-5 catalyst ranges from ‚àí14.41 to ‚àí52.95 kJ/mol. The acid strength of H-ZSM-5 was found to exceed those of the corresponding to the alkali metal ion-exchanged zeolites. The results reveal that the interaction between hydrogen of <b>NA</b> and O$_Z$ of framework is weaker than O(N)‚Ä¶M one. The NH‚Ä¶O$_Z$ and O(N)‚Ä¶H$_Z$ hydrogen bonds in these complexes are electrostatic and partially covalent in nature, respectively. The results of natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis showed that charge transfer occurs from <b>NA</b> to M-zeolite cluster.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We investigate the potential of numerical algorithms to decipher the kinetic parameters involved in multi-step chemical reactions. To this end, we study dimerization kinetics of protein as a model system. We follow the dimerization kinetics using a stochastic simulation algorithm and combine it with three different optimization techniques (genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and parallel tempering) to obtain the rate constants involved in each reaction step. We find good convergence of the numerical scheme to the rate constants of the process. We also perform a sensitivity test on the reaction kinetic parameters to see the relative effects of the parameters for the associated profile of the monomer/dimer distribution.</p>

				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1629-1637</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations have been performed so as to study the interaction of elemental mercury (Hg) with small neutral, cationic and anionic palladium clusters (Pd$_n$, ùëõ = 1-6). Results of these calculations clearly indicate that frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory is a useful method to predict the selectivity of Hg adsorption. Binding energies of Hg on cationic Pd$_n$ clusters are generally found to be greater than those on neutral and anionic clusters. Results of natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis show that the flow of electrons in the neutral and charged complexes is mainly due to s orbitals of Hg. NBO analysis also indicates that, in most of the cases, the binding energies of Hg with Pdn clusters are directly proportional to charge transfer, i.e., greater the charge transfer, higher is the binding energy.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An all-electron (AE) calculation of the hydrogen binding effect on charged phosphorus clusters has been performed under the framework of density functional theory (DFT). Compared with the P$^{\pm}_{2n}$ (ùëõ = 1-7) clusters, the HP$^{\pm}_{2n}$ (ùëõ = 1-7), cluster has shorter average P-P bond length, larger binding energy and HOMOLUMO gap (HLG), higher chemical hardness and frequency of P-P mode. After binding with one hydrogen atom, the electronic structure is changed from open electronic shell to closed electronic shell. Geometrical stability, chemical stability and electronic stability are strengthened. These stability enhancements may be simply understood considering the electron pairing effect.</p>

				<title>Signal amplification of dopamine using lanthanum hexacyanoferrate-modified electrode</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0011-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor has been developed using an electroactive polynuclear lanthanum hexacyanoferrate (LaHCF) complex with counter alkali cation (Na<sup>+</sup>) deposited on the glassy carbon (GC) electrode (GC/LaHCF). The GC/LaHCF-modified electrode is found to be an excellent transducer in mediating the oxidation of neurotransmitter molecule such as dopamine (DA) at physiological pH 7.2. Interestingly, the GC/LaHCF-modified electrode amplifies a 50-fold enhancement in the oxidation of DA signal compared to the bare GC electrode. Besides, the GC/LaHCF-modified electrode shows excellent selectivity in the voltammetric oxidation of DA in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA). Under optimal conditions, the GC/LaHCF modified electrode shows a linear relationship in DA oxidation between $0.1 \times 10^{‚àí6}$ and $1.0 \times 10^{‚àí6}$M with the detection limit of $1 \times 10^{‚àí8}$M (10 nM). Importantly, practical utility of the modified electrode is good in studying the real sample analysis such as dopamine hydrochloride injection assay.</p>

				<page>0017-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/Ag composites were synthesized by a solid-state method. The effect of Ag modification on the physical and electrochemical properties is discussed by the characterizations of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cycling and rate tests. The lattice parameter of Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> with a low Ag content is almost not changed, but the lattice parameter becomes larger due to the high content of Ag. Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/Ag material has a uniform particle size which is about 1 ùúám. Modification of appropriate Ag is beneficial to the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of Li<sup>+</sup>. Modification of Ag not only decreases the charge transfer resistance of Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> material, but also improves the diffusion coefficient of lithium ion. Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>/Ag (3 mass&#37;) material has the lowest charge transfer resistance, the highest diffusion coefficient of lithium ion and the best rate cycling performance.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0025-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A direct electrocatalytic activity of glucose oxidation on cuprous oxide modified glassy carbon electrode is reported. Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes were synthesized by a simple wet chemical route in the absence of surfactants. Purity, shape and morphology of Cu<sub>2</sub>O are characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS and DRS-UV. The Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation compared with bare GCE electrode. At an applied potential of +0.60V, the Cu<sub>2</sub>O electrode presented a high sensitivity of 121.7 ùúáA/mM. A linear response was obtained from 0 to 500 ùúáM, a response time less than 5 s and a detection limit of 38 ùúáM (signal/noise=3). The Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes-modified electrode was stable towards interfering molecules like uric acid (UA), ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA). In short, a facile chemical preparation process of cuprous oxide nanocubes, and the fabricated modified electrode allow highly sensitive, selective, and fast amperometric sensing of glucose, which is promising for the future development of non-enzymatic glucose sensors.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>N&#8242;,N&#8243;,N&#8244; tris(2-pyridyloxymethyl) ethane (TPOME) has been used as an ionophore in a polyvinylchloride (PVC)-based membrane. Membrane electrode with a composition 30:5:62:3 (PVC:TPOME: o-NPOE:NaTPB) exhibits Nernstian response towards Pb(II) ions with a slope of 30mV/decade, over a concentration range of $1 \times 10^{‚àí5}$ M to $1  \times 10^{‚àí1}$ M. Potential response remains almost unchanged over pH range of 3.7-6.4. The electrode shows fast response time of $15 \pm 2$ s and a lifetime of four months. It shows good selectivity for Pb(II) ions over other mono-, di- and trivalent cations. Electrode response is satisfactory in mixed solvent media up to 30&#37; (v/v) non-aqueous contents. Selectivity of the ionophore for Pb(II) ions was determined by spectrophotometric method. The electrode can also be used as an indicator electrode in potentiometric titration of Pb(II) ions with standard chromate solution and its determination in real-life samples. Surface morphology of membrane electrode at different stages of its development and use is also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polyaniline(PANI) chemically coated on poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane based on a neutral carrier 7,16-didecyl-1,4,10,13-tetraoxa-7,16-diazacyclooctadecane (kryptofix 22 DD) as the active component has been developed for determination of pH values ranging from pH 0.1-1. The effect of experimental parameters such as membrane composition, nature and amount of plasticizer, lipophilic additives and thickness of PANI film on the potential response of the pH electrode was investigated. The electrode has an apparent Nernstian response slope of 54.5 ¬± 0.4 mV pH<sup>-1</sup> (at 20&#176;C). The equilibrium water content of the electrode was determined in pure water and NaCl solution (I = 0.1 mol Kg<sup>-1</sup>). The electrode had low electric resistance, good potential stability and reproducibility (¬±1.5 mV, ùëõ = 10). It has a rapid potential response to changes of pH (15 s). The excellent performance in terms of linearity, stability and fast response makes this device suitable for pH measurements in highly acidic media.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of acid concentration on excited state intramolecular charge transfer reaction of 4-(azetidinyl) benzonitrile (P4C) in aprotic (acetonitrile and ethyl acetate) and protic (ethanol) solvents have been studied by means of steady state absorption and fluorescence, and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. While absorption and fluorescence bands of P4C have been found to be shifted towards higher energy with increasing acid concentration in acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, no significant dependence has been observed in ethanolic solutions. Reaction rate becomes increasingly slower with acid concentration in acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. In contrast, acid in ethanolic solutions does not produce such an effect on reaction rate. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations have been performed to understand the observed spectroscopic results.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0065-0073</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New cerium-based ceramic pigments, displaying Ce<sub>2</sub>Pr<sub>0.2</sub>Fe$_x$O$_{4.3+y}$ stoichiometry, were obtained at low temperature using a sol-gel method. The powder precursor dissolved in 80&#37; ethylene glycol was precipitated using ammonia and the obtained gel calcined at 800&#176;C for 2 h to yield homogeneous and crystalline particles with a diameter of around 150 nm. The oxide was composed of cerium in its +4 oxidation state and Pr in its +3 oxidation state. The oxides with varying Fe content had an intense red-brown colour, with bandgap energy of around 2.2 eV at 0.1 mol&#37; Fe doping. The near infra red reflectance from these pigments, a measure of their ability to reflect rather than absorb heat waves from sunlight was found to be 82.7&#37;, even in the absence of a white reflective base. Such high near infra red reflectance from these pigments qualify them for being ideal cool pigments for surface coating applications.</p>

				<title>Synthesis, characterization and photoluminescence properties of graphene oxide functionalized with azo molecules</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0075-0083</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two different azo molecules functionalized graphene oxide (GO) through an ester linkage have been synthesized for the first time. Chemical structure of the azo-GO hybrids was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy. The GO functionalized with 5-((4-methoxyphenyl)azo)-salicylaldehyde was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The SEM studies demonstrated that the morphology of the azo-GO hybrid was found to be similar to the GO sheets but slightly more wrinkled. Further, TEM image of azo-GO indicates some dark spots on the GO sheets due to azo functionalization. AFM results also reveal that the azo functionalization increases the thickness of GO sheet to 4-5 nm from 1.2-1.8 nm. Both the azo-hybrids show absorption band around 379 nm due to the $\pi-\pi^\ast$ transition of the trans azo units. Photoluminescence spectra of azo-GO hybrids show a strong quenching compared with azo molecules due to the photoinduced electron or energy transfer from the azo chromophore to the GO sheets. It also reveals strong electronic interaction between azo and GO sheets.</p>

				<title>Could glutaric acid (GA) replace glutaraldehyde in the preparation of biocompatible biopolymers with high mechanical and thermal properties?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0127-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the field of natural and/or synthetic polymer preparation and stabilization, glutaraldehyde is the most commonly used cross-linker. Glutaraldehyde is focused by several scientists due its ease of cross-linking ability through the formation of Schiff base type of compound. Though glutaraldehyde cross-linked product has several advantages, the main drawback lies with the toxicity and poor mechanical stability. The poor mechanical strength of glutaraldehyde cross-linked product is due to the bonding pattern (-C=N-) between glutaraldehyde and amine group containing compound, where, there is a large energy barrier to rotation associated with groups joined by double bond. This is the time to search for an alternative cross-linker which will provide a non-toxic and mechanically stable biopolymer material. In order to achieve the requisite property, in the present study, we have chosen glutaric acid (oxidized form of glutaraldehyde) and studied its interaction with chitosan and type-I collagen. The chemistry behind the interaction and the characteristics of the biopolymer material obtained upon cross-linking suggests that non-covalent interactions play a major role in deciding the property of the said materials and its suitability for biomedical applications.</p>

					<p>Pd/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts were prepared via colloid deposition and the performance of the catalysts was examined in the selective hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to succinic anhydride. When the reaction was carried on in a batch system with 1,4-dioxane as the solvent (353K and 1.0MPa), high conversion of maleic anhydride (&#62;98&#37;) and high selectivity (&#62;99&#37;) for succinic anhydride were observed after 5 h. The as-prepared Pd/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst also showed excellent performance in solvent-free system and fixed-bed systems. The maleic anhydride (MA) conversion was greater than 98&#37;, and high selectivity (&#62;99&#37;) for succinic anhydride was obtained after 1600 h in a fixed bed reacter. The results showed that the activity of the Pd/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts was excellent due to its high active surface area.</p>

					<p>We have prepared 4-nitrobenzamide-adenine conjugates (<b>8</b>, <b>13</b>  and <b>14</b>) linked with versatile spacer such as triethylene glycol (TEG), aminocaproic acid and ethyl chains which were eventually reduced to obtain the corresponding 4-aminobenzamide-adenine conjugates (<b>1-3</b>) in good yields. These conjugates bear a nucleobase for DNA recognition or self-assembly through base-pair complementarity, a biocompatible linker for interfacing with biological system, and a p-aminobenzamide moiety for pharmacological applications. The use of hydrophilic or lipophilic linkers may tune the dispersibility of these conjugates in different solvents, as well as impart different properties. In the preliminary experiments the versatility and application of these linkers has been tested for functionalization of SWCNTs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reversed phase HPLC separation and isolation of isomers of 2-hydroxy-4-naphthoquinone-1-oxime (Lwox) and 3-methyl-2-hydroxy-4-naphthoquinone-1-oxime (Phox) have been investigated. Two distinct peaks are observed in the chromatogram of Lwox and are assigned to `para‚Äô tautomer; 2-hydroxy-4-naphthoquinone-1-oxime (<b>3</b>) and `ortho‚Äô tautomer; 4-hydroxy-2-naphthoquinone-1-oxime (<b>4</b>). The tautomeric equilibrium of <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>  has been manipulated by incrementally increasing the pH of the mobile phase from 2.5 to 10.5, and altering the solvent polarity. At pH &#62; 6.8 the tautomers are well-separated from each other. There is no separation of Phox isomers between pH 2.5 and 10.5. Isolation of the tautomers has been carried out by preparative HPLC, with <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>  obtained as ammonium bicarbonate adducts and characterized by LC-MS, FTIR, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Red-orange <b>3</b> is characterized by a paranaphthoquinone stretch at 1287 cm<sup>-1</sup> and a charge transfer band at 420 nm; yellow <b>4</b>  exhibits, a similar stretch at 1246 cm<sup>-1</sup> and absorption band at 406 nm. Compounds <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>  were screened for selective antiproliferative activity in three cancer cell lines of different tissue types (COLO 205 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma),U87 MG (glioblastoma astrocytoma) and MIAPaCa-2 (human pancreatic carcinoma). Geometry-optimized structures for tautomers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>  (<b>3&#8242;</b> and <b>4&#8242;</b> in Phox) were computed using the B3LYP method. Structures, <b>3</b> and <b>3&#8242;</b> are 4.7 and 5.8 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> more stabilized than <b>4</b>  and <b>4&#8242;</b>, respectively, as a result of a hydrogen bond interaction between the 2-hydroxyl group and the nitrogen of the oxime.</p>

				<title>Some new IIB group complexes of an imidazolidine ligand: Synthesis, spectral characterization, electrochemical, thermal and antimicrobial propert</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0227-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An imidazolidine Schiff base ligand, (E)-N-(4-nitrobenzylidene)-2-(2-(4-nitrophenyl) imidazolidine-1-yl) ethaneamine (L) has been synthesized by a condensation reaction between N'-(2-aminoethyl)-ethane-1,2-diamine and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in 1:2 ratio and then characterized by physical and spectral data. Some new complexes with general formula of MLX<sub>2</sub>(wherein M is Zn(II),Cd(II) and Hg(II) and X is chloride, bromide and/or iodide) have been prepared and characterized by physical and spectroscopic studies such as elemental analysis, molar conductance measurements, FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR and UV-Visible electronic spectra. The spectral data indicate that the ligand is coordinated to zinc(II) as a bidentate ligand in imidazolidine form but it binds to other metal salts as bis-imine tridentate ligand. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry technique was applied for recording the electrochemical behaviour of the ligand and its complexes. Cyclic voltamogram of the ligand showed that it is reduced at four cathodic potentials and then oxidized only in two anodic potentials in reverse direction. The electrochemical behaviour of ligand is affected by coordination. Thermal analysis of ligand and its complexes revealed that they are decomposed via 3-4 thermal steps. Moreover, some activation thermodynamic parameters such as A, E<sup>&#8727;</sup>, ùõ•H<sup>&#8727;</sup>, ùõ•S<sup>&#8727;</sup> and ùõ•G<sup>&#8727;</sup> were calculated based on TG/DTA plots using Coats-Redfern relation. The Schiff base ligand and its complexes have also been tested <i>in vitro</i> to evaluate their antimicrobial activities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The complexes of poly(methyl vinyl ether-<i>alt</i>-maleic anhydride) (poly(MVE-<i>alt</i>-MA)) with Zn(II), Mn(II) and Cu(II) ions were synthesized from the reaction of the aqueous solution of copolymer and metal(II) chlorides at different temperatures ranging from 25&#176; to 40&#176;C. Elemental analysis of themetal-polymer complexes suggests that the metal to ligand ratio is 1:1. The formation constants of each complex were determined by the mol-ratio method. UV-Vis studies showed that the complex formation tendency increased in the following order: Zn(II) &#62; Cu(II) &#62; Mn(II). This order was confirmed by the Irving-William series and Pearson‚Äôs classification. The IR spectral data indicated the metal ions to be coordinated through the hydroxyl groups of the hydrolysed maleic anhydride. The intrinsic viscosity and thermal properties of the copolymer and metal-polymer complexes and their thermal stability are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The first mesogenic Cu(II) complex with [1,2,3]-triazole-based bidentate Schiff bases with flexible terminal alkyl chain, C$_n$H$_{2n+1}$ (even parity of n = 10-18) has been successfully synthesized. The heterocyclic triazole core was introduced into the target compound through the click reaction between azidoalkane and propargyl aldehyde. All the uncoordinated ligands and target complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and UV-visible spectroscopic techniques. The observation under the polarized light and differential scanning calometry (DSC) shows that the triazole-based ligands exhibit unstable SmA phase which are not reproducible upon subsequent heating and cooling. Interestingly, the whole homologues of Cu(II) complexes show exclusively stable focal conic fan-shaped texture characteristic of SmA phase. This can be ascribed to the presence of Cu-N and Cu-O coordination modes which enhance the collinearity and molecular anisotropy. On the other hand, the Cu(II) complexes are thermally more stable as compared to their corresponding ligands.</p>

				<title>Electron paramagnetic resonance study of ternary Cu<sup>II</sup> compounds with glycine and phenanthroline</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0255-0264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements at 9 and 34 GHz, and room temperature (ùëá), in powder and single crystal samples of the ternary compounds of copper nitrate or copper chloride with glycine and 1,10-phenanthroline [Cu(Gly)(phen)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]¬∑NO<sub>3</sub>¬∑1.5H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>1</b>) and [Cu(Gly)(phen)Cl]<sub>2</sub>¬∑7H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>2</b>). In compound <b>1</b>, the copper ions are arranged in 1-D chains along one of the crystal axes connected by <i>syn-anti</i> carboxylate ligands, while in <b>2</b> the array is nearly 3-D and the connections involve ùêª-bonds and stacking interactions. The angular variation of the squared g-factor and the line width were measured as a function of orientation of the magnetic field ($B_0$) in three orthogonal crystal planes. In both compounds we observed one resonance without hyperfine structure for any magnetic field orientation which we attribute to the collapse of the hyperfine coupling and of the resonances of two chemically identical but rotated coppers in the unit cell, produced by exchange interactions. We analyse the results in terms of the structures of the compounds and chemical paths connecting neighbour copper ions which support the exchange interactions between neighbour spins in the lattice. Considering the collapse of the EPR signals of rotated sites in the lattices we are able to set lower limits to the exchange interactions, which are supported by weak equatorial-apical carboxylate bridges in <b>1</b>, and by paths containing hydrogen bonds and aromatic ùúã-ùúã interactions in <b>2</b>. Broadening due to dipole-dipole couplings and hyperfine interactions are strongly reduced by these exchange couplings and their role in the EPR line width is more difficult to recognize.</p>

				<title>Theoretical studies on the mechanism of palladium(II)-catalysed <i>ortho</i>-carboxylation of acetanilide with CO</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0265-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanism of palladium(II)-catalysed carboxylation of acetanilide with CO has been investigated using density functional theory calculation done at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p)(SDD for Pd) level of theory. Solvent effects on these reactions have been explored by calculation that included a polarizable continuum model (PCM) for the solvent. Two plausible pathways which led to the formation of anhydride or benzoxazinone intermediate structure were proposed. Our calculated results suggested that the steps of forming the anhydride or benzoxazinone intermediate became the rate-determining one in the whole catalytic cycle. The process of forming benzoxazinone is more favoured kinetically with a barrier of 16.6 kcal/mol versus 22.9 kcal/mol for the pathway of forming anhydride structure. Subsequent hydrolysis process of these intermediates then provide the corresponding product <i>ortho</i>-acetaminobenzoic acid. The computational results are consistent with the experimental observations of Yu <i>et al</i>. for palladium(II)-catalysed synthesis of acetanilide based on carbon monoxide.</p>

				<title>Theoretical studies on proton transfer reaction of 3(5)-substituted pyrazoles</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0273-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inter and intra molecular proton transfer reactions of a series of pyrazole derivatives have been studied by using density functional theory (DFT) andMP2 methods implementing 6-311++G(d,p) atomic basis set. The substituents have been selected to cover a wide range of electronic effects. Proton transfer process was studied for mechanisms including single proton transfer, double proton transfer and proton transfer assisted by a water or ammonia molecule. The results showed single proton transfer reactions for interconversion pyrazole derivatives need highest activation energies in the range of 45.7‚àí51.59 and 49.4‚àí53.96 kcal/mol at B3LYP and MP2 levels, respectively. It was found that for the 3-substituted pyrazoles, electron withdrawing groups form stronger dimers but in the 5-substituted tautomers electron donating groups form stronger hydrogen bond. The double proton transfer reactions between dimers were studied and transition states calculated. The ranges of activation energies were found to be 17.51‚àí19.36 and 17.02‚àí17.80 kcal/mol for the <b>C</b> $\to$ <b>E</b> and <b>D</b> $\to$ <b>D</b> reactions respectively. In addition, the activation energies for the proton transfer reaction assisted by water or ammonia molecules were found to be in the range of 26.62‚àí31.78 and 17.25‚àí22.46 kcal/mol, respectively, calculated at MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory.</p>

				<page>0283-0292</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A theoretical study of the regio- and stereoselectivities of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between methyl crotonate and pyrroline-1-oxide has been carried out using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The reaction has been followed by performing transition state optimization, calculations of intrinsic reaction coordinate and activation energies; the molecular mechanism of the reactions is concerted and asynchronous. The regio- and exo/endo-selectivity have been explained in terms of frontier molecular orbital interactions, local and global electrophilicity and nucleophilicity indices and an analysis of theWiberg bond indices in the transition state. The FMO analysis and DFT-based reactivity indices showed that the regioselectivity of this reaction is controlled by the HOMO<sub>dipole</sub>-LUMO<sub>dipolarophile</sub> interaction. The activation parameters indicated favoured endo approach along the meta-pathway in agreement with the experimental results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The mechanism and regioselectivity of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions of sulphur-centred 1,3-dipoles including thiocarbonyl S-imide (D1), thiocarbonyl S-oxide (D2) and thiocarbonyl S-sulphide (D3) with an electron-deficient dipolarophile, furan-2,3-dione (DPh), were studied in the light of some theoretical approaches, namely, activation energy, density functional theory (DFT) reactivity indices and Houk‚Äôs rule based on the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory at the B3LYP/6-311++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> level. The present analysis reveals that the cycloaddition reactions under study can be classified in the normal electron demand category. An excellent agreement was observed between the kinetic results and the electronic approaches; in fact, maximum hardness principle (MHP), Chattaraj‚Äôs polar model, Houk‚Äôs rule and the Gazquez-Mendez rule confirm the resultant regioselectivity based on the calculated activation energies.</p>

				<title>Engineering reactors for catalytic reactions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0341-0351</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Catalytic reactions are ubiquitous in chemical and allied industries. A homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst which provides an alternative route of reaction with lower activation energy and better control on selectivity can make substantial impact on process viability and economics. Extensive studies have been conducted to establish sound basis for design and engineering of reactors for practising such catalytic reactions and for realizing improvements in reactor performance. In this article, application of recent (and not so recent) developments in engineering reactors for catalytic reactions is discussed. Some examples where performance enhancement was realized by catalyst design, appropriate choice of reactor, better injection and dispersion strategies and recent advances in process intensification/ multifunctional reactors are discussed to illustrate the approach.</p>

				<title>Development of new deactivation method for simulation of fluid catalytic cracking equilibrium catalyst</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0353-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Selection of a good catalyst is the easiest way to increase profitability of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. During operation, these catalysts get deactivated due to operation at high temperatures, steam and deposition of metals on the catalyst. Developing a proper catalyst deactivation method is crucial for optimization of a good catalyst for FCC. Conventional laboratory deactivation procedures include direct metal impregnation method, cyclic deactivation method (CDM) and cyclic propylene steaming (CPS). Direct metal impregnation method gives higher coke and gas yields. CDM and CPS methods implementation is very difficult and time-consuming and there is a deviation in coke and gas yield. New rapid deactivation method has been developed to simulate plant equilibrium catalyst (E-Cat) by modifying metal impregnation, steaming and oxidation/reduction procedures. The E-Cat generated through a new deactivation method was characterized for physico-chemical properties using X ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and SEM-EDX and activity studies. XRD studies show that metals are dispersed well on catalyst samples. SEMEDX studies reveal that the morphology of simulated E-Cat and plant E-Cat catalyst particles appear to be same. E-Cat obtained by new deactivationmethod gives better coke and gas yields. Two E-Cats were also generated through CDM and direct metal impregnation method for comparing with the one generated through new method. New deactivation method also significantly reduces the evaluation time.</p>

				<title>Novel nanostructured CeO<sub>2</sub> as efficient catalyst for energy and environmental applications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0361-0372</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here versatile methods to engineer the microstructure and understand the fundamental physicochemical properties of CeO<sub>2</sub> to improve its catalytic viability for practical applications. In this context, different morphologies of CeO<sub>2</sub> are synthesized using tailored homogeneous precipitation methods and characterized by XRD, BET, SEM and TPR methods. The shuttle-shaped CeO<sub>2</sub> prepared under hydrothermal condition shows higher surface area and low-temperature reducibility. The 0.5 wt&#37; Pt-impregnated shuttle-shaped CeO<sub>2</sub> shows lower-temperature CO oxidation behaviour as compared to its bulk-like CeO<sub>2</sub> (with 0.5 wt&#37; Pt) counterpart, synthesized by conventional-reflux method. Further, nanorod morphology of CeO2 prepared with Cl‚àías counter ion shows lower-temperature oxidation of soot as compared to the mesoflower morphology of CeO<sub>2</sub>, prepared with NO$^‚àí_3$ as counter ion in the reaction medium. Further, linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and CO-stripping voltammetry studies are performed to evaluate the promoting activity of CeO<sub>2</sub> to Pt/C for ethanol electro-oxidation reaction in acidic media. Results show that CeO<sub>2</sub> provides active triple-phase-interfacial sites for suitable adsorption of OH species which effectively oxidize the CO<sub>ads</sub> on Pt/C. The results presented here are significant in the context of understanding the physicochemical fine prints of CeO<sub>2</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub> based hetero-nanocomposites for their suitability to important catalytic and energy-related applications.</p>

				<title>Value addition to lignocellulosics and biomass-derived sugars: An insight into solid acid-based catalytic methods</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0373-0385</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the synthesis of important platform chemicals such as sugars (xylose and arabinose) and furans (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)) from carbohydrates (hemicellulose and fructose) solid acid catalysts are employed. Similarly, over solid acid catalysts, conversion of lignin into aromatic monomers is performed. It is observed that in the dehydration of fructose, because of higher hydrothermal stability, silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) catalysts give better activity (78&#37; HMF yield) compared with other solid acid catalysts (&#60;63&#37; HMF yield) at 175&#176;C. Particularly, SAPO-44 catalyst can be reused at least 5 times with marginal decrease in the activity. Zeolite, HUSY (Si/Al = 15) is active in the conversion of isolated (pure) hemicellulose to produce 41&#37; C<sub>5</sub> sugars in water. The catalyst is also active in the selective conversion of hemicellulose from bagasse to yield 59&#37; C<sub>5</sub> sugars. It is possible to obtain high yields of furfural (54&#37;) directly from bagasse if instead of water, water+toluene solvent system is used. Depolymerization of lignin using HUSY catalyst produced aromatic monomers with 60&#37; yield at 250&#176;C. A detailed catalyst characterization study is performed to understand the correlation between catalyst activity and morphology. To understand the effect of impurities present in the substrate over solid acid catalysts, metal-exchange study is carried out.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Bioglycerol an inevitable by-product in the production of biodiesel was effectively utilized for the synthesis of 2-methylpyrazine (2-MP) by vapour phase dehydrocyclization with ethylenediamine over ZnOZnCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(Zn-Cr-O) mixed oxides. These Zn-Cr-O samples were obtained from hydrotalcite precursors synthesized by precipitation method at different pH (‚àº7 and 9) and calcination in air at 450&#176;C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis confirmed the presence of ZnCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> species. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated spherical particles with mean diameter of 35.8 and 24 nm for the Zn-Cr-O prepared at pH ‚àº 7 and ‚àº9, respectively. Surface Zn enrichment was observed in the near-surface region of Zn-Cr-Oprepared at pH‚àº9. Differences in dehydrocyclization activity of Zn-Cr-Omixed oxideswere established based on spectroscopic data that emphasized changes in structural properties of Zn-Cr-O obtained at different pH.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of pressured carbon dioxide on heterogeneous hydrogenation of benzaldehyde and homogeneous dehydration of sorbitol in water solvent was studied. Initial hydrogenation rates of benzaldehyde over a charcoal-supported palladium catalyst in water at 313 K were enhanced by the addition of carbon dioxide. The initial rate increased with an increase in carbon dioxide pressure and became a maximum at 5 MPa. Dehydration of sorbitol proceeded in water phase at 500 K and initial dehydration rates were enhanced by addition of 30 MPa of carbon dioxide.</p>

				<title>Novel catalysts for valorization of biomass to value-added chemicals and fuels</title>

				<page>0403-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Key furan compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) were synthesized from renewable feedstocks. Dehydration of fructose was carried out in biphasic conditions employing several solid acid catalysts by targeting selective formation of HMF. Its selectivity is linearly dependent on total acidity clearly revealing that lower acidity favours selective formation of HMF. Oxidation and hydrogenolysis of HMF has been explored using 2 wt&#37; Ru-K-OMS-2. The catalysts used for each transformation were subjected to detailed characterization using XRD, BET surface area, temperature-programmed desorption and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of various reaction parameters was also investigated for obtaining high yields of desired chemical intermediates. High FDCA yields of 93.4 mol&#37; and 66 mol&#37; were achieved in alkaline and base-free conditions, respectively. The 2 wt&#37; Ru-K-OMS-2 is a versatile catalyst as it also catalyses HMF hydrogenolysis giving 33 mol&#37; of DMF. Thus, utility of various novel materials as catalysts has been demonstrated in the multistep transformations of hexoses to furan-based fuels and chemicals.</p>

					<p>CeO<sub>2</sub>-Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxides were synthesized by a modified coprecipitation method and subjected to thermal treatments at different temperatures to understand their thermal behaviour. The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, BET, TEM, Raman and TPR techniques.

Raman studies further confirmed the presence of oxygen vacancies and lattice defects in the CG sample. TPR measurements indicated a facile reduction of ceria after Gd<sup>3+</sup> addition. Activity studies revealed that incorporation of Gd<sup>3+</sup> into the ceria matrix favoured the creation of more structural defects, which accelerates the oxidation rate of soot compared to pure ceria.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ordered mesoporous material SBA-15 was synthesized and used as a support for the preparation of molybdenum sulphide catalysts through precipitation from homogeneous solution (PFHS) technique with the Mo content varying from 2-12 wt&#37;. The prepared catalysts were evaluated for thiophene hydrodesulphurization catalytic activities at 400$^\circRC. Catalysts prepared through PFHS method resulted in highly dispersed MoS<sub>2</sub> catalysts, which were inferred from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low temperature oxygen chemisorptions (LTOC) and BET surface area analysis. The relationship between XPS intensity ratio, oxygen chemisorption and catalytic activities is discussed in terms of highly dispersed nano particles of MoS<sub>2</sub> and its consequence in accommodating more promoted atoms at the edge sites.</p>

				<title>Characterization and reactivity of 11-molybdo-1-vanadophosphoric acid catalyst supported on zirconia for dehydration of glycerol to acrolein</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0445-0454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of vanadium-substituted phosphomolybdic acid (HPA) catalysts supported on zirconia were prepared by impregnation method with varying the HPA active phase content from 10 to 50 wt&#37; on the support. The calcined catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, temperatureprogrammed desorption of NH<sub>3</sub>, FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption and surface area measurements. XRD results suggest that the active phase of heteropolyacid is present in a highly dispersed state at lower loadings and as a crystalline phase at higher HPA loadings and these findings are well-supported by the results of FT-IR and Raman spectra. Calcination of the samples did not affect the Keggin ion structure of HPA. The ammonia TPD results suggest that acidity of the catalysts was found to increase with increase of HPA loading up to 40 wt&#37; and decreases at higher loadings. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption show that the Br√∏nsted acidic sites increase with increase of HPA loadings up to 40 wt&#37; catalyst. However, Lewis acid sites decrease with increase ofHPA loading. Catalytic properties were evaluated during vapour phase dehydration of glycerol to acrolein. The catalyst with 40 wt&#37; HPA has exhibited excellent selectivity towards acrolein formation with complete conversion of glycerol at 225&#176;C under atmospheric pressure. Catalytic performances during dehydration of glycerol are well-correlated with acidity of the catalysts.</p>

				<title>Anomalous hydrocracking of triglycerides over CoMo-catalyst-influence of reaction intermediates</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0473-0480</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction intermediates have been identified and followed to understand anomalous cracking of jathropha oil triglycerides in the presence of sulphided Co-Mo/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst. Undesirable C-C coupling reactions are favoured at temperatures between 320&#176; and 340&#176;C, giving waxy oligomerization products, whereas at temperatures above 340&#176;C, direct hydrocracking of triglycerides to lighter and middle distillates were favoured. To minimize undesirable waxy oligomerization products, higher pressures (&#62;80 bar) and higher H<sub>2</sub>/feed ratios (&#62;1500) were necessary. Aldol condensation and ketonization reactions between the reaction intermediates are counter-productive as they result in waxy long chain oxygenated products which tend to accumulate on the catalyst surface, choke the reactor and cause rapid catalyst deactivation. Reaction conditions have to be optimized to minimize condensation reaction during this process.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogenation of CO<sub>2</sub> to hydrocarbons over iron nanoparticles supported on oxygenfunctionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes was studied in a fixed-bed U-tube reactor at 25 bar with a H<sub>2</sub>:CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of 3. Conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> was approximately 35&#37; yielding C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> products at 360&#176;C with methane and CO as major products. The CO<sub>2</sub> equilibrium conversion for temperatures in the range of 320&#176; to 420&#176;C was analysed by using CHEMCAD simulation software. Comparison between experimental and simulated degrees of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion shows that reverse water gas shift equilibrium had been achieved in the investigated temperature range and that less than 47&#37; of CO<sub>2</sub> can be converted to CO at 420&#176;C.</p>

				<title>Ammoxidation of 2-methyl pyrazine on supported ammonium salt of 12-molybdophosphoric acid catalysts: The influence of nature of support</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0487-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Influence of the nature of support on the formation of catalytically active species was investigated to clarify the key factor for the synthesis of supported ammonium salt of 12-molybdophosphoric acid (AMPA) catalyst which maintains the activity of ammoxidation during 2-methylpyrazine reaction.With this aim, different loadings of niobia-, silica- and alumina-, supported AMPA catalysts were prepared. The AMPA loading was varied in the range of 5-25 wt&#37;. The synthesized solids were characterized by nitrogen adsorption for BET surface area, XRD and <sup>31</sup>P MAS NMR techniques. All the AMPA-supported samples are poorly crystalline even after 25 wt&#37; AMPA loading. Investigations using <sup>31</sup>P MAS NMR spectroscopy of samples revealed that Keggin ion existed as at least five different species on the supports. The investigated properties were acidity of the support and amount of AMPA loading on the support. Active sites for the ammoxidation of MP on supported AMPA catalysts seem to be the interacted and/or the lacunary species.Maximum catalytic activity could be obtained at lower loadings with AMPA deposited on acidic supports whereas the less acidic supports require higher loading. It was found that in order to efficiently generate the active interactive species, the support must have an acidity which promotes the formation of support-AMPA interactive species. It is possible to enhance the catalytic activity of the supported AMPA catalyst for ammoxidation of 2-methylpyrazine by controlling the acidity of the support and AMPA loading on the support.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fe-Zn and Co-Zn double-metal cyanide (DMC) complexes exhibit highly efficient and selective catalytic activity for synthesis of hyperbranched polyesters (glycerol-succinic acid (G-SA) and glycerol-adipic acid (G-AA)) and aliphatic polycarbonates (via., alternative co-polymerization of cyclohexene oxide and CO<sub>2</sub>), respectively. The influence of method of preparation of DMC, in particular the mode of addition of reagents, on its physicochemical and catalytic properties was investigated. Co-Zn DMC was found highly selective for polycarbonate (than polyethers) formation. Catalysts prepared using tert-butanol and PEG-4000 as complexing and co-complexing agents, respectively, were found superior to those prepared without these agents. Apart from its role as a coordinating ligand, <i>tert</i>-butanol activated the Lewis acidic Zn<sup>2+</sup> sites for reactions in polyester and polycarbonate formation. Hydrophobicity, micro-mesoporosity, acid strength and the amount of coordinated complexing agent are some of the crucial factors influenced the catalytic activity of DMC complexes.</p>

				<title>Determination of conduction and valence band electronic structure of anatase and rutile TiO<sub>2</sub></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0511-0515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electronic structures of rutile and anatase polymorph of TiO<sub>2</sub> were determined by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering measurements and FEFF9.0 calculations. Difference between crystalline structures led to shifts in the rutile Ti ùëë-band to lower energy with respect to anatase, i.e., decrease in band gap. Anatase possesses localized states located in the band gap where electrons can be trapped, which are almost absent in the rutile structure. This could well explain the reported longer lifetimes in anatase. It was revealed that HR-XAS is insufficient to study in-depth unoccupied states of investigated materials because it overlooks the shallow traps.</p>

				<page>0517-0525</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nanocrystalline PrFeO<sub>3</sub> perovskite type orthoferrite was synthesized at 700&#176;C by using three different synthesis methods, namely sol-gel, template and combustion method. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, BET-SA, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, FTIR and UV-DRS techniques to understand their physico-chemical properties. Characterization data reveal the formation of nanocrystalline PrFeO<sub>3</sub> perovskite composition with improved physical properties, possibly due to lower synthesis temperature used. PrFeO<sub>3</sub> synthesized by sol-gel method consists of crystallite size of about 20 nm with absorption maxima at 595 nm wavelength in visible light range. This photocatalyst shows hydrogen generation of about 2847 ùúámol.g<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>, under visible light irradiation in ethanol-water system. The photocatalyst was further investigated for various operational parameters such as photocatalyst dose variation, illumination intensity, time, etc. in a view to optimize the hydrogen generation as well as to understand mechanistic aspects. This material appears to follow a semiconductor type mechanism for ethanol-assisted visible light photocatalyic water-splitting and can also be an interesting candidate to develop hetero-junction type photocatalysts.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Porous chromium terephthalate MIL-101 (Cr-MIL-101) has been prepared by direct method under hydrothermal conditions and characterized using X-ray diffraction, N<sub>2</sub> sorption, TGA and FT-IR. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm shows that the Cr-MIL-101 possesses BET specific surface area of 2563 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Catalytic performance of Cr-MIL-101 in the dehydration of 1,4-butanediol and 1-phenylethanol is assessed under vapour phase conditions in the temperature range of 513-533 K and time on stream (TOS) at 513 K. Cr-MIL-101 demonstrates superior catalytic activity with conversion of 95&#37; of 1-phenylethanol. Moreover, high surface area and nanocages with coordinated unsaturated sites of Cr-MIL-101 have allowed us to attain higher dehydrated products selectivity than Cr-supported activated carbon (Cr/AC), amberlyst-15 and HZSM-5 catalysts.</p>

				<feature>Rapid Communication</feature>
				<page>0541-0545</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As-prepared graphene oxide (GO) contains oxidative debris which can be washed using basic solutions. We present the isolation and characterization of these debris. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is used to monitor the separation of the debris in various solvents in the presence of different protic and aprotic alkylamino bases. The study reveals that the debris are rich in carbonyl functional groups and water is an essential component for separation and removal of the debris from GO under oxidative reaction conditions.</p>

				<title>Glyoxylate as a reducing agent for manganese(III) in salen scaffold: A kinetics and mechanistic study</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0547-0559</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of oxidation of glyoxylic acid (HGl) by Mn<sup>III</sup>(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)$^+_2$ ((H<sub>2</sub>salen = N,N'- bis(salicylidene)ethane-1,2-diamine) is investigated at 30.0-45.0&#176;C, 1.83 &#8804; pH &#8804; 6.10, I = 0.3 mol dm<sup>-3</sup>(NaClO<sub>4</sub>). The products are identified as formic acid, CO<sub>2</sub> and Mn<sup>II</sup> with the reaction stoichiometry, |ùõ•[Mn<sup>III</sup>]/ùõ•[HGl]| = 2. The overall reaction involves fast equilibrium pre-association of Mn<sup>III</sup>(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)$^+_2$ with HGl and its conjugate base Gl<sup>‚àí</sup> forming the corresponding inner sphere complexes (both HGl and Gl<sup>‚àí</sup> being the monohydrate gem-diol forms) followed by the slow electron transfer steps. In addition, the second order electron transfer reactions involving the inner-sphere complexes and HGl/Gl<sup>‚àí</sup> are also observed. The rate, equilibrium constants and activation parameters for various steps are presented. Mn<sup>III</sup>(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)(Gl) is virtually inert to intra molecular electron transfer while the process is facile for Mn<sup>III</sup>(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)(HGl)<sup>+</sup> (10$^5k_{et} = 2.8 \pm 0.3$ s<sup>-1</sup> at 35.0&#176;C) reflecting the involvement of proton coupled electron transfer mechanism in the latter case. A computational study of the structure optimization of the complexes, trans-Mn<sup>III</sup>(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)$^+_2$, trans-MnIII(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)(Gl), and <i>trans</i>- Mn<sup>III</sup>(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)(HGl)<sup>+</sup> (all high spin Mn<sup>III</sup>(d<sup>4</sup>) systems), reveals strongest axial distortion for the (aqua)(Gl) complex ; HGl bound to Mn<sup>III</sup> centre by the C=O function of the carboxyl group in the (aqua)(HGl) complex facilitates the formation of a hydrogen bond between the proton of the carboxyl group and the coordinated phenoxide moiety ((O-H‚Ä¶O hydrogen bond distance 1.745 &#197;) and the gem-diols are not involved in H-bonding in either case. A rate comparison for the second order paths: Mn<sup>III</sup>(salen)(OH<sub>2</sub>)(HGl)/Gl)<sup>+/0</sup> + HGl/Gl<sup>‚àí</sup> ‚Üí products, shows that HGl for the (aqua)(HGl) complex is a better reducing agent than Gl<sup>‚àí</sup> for the (aqua)(Gl) complex ($k_{\text{HG}} \tilde 5 k_{\text{Gl}}$). The high values of activation enthalpy (ùõ•H$^\neq$ = 93-119 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) are indicative of substantial reorganization of the bonds as expected for inner-sphere ET process.</p>

				<title>Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nano-sized crystals: Rapid synthesis and extension to preparation of nanosized LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> materials</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0561-0567</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With a novel gas-liquid reaction, a facile and rapid method has been successfully developed for the synthesis of nano-sized Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> crystals. Coupled with complementary experiments, preparation mechanisms of Mn(II) and Mn(III)Mn(III)Mn(II) coordination complexes as well as nano-sized Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> crystals are studied. Besides, as the extension of synthesis of nano-sized Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> crystals, the intermediate ammonia alkaline solution containing Mn(III)Mn(III)Mn(II) coordination complexes, which tend to decompose into nano-sized Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> crystals spontaneously, are used to prepare nanosized LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> materials. Although any physical treatment has been done to disperse powders, the as-synthesized LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles are still existence with homogeneous size distribution (about 24.2 nm) without any obvious agglomeration. That is to say, the novel method is constructive not only to accelerate reaction rates for the elevated oxidation state of manganese ions, but also to prepare dispersed nanosized LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> materials with good electrochemical properties.</p>

				<title>Investigating the interactions of the enantiomers of phenylglycine with nanopores of ZSM-5 zeolite</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0569-0578</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, molecular dynamics simulation has been used to investigate the interactions of both chiral forms of phenylglycine amino acid (R- and S-isomers) with micropores of ZSM5-zeolite. Calculated results show that phenylglycine molecules interact with zeolite surface by electrostatic interaction of their positively charged ammonium group and negatively charged carboxylic group. This leads to the formation of two hetero hydrogen bonds between amino groups and oxygen of zeolite framework and also one hydrogen bond between the carboxylic groups and the zeolite surface. Further analyses show that S-isomers have stronger interactions with zeolite surface in comparison to R-isomers. So, movement, radius of gyration and angle of orientation of S-isomers inside nanopores are decreased, while R-isomers interact more strongly with each other. However, both chiral forms have diffusive behaviour along the pores with the self diffusion coefficient of about two orders of magnitude less than that in free water.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A low dielectric constant hyperbranched epoxy thermoset with excellent adhesive and mechanical strength is the demand for advanced electronics and engineering applications. The present investigation provided a room temperature, curable hyperbranched epoxy, obtained by an A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>3</sub> polycondensation reaction. The synthesized hyperbranched epoxy was cured by a combined hardener system consisting of a commercial poly(amido-amine) and a first generation aliphatic poly(amido-amine) dendrimer (PAD) prepared by Michael addition reaction of methyl acrylate and aliphatic amines. The thermoset exhibited high mechanical strength, excellent adhesive strength, low dielectric constant, good thermal stability and excellent weather resistance along with very good moisture resistance. The results showed the influence of the amount of PAD on the performance of the thermoset. Thus, the study revealed that the combined poly(amido-amine) cured hyperbranched epoxy has high potential in advanced electrical packaging and microelectronic devices.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polymer-clay nanocomposites were synthesized by solution polymerization method using advanced functionalized clay and vinyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride as monomer. First stage consisted in the silylation of a commercial organo-modified clay-Cl 20A using alkoxysilanes with different chain lengths. In the second step, the synthesis and characterization of polymer-nanocomposites were followed. To evaluate the clay functionalization process as well as the final polymer-clay products, thermogravimetric,X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and three test liquid contact angles analyses were used. The loss of ammonium ions from commercial clay, the grafting degree, the lengths and the nature of alkyl chain influence the dispersion of the advanced modified clay into the polymer solution and, furthermore, the properties of the final polymer-clay nanocomposite film.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrocatalytic activity of Ag-doped lanthanum chromites electrode materials viz., LaCr<sub>0.4</sub>Ag<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and LaCr<sub>0.7</sub>Ag<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> prepared by decomposing the precursor complex is studied. Pure LaCrO<sub>3</sub> is synthesized by combustion route using oxalic acid as a fuel. The decomposition behaviour of the assynthesized powder obtained in the latter method is characterized by TGA-DTA and XRD. Both the precursor complex and the as-synthesized powder are calcined at 900&#176;C for 7 and 10 h, respectively. XRD of the final product after calcinations indicated the formation of perovskite phase with minor amounts of impurity phases of component oxides in the Ag-doped lanthanum chromites and pure perovskite phase in the undoped one. The surface morphology of the perovskites is studied by SEM. The electrocatalytic activity of the perovskite powders for borohydride oxidation is studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a catalyst loading of 0.7 mgcm<sup>‚àí2</sup> for both Ag-doped and undoped LaCrO<sub>3</sub> coated on glassy carbon substrate. Calibration plots are obtained by plotting the anodic peak current versus concentration of borohydride in the range of 20-100 mM. The sensitivities of the three perovskites towards borohydride oxidation indicated that LaCr<sub>0.4</sub>Ag<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is the best among all the perovskites studied giving a value of 1.395 ùúáA/mM.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Calixarene functionalized gold nanoparticles (CFAuNPs) have been prepared and characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic (TEM) techniques. To use this material as potential colorimetric sensor, the binding property of this new material has been investigated with a large number of metal ions. It exhibited sharp colour change from dark brown to green and blue, detectable by naked-eye, in the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions, respectively. It has also triggered substantial change in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of the functionalized gold nanoparticles, which in case of Pb(II) is due to the inter particle plasmon coupling arising from the metal-induced aggregation of the nanoparticles and for Cu(II), it is because of the formation of AuCu alloy due to anti-galvanic exchange. The size and aggregation of the nanoparticles are confirmed from HRTEM images, elemental analysis and the line profiling for both the metal ions have been done by STEM-EDX analysis.</p>

				<title>Molecular dynamics simulations and free energy profile of Paracetamol in DPPC and DMPC lipid bilayers</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0637-0647</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biased MD simulation were carried out for the neutral form of Paracetamol inserted in fully hydrated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipid bilayers. For comparison, fully hydrated DMPC and DPPC lipid bilayers were also simulated separately without Paracetamol. The simulation time for each system was 50 ns. At two concentrations of Paracetamol, various properties of the lipid bilayer such as area per lipid, order parameter, diffusion coefficient, radial distribution function, electrostatic potential, mass density and hydrogen bonds have been calculated. Also, the convergence in time of the free energy profile of the Paracetamol along a DPPC bilayer normal was calculated by umbrella sampling method. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that neutral form of Paracetamol shows a generally similar behaviour in DPPC and DMPC lipid bilayers. It was shown that the addition of Paracetamol causes a decrease in tail order parameter of both DPPC and DMPC lipid bilayers and the tail of Paracetamol adopts an inward orientation in the lipid bilayers. Also from the free energy profile, the high penetration barrier in the bilayer centre was determined.</p>

				<title>Molecular dynamics simulation on the interaction mechanism between polymer inhibitors and calcium phosphate</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0649-0658</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Investigation on the microscopic interaction between polymer inhibitors and calcium phosphate contributes to the understanding of their scale inhibition mechanism. The results obtained may provide a theoretical guidance to developing new scale inhibitors. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to simulate the interaction between hydrolyzed polymaleic anhydride (HPMA), polyaspartic acid (PASP), polyepoxysuccinic acid (PESA), polyacrylic acid (PAA) and the (001) and (110) surfaces of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystal with and without water. Results show that the simulations of polymer inhibitors and the (001) surface of HA with water is closer to the actual situation. On the same HA (001), binding energy of four polymer inhibitors with water has the order of HPMA &#62; PASP &#62; PESA &#62; PAA. On the different surface of HA, the binding energy does not vary much between the same polymer and the two surfaces of HA. But, deformation energies of the same polymer with and without water vary widely. Pair correlation function of Ca (HA)-O (-C=O) implies that the Ca-O bonds formed between the calcium atoms of HA crystal and oxygen atoms of the carboxyl groups in polymers, and water molecules change the distances between polymer inhibitors and HA crystal. The system of polymer-HA is mainly contributed by the non-bond interaction. Polymer inhibitors do not interact directly with HA crystal, but indirectly through the interactions between inhibitor-H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O-HA. Water molecules cannot be ignored when the interaction models are constructed, i.e., solvent effect must be considered.</p>

				<page>0659-0675</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we explore the use of stochastic optimizer, namely simulated annealing (SA) followed by density function theory (DFT)-based strategy for evaluating the structure and infrared spectroscopy of (H<sub>2</sub>O)$_n$ OH<sup>‚àí</sup> clusters where ùëõ = 1-6. We have shown that the use of SA can generate both global and local structures of these cluster systems.We also perform a DFT calculation, using the optimized coordinate obtained from SA as input and extract the IR spectra of these systems. Finally, we compare our results with available theoretical and experimental data. There is a close correspondence between the computed frequencies from our theoretical study and available experimental data. To further aid in understanding the details of the hydrogen bonds formed, we performed atoms in molecules calculation on all the global minimum structures to evaluate relevant electron densities and critical points.</p>

				<title>Chemical reaction due to stronger Ramachandran interaction</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0677-0689</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The origin of a chemical reaction between two reactant atoms is associated with the activation energy, on the assumption that, high-energy collisions between these atoms, are the ones that overcome the activation energy. Here, we show that a stronger attractive van der Waals (vdW) and electron-ion Coulomb interactions between two polarized atoms are responsible for initiating a chemical reaction, either before or after the collision. We derive this stronger vdW attraction formula exactly using the quasi one-dimensional Drude model within the ionization energy theory and the energy-level spacing renormalization group method. Along the way, we expose the precise physical mechanism responsible for the existence of a stronger vdW interaction for both long and short distances, and also show how to technically avoid the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion between polarized electrons from these two reactant atoms. Finally, we properly and correctly associate the existence of this stronger attraction with Ramachandran‚Äôs `normal limits‚Äô (distance shorter than what is allowed by the standard vdW bond) between chemically nonbonded atoms.</p>

				<title>Ring opening of monocyclic dimethyl cyclopropene via metathesis by tungsten catalyst- A computational study</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0691-0700</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metathesis reaction of 3,3-disubstituted cyclopropene mediated by the model catalyst tungsten alkylidene W(NH)(CH<sub>2</sub>)(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> has been studied at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level of theory. The stationary points on the potential energy surface for ring opening metathesis were calculated considering all stereochemically distinct approaches of the 3,3-disubstituted cyclopropene to the model tungsten catalyst. The ring opening of cyclopropene moiety proceeds in two steps i.e., cycloaddition and ring opening. Each step involves a twisted trigonal bipyramidal transition structure. The syn orientation of cyclopropene to the NH group of the tungsten alkylidene is more favourable for product formation. Cyclopropene addition to tungsten alkylidene takes place preferentially on the CNO face; which is favoured by 10.89 kcal/mol over the COO face. The energy barriers for the <i>syn</i> cycloaddition and syn ring opening steps are 8.47 and 10.94 kcal/mol, respectively. The ring opening step is the rate determining step for the reaction of cyclopropene with tungsten catalyst, in contrast with the case of the molybdenum catalyst.</p>

				<title>Second harmonic generation and electro-optical Pockels effect of 1-and 3-nitro-6-azabenzo[ùëé]pyrene N-oxide isomers: A Hartree-Fock and Coulomb-attenuating density functional theory investigation</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0701-0710</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Structural, energetic, spectroscopic, linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the environmental mutagens 1- and 3-nitro-6-azabenzo[ùëé]pyrene ùëÅ-oxides were characterized by means of Hartree-Fock as well as B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP density functional theory computations. The NLO investigations were performed for the second harmonic generation (SHG) and electro-optical Pockels effect (EOPE) at the incident wavelength of 1064 nm. The results show that, the predicted structures, vibrational spectra, nucleus independent chemical shifts, ionization energy, electron affinity as well as electronic polarizabilities are little influenced by the position of the nitro substituent. Differently, the dipole moment (ùúá) and the first-order hyperpolarizabilities ($\beta_\mu$) are significantly dependent on the isomerization. The rather different mutagenic activity of the investigated isomers could be related to their diverse polarity. At the CAM-B3LYP level, when passing from the 1- to the 3-nitro-6-azabenzo[a]pyrene ùëÅ-oxide isomer, the ùúá datum increases by about 5 D (a factor of three), whereas the static and dynamic $\beta_\mu$ values decrease by ca. 50&#37;. Dipole moment measurement and SHG and EOPE NLO techniques are potentially useful to distinguish these important environmental mutagens.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new chitosan-based Schiff base was prepared and complexed with manganese, cobalt and copper. These Schiff base metal complexes were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the air oxidation of ùõΩ-isophorone to ketoisophorone. The obtained complexes were characterized by means of FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, field emission gun scanning electron microscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, ICP-AES and solubility tests. Thermal properties were also investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis. Data obtained by thermal analysis revealed that these complexes showed good thermal stability. The conversion and selectivity of ùõΩ-isophorone to ketoisophorone for each prepared catalyst was studied using a batch reactor and gas chromatography for product identification and quantification. The results were compared against the homogeneous <i>bis</i>-salicylaldehyde ethylenedi-imine-Mn catalyst. The use of methanol, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone and ùëõ-hexane as solvent and its effect on conversion and selectivity was also investigated. Acetone was found to be a promising solvent for the ùõΩ-isophorone oxidation. The role of triethyl amine and acetyl acetone in the oxidation reaction has also been investigated.</p>

					<p>The apo-Calfumirin-1 (CAF-1) binds to Ca<sup>2+</sup> with high affinity and also to Mg<sup>2+</sup> with high positive cooperativity. The thermal unfolding curves of wtCAF-1 monitored at neutral pH by CD spectroscopy are reversible and show different thermal stabilities in the absence or presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Metalfree wtCAF-1 shows greater thermal stability than EF-IV mutant protein. We observed that GdnHCl-induced unfolding of apo-wtCAF-1 monitored by CD and fluorescence spectroscopies increases co-operative folding with approximately same C$_m$ values. Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to CAF-1 dramatically altered the fluorescence and CD spectra, indicating metal ion-induced conformational changes both in the wild-type and mutant proteins. The hydrophobic probe, ANS is used to observe alteration in surface hydrophobicity of the protein in different ligation states. In apo-wtCAF-1, the exposed hydrophobic surfaces are able to bind ANS which is in contrast to the unfolded or the metal ions ligated conformations. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) resultsshow two possible independent binding sites of comparable affinity for the metal ions. However, their binding to the EF-IV E helix-loop-F helix mutant apo-protein happens with different affinities. The present study demonstrates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding plays a possible role in the conformational stability of the protein.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two dinuclear mercury(II) iodide complexes of the types [(L1)Hg(ùúá-I)HgI<sub>3</sub>] (<b>1</b>) and [Hg<sub>2</sub>(L2) (I)<sub>4</sub>]¬∑H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>2</b>) [L1 = <i>tris</i>(2-aminoethyl)amine and L2 = N,N'-(<i>bis</i>-(pyridin-2-yl)benzylidene)diethylenetriamine] have been synthesized and characterized usingmicroanalytical, spectroscopic, thermal and other physicochemical results. Structures of both the compounds are solved by X-ray diffraction measurements. Structural analyses show that one mercury (II) centre in <b>1</b> adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry with an HgI<sub>4</sub> chromophore surrounded by four iodides, while the other has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal environment with an HgN<sub>4</sub>I chromophore bound by four N atoms of L1 and one bridging iodide. Pentadentate Schiff base (L2) in <b>2</b> shows unusual binucleating <i>bis</i>(bidentate) behaviour to bind two different mercury(II) centres‚ÄîHg1 with an HgN<sub>3</sub>I<sub>2</sub> chromophore in a distorted square pyramidal geometry and Hg2 with an HgN<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> chromophore in a tetrahedral environment. Weak intermolecularN-H‚Ä¶I hydrogen bonds in <b>1</b> and cooperative C-H$\ldots$ùúã and $\pi\ldots \pi$ interactions in <b>2</b> promote dimensionalities. The Schiff base complex, <b>2</b>, shows intraligand ($\pi-\pi^\ast$) fluorescence in DMF solution at room temperature, whereas compound <b>1</b> containing tripodal amine is fluorescent-inactive.</p>

				<page>0771-0781</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hetero-metallic trigonal cage-shaped dimeric Ni<sub>3</sub>K core complex of L-proline ligand has been synthesized and characterized. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the hetero-metallic Ni(II)-K(I) complex has a dimeric structure with nine coordinated potassium atoms and six coordinated nickel atoms. The cyclic voltammograms of the complex exhibited two successive quasireversible reduction waves at ($E^1_{pc} = ‚àí1.02$ V and $E^2_{pc}  = ‚àí1.33$ V) and two successive irreversible oxidation waves ($E^1_{pa} = 0.95$ V and $E^2_{pa} = 1.45$ V) versus Ag/AgCl in DMF solution. Interaction of the complex with calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) has been studied using spectroscopic techniques. The complex is an avid DNA binder with a binding constant of $3.6 \times 10^8$ M<sup>-1</sup>. The complex showed efficient oxidative cleavage of supercoiled pBR322 DNA in the presence of the reducing agent hydrogen peroxide involving hydroxyl radical (&#176;OH) species. As evidenced from the control experiment, DNA cleavage in the presence of &#176;OH radical was inhibited by quenchers, viz. DMSO and KI. The complex showed <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial activity against four bacteria and two fungi and the activity is greater than that of the free ligand.</p>

				<title>Mixed-ligand binuclear copper(II) complex of 5-methylsalicylaldehyde and 2,2'-bipyridyl: Synthesis, crystal structure, DNA binding and nuclease activity</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new mixed-ligand binuclear copper(II) complex [Cu(MS)(bpy)]<sub>2</sub>.(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, built of 5-methylsalicylaldehyde and 2,2'-bipyridyl has been synthesized and characterized by using elemental analysis, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Crystal structure of the complex shows that copper(II) ion lies in a square pyramidal coordination environment. The structure consists of two symmetrical half units in which the copper(II) ion of one half unit connected with the phenolate oxygen atom of other half unit along with one perchlorate anion in the crystal lattice as free molecule. Presence of uncoordinated perchlorate anion was also confirmed by IR spectroscopy. Absorption spectroscopy exhibits d-d transition at 628 nm, which further supports the square pyramidal geometry around the copper(II) ions. EPR spectrum of the copper(II) complex at room temperature shows a broad signal without any splitting pattern at $g_{||} = 2.26$, $g_\perp = 2.03$ and the magnetic moment ($\mu_{\text{eff}} = 1.31$ BM) obtained at room temperature indicate an antiferromagnetic interaction between the two copper(II) ions through phenoxide-bridge. Binding studies reveal that the complex possesses good binding propensity ($K_b = 5.2 \pm 1.7\times 10^4$ M<sup>-1</sup>) and bind to nitrogenous bases of DNA through intercalation. Nuclease activity of the complex with pBR322 DNA shows that the effect of hydrolytic cleavage is dose-dependent and the oxidative cleavage indicates the involvement of hydroxyl radical and singlet-oxygen as reactive oxygen species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of Fe(III) Schiff base complexes immobilized on MCM-41 were prepared and characterized by various physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. The complexes were used for oxidation of cyclohexene by 30&#37; hydrogen peroxide in the presence and absence of ethylmethyl imidazolium chloride (EMIM) ionic liquid as solvent. The immobilized complexes proved to be effective catalysts and generally exhibited much higher catalytic performance than their homogeneous analogue. Catalytic performance of the complexes was also found to be closely related to the Schiff base ligands used. Additionally, ion liquid solvent efficiently improved all the catalytic performances. Finally, the reaction was extended to different alkenes using the heterogeneous complex 2-L<sub>4</sub>. Among all the alkenes, those containing ùúã-electron-withdrawing groups and <i>trans</i>-orientations exhibited lower tendency for oxidation.</p>

A biomimetic oxidative coupling of the ferulic acid methyl ester in the presence of silver oxide is the crucial step in the synthesis sequence, generating the dihydrobenzofuran skeleton. Hydroxyl group was protected with DHP and reducted with LiAlH<sub>4</sub> to afford the intermediate diol. The diol was condensated with the derivative of ferulic acid, then removed the protecting groups, to get Boehmenan. Meanwhile, a study on the ring-opening reaction of the intermediate dihydrobenzofuran neolignan under base conditions was described.</p>

				<title>Symmetrical trimeric star-shaped mesogens based on 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene incorporating Schiff base and azobenzene fragments as the peripheral units: Synthesis and mesomorphic properties</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0847-0859</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two series of symmetrical three-armed star-shaped mesogens based on 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene as a core unit, interconnecting three Schiff base or azobenzene moieties via oxymethylene spacers have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Every member in these series possesses either chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) terminal atom, with different alkyl spacer length (C$_n$H$_{2n}$ whereby ùëõ ranging from 3 to 6). Their thermal stability and mesomorphic properties are investigated by employing DSC and POM. The dependence of phase transition in relation to the alkyl spacer length is shown by both series. These star-shaped mesogens exhibit only nematic and smectic phases. The difference between the two series lies on the structure of linking group in the peripheral units (-CH=N- for series <b>PSB-X</b>-<b>ùëõ</b> and -N=N- for series <b>PAZ-X</b>-<b>n</b>). Therefore, a comparison study of the mesomorphic properties between these two series of star-shaped mesogens is discussed whereby the azobenzene-basedmesogens are thermally more stable than the Schiff base counterpart. In addition, soft crystalline phase is observed for the azobenzene-based star-shaped mesogens possessing hexyl alkyl spacer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The thermal decomposition of 1-chloropropane in argon was studied behind reflected shock waves in a single pulse shock tube over the temperature range of 1015-1220 K. The reaction mainly goes through unimolecular elimination of HCl. The major products observed in the decomposition are propylene and ethylene, while the minor products identified are methane and propane. The rate constant for HCl elimination in the studied temperature range is estimated to be k(1015-1220 K) = $1.63 \times 10^{13}$exp(-($60.1 \pm 1.0$) kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>/RT) s<sup>-1</sup>. The DFT calculations were carried out to identify the transition state(s) for the major reaction channel; and rate coefficient for this reaction is obtained to be k(800-1500 K) = $5.01 \times 10^{14}$exp(-(58.8) kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>/RT) s<sup>-1</sup>. The results are compared with the experimental findings.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Interaction between meso-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinyl)porphyrin (TMPyP) and single strand DNA homopolymers, (dA)<sub>40</sub>, (dT)<sub>40</sub>, (dG)<sub>40</sub> and (dC)<sub>40</sub>, has been investigated using absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. Fluorescence intensity of TMPyP is quenched in the presence of (dG)<sub>40</sub> due to photo-induced electron transfer from dG to the excited TMPyP dye. Changes in the CD spectra of the polynucleotides in the presence of TMPyP are found to be quite different and depend on the nature of the nucleotide bases, whether purine or pyrimidine. Excitonic induced CD spectra is observed for TMPyP in the presence of pyrimidine homopolymers while negative induced CD is observed in the presence of purine homopolymers. Based on photophysical studies and CD spectra, we propose multiple binding modes of TMPyP with polynucleotides. TMPyP can bind to oligonucleotides both in monomer form as well as in the form of short stretches of stacked aggregates along the oligonucleotide backbone.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The intramolecular hydrogen bonding (IHB) in a series of 3-, 4- and 5-substituted 2-hydroxybenzophenone (HBP) is studied using density functional theory calculations. All calculations are performed at the B3LYP level, using 6-311++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> basis set. To understand the substitution effects on the nature of IHB and the electronic structure of the chelated ring system, the vibrational frequencies, <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift, topological parameters, natural bond orders and natural charges over atoms involved in the chelated ring of HBP and its derivatives were calculated. TheWiberg bond indices and the natural charges over atoms involved in the chelated ring have been computed using the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. The computations were further complemented with an atoms-in-molecules (AIM) topological analysis to characterize the nature of the IHB in the considered molecules. Several correlations between geometrical parameters, <sup>1</sup>H NMR chemical shift and topological parameters with the IHB strength are obtained.</p>

				<title>Interaction of cyclodextrins with human and bovine serum albumins: A combined spectroscopic and computational investigation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0931-0944</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Interaction of cyclodextrins (CDs) with the two most abundant proteins, namely human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), has been investigated using steady-state and time-resolved fluorometric techniques, circular dichroism measurements and molecular docking simulation. The study reveals that the three CDs interact differently on the fluorescence and fluorescence lifetimes of the serum albumins. However, fluorescence anisotropy and circular dichroism are not affected. Depending on their size, different CDs bind to the serum albumins in different positions, resulting in changes in the spectral behaviour of the proteins. Docking study suggests the probable binding sites of the three CDs with the proteins. Combined experimental and computational studies imply that sufficiently high concentration of CDs causes loosening of the rigid structures of these transport proteins, although their secondary structures remain intact. Thus, CDs are found to be safe for the serum proteins from the structural point of view.</p>

				<page>0945-0954</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tris-(2,2'-bipyridine)-nickel-(II) complex ion encapsulated by zeolite-Y host has been synthesized by ship-in-a-bottle method. Photosensitization of nickel(II) complex (Ni(bpy)$^{2+}_3$) in the zeolite host by surface adsorbed phenosafranine dye was investigated by time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectral measurements. Formation of nickel (II)-complex in the super cage of the host was ascertained by XRD, FTIR, solidstate NMR, diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption spectroscopic techniques and ICP-OES measurements. Phenosafranine dye adsorbed on the external surface of zeolite-Y shows a decrease in fluorescence intensity with increased loading of the nickel(II) complex in zeolite-Y. Time-resolved emission studies show two excited state lifetimes for the photoexcited phenosafranine dye. Average fluorescence lifetimes of the dye in this case do not change with increase in the loading of the nickel(II) complex. However, relative contribution of short lifetime component increases when the amount of encapsulated nickel(II) complex is increased. The zeolite-Y host containing only bipyridyl ligand shows a marked decrease in fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence lifetimes of the dye however do not change with increased loading of bipyridyl while relative contribution of short lifetime component increases with an increase in the loading of bipyridyl in the host. This observation is interpreted to be due to electron transfer from the excited state of phenosafranine dye to the bipyridine. Picosecond pump-probe investigations confirm that the photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the surfaceadsorbed phenosafranine in the excited state to the nickel(II) complex within zeolite-Y cavity and also to the Ni(bpy)$^{2+}_3$ complex in contact with the phenosafranine dye co-adsorbed on the external surface of the host.</p>

Its molecular geometry in the ground state has also been calculated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> level and compared with its crystal structure. Results show that the optimized geometry can well reproduce the crystal structure.

					<p>Anion-doped cadmium sulphide nanomaterials have been synthesized by using combustionmethod at normal atmospheric conditions. Oxidant/fuel ratios have been optimized in order to obtain CdS with best characteristics. Formation of CdS and size of crystallite were identified by X-ray diffraction and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of C and N in the CdS matrix. The observed enhanced photocatalytic activity of the CdS nanomaterials for the hydrogen production from water (2120 ùúámol/h) can be attributed to high crystallinity, low band gap and less exciton recombination due to the C and N doping.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>ùúÜ‚àíZirconium phosphate adipate dimethyl sulphoxide, ùúÜ-ZrPO<sub>4</sub>(OOC-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>-COOH)(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO, is prepared by means of topotactic anion exchange of the chloride ligand of ùúÜ-Zirconium phosphate, ùúÜ-ZrPO<sub>4</sub>Cl(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO, with adipate. The samples are characterized by thermal analyses, X-ray diffractometry and FT-IR spectrophotometry. The used analysis approaches provide strong evidence that the chloride monovalent anions of ùúÜ-Zirconium phosphate are completely exchanged with the carboxylate groups of the adipate monoanionic ligands. Moreover, the adipate ligands replace the chloride anions in a 1:1 stoichiometry. In this case the formula of the derivative should contain the monoanionic adipate fragment: (OOC-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>-COOH). This formula is in agreement with TGA and elemental analysis. With respect to intercalation properties, the synthesized adipate-solid phase has a higher acidic character and a larger gallery height in comparison to the pristine ùúÜ-Zirconium phosphate (1.47, 1.02 nm, respectively). Therefore, this material is expected to be a suitable host for intercalation of huge basic guests.</p>

				<title>Carbon monoxide oxidation using Zn-Cu-Ti hydrotalcite-derived catalysts</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0981-0988</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multioxide catalysts of zinc, copper and titanium with different ratios obtained from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors were used in the oxidation of carbon monoxide. The catalysts were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, thermal analyses (TG, DTG and DTA) and scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction showed different phases of double hydroxide structures. On increasing the percentage of zinc, hydrotalcite structure became the main phase in these samples. SEM images confirmed the presence of layered double hydroxide as plate-like structure. Experimental results indicated a sharp increase in the catalytic activities of the calcined samples towards the oxidation of carbon monoxide at temperatures in the range of 225-275&#176;C. High conversion of carbon monoxide (90 ‚àº 95&#37;) was achieved at reaction temperature of 275&#176;C by samples having ZnTiO<sub>3</sub> as a main phase. These results suggested that hydrotalcite structure of Zn-Ti has a positive catalytic effect towards carbon monoxide oxidation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The nanoparticles of NiO supported on mesoporous MCM-41 were synthesized and characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this study, catalytic activities of the supported NiO nanoparticles for oxidation of cyclohexene to 2-cyclohexene-1-ol and 2-cyclohexene-1-one with air in the gas phase were considered. These nanoparticles of NiO supported on mesoporous MCM-41 were effective catalysts in a temperature range of 220-310&#176;C at 1 atm of air. Under these reaction conditions, the activity of the catalysts decreases in the following order: 5 wt.&#37; NiO/MCM-41 &#62; 7.5 wt.&#37; NiO/MCM-41 &#62; 2.5 wt.&#37; NiO/MCM-41. With 5 wt.&#37; NiO supported on mesoporous MCM-41 and under our experimental conditions, the conversion percent of cyclohexene is 62.3&#37; with 65.9&#37; selectivity of 2-cyclohexene-1-ol + 2-cyclohexene-1-one and 12.2&#37; cyclohexadiene at 280&#176;C. To achieve higher conversion of cyclohexene and better selectivity towards 2-cyclohexene-1-ol + 2-cyclohexene-1-one, factors such as reaction temperature, loading amount of nickel oxide and space velocity were studied, and optimized conditions were investigated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Based on a sol-gel procedure, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) was synthesized, using phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMOS), aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) as monomers and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as cross-linking agent. In addition to the amount of the template, some factors in the sol-gel process: TEOS/APTES/PTMOS molar ratio, H<sub>2</sub>O/Si molar ratio, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH/Si molar ratio, etc. were investigated in detail. Results show that the optimum conditions for the preparation of the MIPs were 20:1.5:1 (TEOS: APTES: PTMOS), ca. 4 (H<sub>2</sub>O/Si), ca. 4 (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH/Si), respectively. Effects of various parameters involved in the adsorption process of 2, 4-D on MIP such as incubation time, pH, etc. were also evaluated. It is found that the adsorption attained equilibrium within 3 h, the optimum pH for adsorption was about 7 and the adsorption obeyed Langmuir model. Test results also demonstrated that the present MIP for 2, 4-D had large adsorption capacity (the maximum adsorption concluded from Langmuir model reached 243.3 mg/g) and good selectivity.</p>

				<title>The direct transformation of ethanol to ethyl acetate over Cu/SiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts that contain copper phyllosilicate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1013-1020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cu/SiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts that contain copper phyllosilicate, were successfully prepared using the ammonia-evaporation method. The catalysts were characterized via XRD, ICP, BET, FTIR, TPR, XPS, NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD and FTIR of Pyridine Adsorption techniques. The results demonstrated that the formation of the copper phyllosilicate species significantly affected the structural properties and caused the CuO nanoparticles to become highly dispersed, and the copper phyllosilicate would provide access to the Lewis acidic Cu<sup>+</sup> species. It was found that the catalyst with a 23.7 wt&#37; copper loading exhibited the best ethanol conversion and ethyl acetate selectivity. When compared to a catalyst with the same copper loading which was prepared with the impregnation method, the higher activity and selectivity of catalysts might be ascribed to the homogenous distribution of copper nanoparticles, which was the active site for the dehydrogenation, and the amount of Lewis acidic Cu<sup>+</sup> sites active for esterification. The synergetic effect between the Cu<sup>0</sup> and Lewis acidic sites was the key factor to achieve direct transformation of ethanol to ethyl acetate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple procedure for the voltammetric detection of the DNA damage using a disposable electrochemical DNA biosensor is reported. The DNA biosensor is assembled by immobilizing the double stranded calf thymus DNA (dsDNA) on the surface of a disposable carbon screen-printed electrode. The interaction of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) with calf thymus dsDNA was studied electrochemically based on the oxidation signals of guanine (G) and adenine (A) by using square wave voltammetry (SWV) at screen printed electrode (SPE). The oxidation signals of the guanine and adenine bases, obtained by a square wave voltammetric scan, were used as analytical signal to detect the DNA damage. The presence of this aromatic amine compound with affinity for nucleic acids was measured by its effect on the guanine and adenine oxidation peaks. The response was obtained in the range of 0.05-20 mg L<sup>-1</sup> for 2-AA concentration on dsDNA-modified SPE. This test has been used due to its rapid, easy handling and cost effective responses for the toxicity assessment in real water and bleach solution samples.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Regioselective synthesis of a series of 1,4-disubstituted of naphthoxymethyl-N-alkyl naphthalimide-1,2,3-triazoles employing click reaction is presented. Highly selective and efficient copper(I)-catalysed 1,3-dipolar cyclo addition between 1-naphthylpropargylic ether and azido alkyl naphthalimides yielded the title compounds in 74&#37; to 94&#37;. The structure of all the new 1,2,3-triazoles was characterized by <sup>1</sup>HNMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, IR and Mass. The electronic absorption and emission studies revealed that the light absorbing and emitting chromophore is the naphthoxy moiety. There is no extensive delocalization of aromatic œÄ-electrons in the active chromophore which exhibited lower quantum yields and lower Stokes shifts.</p>

					<p>A simple and mild procedure for the synthesis of different naphthopyrans providing high yields in a short reaction time was reported. The reaction of propargylic alcohols with ùõº- or ùõΩ-naphthol and dihydroxy naphthalenes in the presence of montmorillonite K-10 was studied. This reaction afforded high yields of the corresponding naphthopyrans.

				<title>Syntheses, characterization, and anti-cancer activities of pyridine-amide based compounds containing appended phenol or catechol groups</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1091-1105</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several pyridine-amide compounds appended with phenol/catechol groups are synthesized. These compounds consist of protected or deprotected phenol/catechol groups and offer pyridine, amide, and phenol/catechol functional groups. All compounds have been well-characterized by various spectroscopic methods, elemental analysis, thermal studies, and crystallography. The biological activities of all compounds were investigated while a few compounds significantly decreased the metabolic viability, growth and clonogenicity of T98G cells in dose dependent manner. Accumulation of ROS was observed in T98G cells, which displayed a compromised redox status as evident from increased cellular Caspase 3/7 activity and formation of micronuclei. The <i>in silico</i> pharmacokinetic studies suggest that all compounds have good bioavailability, water solubility and other drug-like parameters. A few compounds were identified as the lead molecules for future investigation due to their: (a) high activity against T98G brain, H-460 lung, and SNU-80 thyroid cancer cells; (b) low cytotoxicity in non-malignant HEK and MRC-5 cells; (c) low toxic risks based on <i>in silico</i> evaluation; (d) good theoretical oral bioavailability according to Lipinski ‚Äòrule of five‚Äô pharmacokinetic parameters; and (e) better drug-likeness and drug-score values.</p>

				<title>ùëÅ-Phenyl heteroarylamine analogues of fluazinam using the intermediate derivatization methods approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1107-1114</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Twenty-one N-phenyl heteroarylamine analogues of fluazinam 3a-3u were prepared via nucleophilic substitution reaction of 2,6-dichloro-3,5-dinitrotoluene with heteroarylamines using the intermediate derivatization method. 2,6-Dichloro-3,5-dinitrotoluene, the key intermediate, was synthesized by nitration of 2,6-dichlorotoluene. The synthesized compounds were identified by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, MS and elemental analyses. Preliminary bioassays indicated that most of the compounds showed good fungicidal activity against rice blast. The activity of 3p was equal to that of fluazinam. The relationship between molecular structure and biological activity suggested that introduction of electron-withdrawing groups in the pyridine ring was important for optimizing fungicidal activity against rice blast.</p>

The mode of interaction of <b>1</b> with calf thymus- DNA and with protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated by using absorption and emission spectroscopic tools. The apparent association constant of complex <b>1</b> with CT-DNA was deduced from an absorption spectral study ($K_b = 4.08 \times 10^4$ M<sup>-1</sup>). Spectral and viscosity measurements indicated a groove-binding mode of <b>1</b> with CT-DNA, and from spectroscopic study the formation of a metal complex-BSA adduct was assumed to be the result of the interaction of <b>1</b> with BSA.</p>

The reaction of alcohol with Lawesson reagent produced neutral product (<b>I</b>) while that with amines led to an ion pair (<b>II</b>, <b>III</b>). Furthermore, reaction of <b>I</b>, <b>II</b> and <b>III</b> with NiCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O in methanol produced novel complexes: <b>IV</b>, <b>V</b> and <b>VI</b>. The compounds were characterized by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>31</sup>P NMR, IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The single crystal X-ray structures of <b>IV</b> and <b>V</b> showed that the nickel complexes are square planar. Compound V formed a three-dimensional supramolecular structure via intermolecular P-O‚Ä¶H-N hydrogen bonds. The Xray crystallography of <b>V</b> showed that those three hydrogens of <sup>+</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> cation produced three hydrogen bonds with different distances.

The stoichiometry of the complexed species was found to be 2:1. The fluorescence quenching with Cu<sup>2+</sup> is in the order of <b>L<sub>1</sub></b> &#62; <b>L<sub>2</sub></b> &#62; <b>L<sub>3</sub></b>. These conjugates were also found to act as colorimetric sensors for Cu<sup>2+</sup> in solution by exhibiting visual colour change.

				<feature />
				<page>1153-1161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two new complexes of Mn(II) and Zn(II) have been synthesized using a mixed ligand system and characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single crystal x-ray diffraction and variable temperature magnetic study for one of the compounds. Dimeric coordination structures of [Mn<sub>2</sub>(2,4-pyrdc)<sub>2</sub>(bpe)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]¬∑2H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>1</b>) and [Zn<sub>2</sub>(2,4-pyrdc)<sub>2</sub>(azpy)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]¬∑2H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>2</b>) [2,4-pyrdc = 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylate; bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane; azpy = 4, 4' azopyridine] are constructed by the bridging of bpe and azpy, respectively and both are extended to a 3D supramolecular structure by non-covalent interactions. In both the cases, unprecedented carboxylate(O)$\ldots \pi$ interactions played a crucial role in the organization of the 3D supramolecular assembly. The carboxylate(O)$\ldots \pi$ interactions are controlled by the C-H$\ldots \pi$ interactions which were accomplished by the proper modulation of the organic linkers. The formation of these supramolecular frameworks revealed that control of weak interactions can be achieved by the interplay of both energetically strong (covalent) and weak forces (non-covalent).</p>

				<title>Theoretical studies on energetic materials bearing pentaflurosulphyl (SF<sub>5</sub>) groups</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1163-1172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heats of formation (HOF) for a series of energetic materials containing SF<sub>5</sub> group were studied by density functional theory. Results show that HOFs increase with the augmention of field effects of substituted groups. Addition of furazan or furoxan ring increases HOF of the energetic materials. All the SF<sub>5</sub>-containing compounds have densities which are ‚àº0.19 g/cm<sup>3</sup> higher than those containing -NH<sub>2</sub> group. S-F bond is the trigger bond for the thermolysis process in the title compounds and bond dissociation energies of the weakest bonds range from 351.1 to 388.3 kJ/mol. Detonation velocities (D) and pressures (P) are evaluated by Kamlet-Jacobs equations with the calculated densities and HOFs. Results show that increasing the amount of furazan rings results in a larger D and P. Considering the detonation performance and thermal stability, eight compounds may be considered as potential candidates for high-energy density materials.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reaction pathways of methylamine with ozone on the singlet potential energy profile have been investigated at the RB3LYP/6-311++G (3df-3pd) computational level. Calculated results reveal that six kinds of products P<sub>1</sub> (CH<sub>3</sub>NO + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), P<sub>2</sub> (CH<sub>3</sub>NH + OH + O<sub>2</sub>), P<sub>3</sub> (NH<sub>2</sub>CH + HO<sub>2</sub>+ OH), P<sub>4</sub> (CH<sub>2</sub>NH + H<sub>2</sub>O +O<sub>2</sub>), P<sub>5</sub> (NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + O<sub>2</sub>), P<sub>6</sub> (NH<sub>3</sub>+ CH<sub>2</sub>O +O<sub>2</sub>) are obtained through variety of transformation of one reactant complex C1. Cleavage and formation of the chemical bonds in the reaction pathways have been discussed using the structural parameters. Based on the calculations, the title reaction leads to NH<sub>3</sub>+ CH<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> as thermodynamic adducts in an exothermic process by ‚àí76.28 kcal/mol in heat realizing and spontaneous reaction by ‚àí86.71 kcal/mol in standard Gibbs free energy. From a kinetic viewpoint, the production of CH<sub>3</sub>NH + OH + O<sub>2</sub> adducts with one transition state is the most favoured path.</p>

				<title>Exploration of minima on the C<sub>7</sub>H$^+_7$ surface: Structural, stabilityand charge-related considerations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1181-1195</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Four <i>ab initio</i> quantum chemical approaches were used to study the relative stability, structure and charge distribution of 33 putative C<sub>7</sub>H$^+_7$ isomeric structures. All of them proved to be true minima on the C<sub>7</sub>H$^+_7$ potential energy surface. Stability orders for all 33 isomers as derived from the four computational strategies used here showed a fair degree of correlation with one another, especially between the density functional theory (DFT) and MP2 data sets. These computational results reproduced the stability order tropyl &#62; benzyl &#62; mtolyl &#62; o-tolyl &#62; p-tolyl derived from previous results of high-level theory and experiment. Structural features such as aromaticity, cyclic or acyclic structure, allylic and other conjugation effects, carbon atom hybridization state and small ring strain were invoked as factors which augment or diminish cation stability. The NICS index for aromaticity could distinguish well between aromatic, non-aromatic and anti-aromatic ring moieties in the cations. Application of these factors proved to be quite consistent in rationalizing in a broad manner the calculated stability orders for the entire set. Joint consideration of the optimized geometry and charge distribution led to the choice of a single canonical form or hybrid best representing each C<sub>7</sub>H$^+_7$ isomer.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>1197-1207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We systematically studied the geometrical structures, relative stabilities, electronic properties and chemical hardness of Au$_n$Cd (ùëõ=1-12) clusters based on the framework of the density functional theory using relativistic all-electron methods. Low-lying energy structures include two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries. Especially, all the lowest-energy structures of Au$_n$Cd (ùëõ=1‚àí12) clusters are inclined to be planar geometries with slight distortion, in which the dopant Cd atom has higher coordination at ùëõ=2-6, but lower coordination at ùëõ=7-12. The fragmentation energies, second-order difference of energies, the highest occupied-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps and chemical hardness of Au$_n$Cd and Au$_{n+1}$ exhibit a pronounced even-odd alternations phenomenon in the reverse order This result indicates that the geometrical, electronic and chemical stabilities of Au$_n$Cd with even number of valence electrons are higher than those of the neighbouring Au$_n$Cd with odd number of valence electrons and corresponding Au$_{n+1}$ with odd number of valence electrons. Additionally, $4d$ valence electrons orbital of impurity Cd atom in AunCd hardly joins in the orbital interactions compared with $5d$ valence electrons of corresponding Au atom in Au$_{n+1}$. Au-Cd bonds of AunCd clusters are weaker and have more obviously ionic-like characteristics than the corresponding Au-Au bonds of Au$_{n+1}$.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The proton affinities, gas phase basicities and adiabatic ionization energies and electron affinities of some important hydroxylamines and alkanolamines were calculated using B3LYP, CBS-Q and G4MP2 methods. Also, the B3LYP method was used to calculate vertical ionization energies and electron affinities of the molecules. The calculated ionization energies are in the range of 8-10.5 eV and they decrease as the number of carbon atoms increases. Computational results and ion mobility spectrometry study confirm that some alkanolamines lose a water molecule due to protonation at oxygen site and form cationic cyclic compounds. Effect of different substitutions on the cyclization of ethanolamine was studied theoretically.</p>

				<title>Ab initio study of solvent-dependent one-, two- and three-photon absorption properties of PRODAN-based chemo-sensors</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, we study the solvent-dependent one-, two- and three-photon absorption (1PA, 2PA and 3PA) properties of 2-propionyl-6-dimethylamino naphthalene (PRODAN) and three newly synthesized20 cyclopenta[b]naphthalene derivatives, in gas phase and three different solvents, namely cyclohexane, dichloromethane and ethanol. A comparison between the calculated and the available experimental data shows that the results obtained with B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level of theory matches well with the experimental absorption data for all of these compounds. The 2P and 3P transition probabilities, for all of these systems, are found to be maximum in solvents of intermediate polarity (here, dichloromethane), which is in accordance with the experimental observation for various other systems. All the 1P, 2P and 3P transition probabilities are found to be the maximum for PRODAN as compared to other three molecules in both the gas as well as the different solvent phases (except for 3PA in gas and cyclohexane solvents). We have explained these results by meticulously inspecting the components of different transition moment vectors and the tensor elements involved.</p>

				<title>Salts and Co-crystals of Theobromine and their phase transformations in water</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Chemical Crystallography</feature>
				<page>1249-1264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Theobromine, a xanthine derivative analogous to caffeine and theophylline, is an effective central nervous system stimulant. It has lower aqueous solubility than caffeine and theophylline. Salts of theobromine with hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid and ùëù-toluenesulfonic acid were prepared using liquid-assisted grinding (LAG). Proton transfer from the strong acid to the weak base imidazole N resulted in N<sup>+</sup>-H‚Ä¶O<sup>‚àí</sup> hydrogen-bonded supramolecular assemblies of theobromine salts. The mesylate salt is polymorphic with amide N-H‚Ä¶O dimer and catemer synthons for the theobromine cations. A variable stoichiometry for phosphate salts (1:3 and 1:2.5) were observed with the latter being more stable. All new salts were characterized by FT-IR, PXRD, DSC and finally single crystal X-ray diffraction. In terms of stability, these salts transformed to theobromine within 1 h of dissolution in water. Remarkably, the besylate and tosylate salts are 88 and 58 times more soluble than theobromine, but they dissociated within 1 h. In contrast, theobromine co-crystals with gallic acid, anthranilic acid and 5-chlorosalicylic acid were found to be stable for more than 24 h in the aqueous slurry conditions, except malonic co-crystal which transformed to theobrominewithin 1 h.Water mediated phase transformation of theobromine salts and co-crystalmay be due to the incongruency (high solubility difference) between the components. These results suggest that even though traditional salts are highly soluble compared to co-crystals, co-crystals can be superior in terms of stability.</p>

					<p>Thermal stability and thermal expansion of bromo trimer synthon mediated hexagonal inclusion compounds of 2,4,6-tris(4-bromophenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine (BrPOT) with dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and hexamethyl benzene (HMB) and also the guest-free form of BrPOT are reported. Each of these three guests produced two concomitant inclusion compounds with BrPOT. The thermal stability of the solvate lattice increases with decreasing cavity size. The channel network of the DCM inclusion compound is stable only for a few seconds at room temperature outside the mother liquor, whereas the cage network of the DCM solvate is stable for months under similar conditions. Thermal expansions of the lattices depend upon the network, guest content as well as the type of guest molecules. The guest-free form exhibits the least thermal expansion in this series of systems.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Crystal structures of four <i>green fluorescent protein (GFP)</i> chromophore analogues with different packing interactions could be tuned by appropriate substitutions around the imidazolin-5-one ring are reported here. Compound <b>1</b> was crystallized from tetrahydrofuran at room temperature while compounds <b>2-4</b> have been crystallized from a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane in 3:1 ratio. Molecule <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> crystallized in monoclinic lattice while molecule <b>4</b>  preferred to crystallize in a triclinic crystal system. The crystal packing of these molecules was stabilized by C-H$\ldots \pi$ stacking and C-H$\ldots $O type of supramolecular interactions. The results reveal that packing diversity can be easily accomplished in these molecules by tuning the substituents around the imidazolin-5-one ring. Photophysical studies also reveal that all have good quantum yield and fluoresce typically in red region due to presence of electron donating groups around the imidazolin-5-one ring.</p>

				<feature>Special issue on Chemical Crystallography</feature>
				<page>1291-1302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Six new salts of an API intermediate 2-aminothiazole with different carboxylic acid coformers were synthesized and characterized by IR (Infrared spectroscopy), <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, DSC (Differential scanning calorimetry), XRPD (X-ray powder diffraction) and single crystal XRD. The crystal structure of the salts with benzoic acid, 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6- dihydroxybenzoic acids and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid were determined. The thiazole moiety exhibited solvent (polarity) assisted tautomerism in all reported salts and proton transfer was noticed to the ring N of thiazole due to which two point supramolecular synthon N<sup>+</sup>‚àíH(thiazole)‚Ä¶O<sup>‚àí</sup>(acid), N‚àíH(amine)‚Ä¶O<sup>‚àí</sup>(acid) was observed. The crystal structures were studied with respect to the positional effect of the competing functional groups like hydroxyl (‚àíOH) and nitro (‚àíNO<sub>2</sub>) as well as their donor and acceptor abilities for hydrogen bonding. The presence of the non-conventional hydrogen bond (C‚àíH‚Ä¶O) has been found to play a critical role in the formation of secondary supramolecular architectures.</p>

Attempted aromatization of <b>20</b>  and <b>21</b>  using DDQ (2, 3-dichloro-5, 6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone) as an oxidizing agent afforded the co-crystals. The hexaselenophenyl derivative, <b>22</b>  and the hexaselenocyanate derivative <b>23</b>  were synthesized by the reaction of <i>in situ</i> generated sodium arylselenolate/potassium selenocyanate with hexabromododecahydrotriphenylene, respectively.

				<abstract>
					<p>A modular design of a molecular tweezer is presented that integrates a multipolar D-ùúã-A [D: Donor, A: Acceptor] scaffold, 1-aminopyrene-based fluorophore units and L-alanine-based linkers. The synthesis of the molecule is based on two-fold aromatic nucleophilic reactions (ArS<sub>N</sub>) and coupling reactions of the acid and amino functionalities. This molecule crystallizes in a non-centrosymmteric (P21) space group.We present its rich self-assembly characteristics that involves an array of ùúã-stacking interactions. In addition, the molecular tweezer within its cleft forms H-bonding with two dimethylformamide molecules. Such multipolar D-ùúã-A systems containing chiral and fluorophore units are potential candidatesfor a number of electronic and photonic applications.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we have prepared and structurally characterized a derivative of 1,2,4 triazoles, namely 3-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)-1-((4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiol (<b>T-1</b>) via single crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure was observed to be stabilized by the presence of various intermolecular interactions in the crystalline solid such as O-H‚Ä¶S, C-H‚Ä¶F, C-H‚Ä¶S, C-H‚Ä¶N, C-H‚Ä¶O, C-H$\ldots \pi$, $lp\ldots \pi$ and $\pi \ldots \pi$ intermolecular interactions. The interaction energy of these interactions was evaluated through PIXEL method with decomposition of the total energy into the coulombic, polarization, dispersion and repulsion contribution. The study of the nature of H-bonds with sulfur reveals that stabilization due to contribution from polarization plays a significant role. It is noteworthy that the presence of the solvent molecules in the crystal structure were observed to provide stabilization to an otherwise destabilized molecular pair (comprising of two molecules of 1,2,4 triazoles in the asymmetric unit).</p>

Compound <b>1</b> crystallizes in the space group $P^¬Ø_ƒ±$ with Z=8, with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Compound <b>2</b> also crystallizes in the space group $P^¬Ø_ƒ±$ with Z=4 wherein asymmetric unit accommodates two molecules. Compound <b>3</b> belongs to $P2_1$/c with Z=4, compound <b>4</b>  crystallizes in ùëÉbc2<sub>1</sub> with Z= 4 and compound <b>5</b>  belongs to $P^¬Ø_ƒ±$ with Z=2. In all the above compounds, the aryl ring positioned at C5 of thiazolopyrimidine ring is almost perpendicular. In the case of compounds with substituted phenyl ring, aryl group-up conformation predominates. However, for compounds with unsubstituted phenyl ring, aryl group-down conformation is adopted. By varying the substituents at positions C2, C3, C6 and on the aryl at C5 in the main molecular scaffold of (<b>1-5</b>), we have observed significant differences in the intermolecular interaction patterns. The packing features of the compounds are controlled by C-H‚Ä¶O, C-H‚Ä¶N, N-H‚Ä¶N O-H‚Ä¶N, C-H$\ldots \pi$ and $\pi\ldots \pi$ weak interactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Salt formation has been shown as a simple strategy to induce aggregated induced emission or aggregated enhanced emission in primary ammonium salts derived from 9-anthracene carboxylic acid, 1-pyrene carboxylic acid, 3-coumarin carboxylic acid and histamine. All the salts displayed enhanced fluorescence in their solid state compared to that in their solution state. Single crystal structure of the salt of 9-anthracene carboxylic acid i.e., His-anthracene revealed that restricted intramolecular rotation of the fluorphoric moiety (anthracene) was responsible for such radiative pathway leading to enhanced emission.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrothermal treatment of indium(III) nitrate with a flexible pseudo $C_3$-symmetric tricarboxylic acid at 115&#176;C for 5 days in DMF yields a new layered anionic indium carboxylate framework, [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> NH<sub>2</sub>)][In(L)(HCOO)(DMF)]$_n$ (<b>1</b>) (L = 2,4,6-tris[(4&#8242;-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), existing as two-dimensional sheets. The framework solid has been characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, TGA, PXRD and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. DMF undergoes cleavage to dimethyl ammonium and formate ions, which are incorporated in the framework. A slipped stacking of the two dimensional sheets along ùëé-axis in <b>1</b> results in a drastic decrease in the anticipated large porosity of the framework.</p>

				<title>Tuning porosity via control of interpenetration in a zinc isonicotinate metal organic framework</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Chemical Crystallography</feature>
				<page>1393-1398</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous solids formed by linking metal centres or metal clusters by suitable organic ligands capable of generating porosity in the microporous and mesoporous regimes. They have been investigated extensively for their gas storage applications in the last two decades. Interpenetration is nature‚Äôs way of avoiding excessive free-space within the large porous networks by growing identical but independent networks within a parent network to decrease the solvent accessible voids and increase stability. A major challenge in MOF synthesis involves minimizing or completely eliminating the extent. In this paper, we report a zinc isonicotinate (or pyridyl-4-carboxylate, 4-PyC) MOF, <b>1</b>, prepared by tuning the synthesis conditions to minimize interpenetration. The three-fold interpenetration presented in this material is unusual and has been compared to the other zinc isonicotinates to identify the differences contributing to the improved porosity. In addition, the thermal decomposition of <b>1</b> in an oxygen-deficient medium has been shown to yield significantly porous carbon embedded with ZnO nanoparticles.</p>

				<title>Structural diversity in serine derived homochiral metal organic frameworks</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two new Zn(II) and Cd(II) based homochiral metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [SerCdOAc and Zn(Ser)<sub>2</sub>] have been synthesized using pyridyl functionalized amino acid, viz., serine, as an organic linker. The SerCdOAc structure is three dimensional, while that of the Zn(Ser)<sub>2</sub> is two dimensional. The polar voids of the corresponding MOFs are filled with solvent molecules (water in the case of SerCdOAc and methanol in the case of Zn(Ser)<sub>2</sub>). In both cases, metal centres, i.e., Zn(II) and Cd(II), are hexacoordinated. However, with a change in the solvent for synthesis, ligand coordinationmode and incorporation of additional coordinated anion resulted in a great change in the final MOF architecture. Herein, for the first time, we could achieve structural variety and synthesize MOFs composed of only metal ion and pyridyl functionalized amino acid linker.</p>

					<p>Four 2D helical coordination polymers (CPs) (<b>1-4</b>) were synthesized using achiral 2,6-bis (imidazol-1-yl)pyridine (pyim<sub>2</sub>) ligand with metal nitrates (metal = zinc and cadmium), which showed that variation in the solvent condition leads to difference in geometry around the central metal ion and results in chiral/achiral behaviour of these CPs.

On the other hand, in ternary solvent mixture (DMF/MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O) it resulted into an achiral {[<i>trans</i>-Zn(pyim<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]¬∑(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}$_n$ (<b>3</b>) and homochiral {[<i>cis</i>-Cd(pyim<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]¬∑(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}$_n$ (<b>4</b>) coordination polymer, respectively.

				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of the deprotonated form of the Schiff base ligand; (E)-2-methoxy-6-((phenylimino) methyl)phenol (L) with nickel chloride hydrate results in the formation of the 1-dimentional coordination polymer; Na[Ni(L)<sub>2</sub>(OMe)(MeOH)]$_n$ (<b>1</b>). The structure was determined via single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. A careful analysis of the complex shows that the polymer exists as a helical structure, where the helicity is brought about by the presence of an alkali metal ion which is observed for the first time. Moreover the helical structure in <b>1</b> is maintained predominantly through covalent bond rather than supramolecular interactions. Direct current magnetic susceptibility measurement suggests that complex <b>1</b> obeys the Curie law. The fitting of magnetic data using the PHI software package yields parameters of ùëÜ = 1, ùëî = 2.26 and ùê∑ = +4.51 (or ùê∑  = ‚àí7.24cm<sup>-1</sup>) for <b>1</b>.</p>

The potassium complex <b>2</b> was readily prepared by the reaction of potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide with phosphinoselenoic amide ligand (<b>1</b>) at ambient temperature. The calcium complex <b>4</b> was prepared by two synthetic routes: in the first method, commonly known as salt metathesis reaction, the potassium complex <b>2</b> was made to react with alkaline earth metal diiodide at room temperature to afford the corresponding calcium complex. The metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides were made to react with protic ligand <b>1</b> in the second method to eliminate the volatile bis(trimethyl)silyl amine. The magnesium complex <b>3</b> and barium complex <b>5</b> were prepared only through the first method. Solid-state structures of all the new complexes were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The smaller ionic radii of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.72&#197;) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.99&#197;) ions form the monomeric complex, whereas the larger ions K<sup>+</sup> (1.38&#197;) and Ba<sup>2+</sup> (1.35&#197;) were found to form onedimensional polymeric complexes with monoanionic ligand <b>1</b>.

Of these, <b>I</b> have pentanuclear nickel, whereas <b>II</b> and <b>III</b> have nonanuclear nickel species. The structures are formed by the connectivity between the nickel and benzotriazole giving rise to the 5- and 9-membered nickel clusters. The structures are stabilised by extensive $\pi \ldots \pi$ and C-H$\ldots \pi$ interactions. Compound <b>II</b> and <b>III</b> are solvotamorphs as they have the same 9-membered nickel clusters and have different solvent molecules. To the best of our knowledge, the compounds <b>I-III</b> represent the first examples of the same transition element existing in two distinct coordination environment in this class of compounds. The studies reveal that compound <b>I</b> is reactive and could be an intermediate in the preparation of <b>II</b> and <b>III</b>. Thermal studies indicate that the compounds are stable upto 350&#176;C and at higher temperatures (‚àº800&#176;C) the compounds decompose into NiO.Magnetic studies reveal that <b>II</b> is anti-ferromagnetic.</p>

					<p>A rare variety of self-assembledmolecular triangle [Pd<sub>3</sub>(bpy)<sub>3</sub>(imidazolate)<sub>3</sub>](NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, <b>1</b> is prepared by the combination of Pd(bpy)(NO3)2 with imidazole, at 1:1 ratio, in acetonitrile-water. Deprotonation of imidazole happened during the course of the complexation reaction where upon the metallomacrocycle is formed. The bowl-shaped trinuclear architecture of <b>1</b> is crafted with three peripheral bpy units capable of ùúã - ùúã stacking interactions. While the solution state structure of <b>1</b> can be best described as a trinuclear complex, in the solidstate well-fashioned intermolecular $\pi - \pi$ and CH-ùúã interactions are observed. Thus, in the solid-state further self-assembly of already self-assembled molecular triangle is witnessed. The triangular panels are arranged in a linear manner utilizing intermolecular ùúã - ùúã interactions where upon two out of three bpy units of each molecule participated in the chain formation.</p>

					<p>The chemical reaction of Pt<sup>II</sup>(L<sup>1</sup>)Cl<sub>2</sub> [L<sup>1</sup> = 2-(phenylazo)pyridine] with a bidentate N,S-donor atom ligand, 2-phenylthioaniline, (HL2) in alkaline acetonitrile yielded a mixed ligand donor acceptor complex, [Pt<sup>II</sup>(L<sup>1</sup>)(L<sup>2</sup>)‚àí]Cl, [1]Cl. The complex has been characterized by using a host of physical methods: X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, cyclic voltammetry, absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance. The complex showed intense interligand charge transfer (ILCT) transition in the long wavelength region of UV-vis spectrum at 785 nm. The single-crystal X-ray structure of complex, [<b>1</b>]Cl¬∑2.6H<sub>2</sub>O is reported. The cationic complex upon crystallization from aqueous methanol solvent produces an assembly of three dimensional (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>8</sub> guest moiety within the host lattice of reference Pt-complex. The water assembly showed a unique type of aggregation of two trigonal pyramids hydrogen bonded with three chloride anions. The complex displayed two reversible responses at ‚àí0.34 and ‚àí1.05 V along with one irreversible anodic response at 0.91 V <i>versus</i> Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The redox processes are characterized by examination of EPR spectra of the electrogenerated complexes.</p>

				<title>Construction of diverse supramolecular assemblies of dimetal subunits differing in coordinated water molecules via strong hydrogen bonding interactions: Synthesis, crystal structures and spectroscopic properties</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Three new supramolecular assemblies (constructed through strong hydrogen bonding) of [Co<sub>2</sub>(bpta)<sub>2</sub>(adc)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>1</b>), [Cu<sub>2</sub>(bpta)<sub>2</sub>(fum)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>](ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (<b>2</b>) and [Cu<sub>2</sub>(bpta)<sub>2</sub>(tdc)(H<sub>2</sub>O) (ClO<sub>4</sub>)](ClO<sub>4</sub>).3H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>3</b>), which are synthesised by one pot self-assembly of the metal salt, bpta ligand and the corresponding dicarboxylate under the same reaction conditions, are reported (where adc = acetylene dicarboxylate, fum = fumarate, tdc = 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate and bpta = N,N'-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-tertbutylamine). These compounds have varying degrees of coordinatedwater molecules per dimetal subunits (four for <b>1</b>, two for <b>2</b> and one for <b>3</b>, respectively). Furthermore, the orientation of the coordinated water molecules in <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, with respect to the mono (carboxylato)-bridged dimetal subunit, is different (cis and trans, respectively). On the other hand, there is a coordinated perchlorate ion in <b>3</b> making the two metal centers inequivalent. Unlike <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>, there are no lattice water molecules in <b>2</b>. This difference in the dimetal subunit in <b>1-3</b> and the presence or absence of the lattice water molecules are the keys to forming the diverse supramolecular assemblies. In <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>, the involvement of lattice water molecules in the construction of such assemblies is distinctly different. In case of <b>2</b>, the formation of supramolecular assembly depends on the coordinated water molecule (trans to each other) and thus a ladder shaped supramolecular assembly is the result. The strength of hydrogen bonding observed in the networks of <b>1-3</b> is indicated in the O‚Ä¶O distances (2.596 √Ö to 3.160 √Ö) and the OH‚Ä¶O angles 124&#176; to 176&#176;. All are characterised by elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies.</p>

				<title>How strongly are the magnetic anisotropy and coordination numbers correlated in lanthanide based molecular magnets?</title>
				<feature>Special issue on Chemical Crystallography</feature>
				<page>1569-1579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ab <i>initio</i> CASSCF+RASSI-SO investigations on a series of lanthanide complexes [Ln<sup>III</sup> = Dy(<b>1</b>), Tb(<b>2</b>), Ce(<b>3</b>), Nd(<b>4</b>), Pr(<b>5</b>) and Sm(<b>6</b>)] have been undertaken and in selected cases (for <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>) coordination number (C.N.) around the Ln<sup>III</sup> ion has been gradually varied to ascertain the effect of C.N. on the magnetic anisotropy. Our calculations reveal that complex <b>3</b> possesses the highest barrier height for reorientation of magnetisation (U<sub>eff</sub>) and predict that <b>3</b> is likely to exhibit Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour. Complex <b>5</b>  on the other hand is predicted to preclude any SMM behaviour as there is no intrinsic barrier for reorientation of magnetization. Ground state anisotropy of all the complexes show mixed behaviour ranging from pure Ising type to fully rhombic behaviour. Coordination number around the lanthanide ion is found to alter the magnetic behaviour of all the lanthanide complexes studied and this is contrary to the general belief that the lanthanide ions are inert and exert small ligand field interaction.High symmetric low-coordinate Ln<sup>III</sup> complexes are found to yield large U<sub>eff</sub> values and thus should be the natural targets for achieving very large blocking temperatures.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of 9-hydroxophenalenone based alkaline earth and zinc complexes.The reaction of 9-hydroxophenalenone (HO,O-PLY (<b>1</b>)) with one equivalent of KN(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and MI<sub>2</sub> in THF yields heteroleptic complexes [(O,O-PLY)M(THF)$_n$]I [M= Mg (<b>2</b>), Ca (<b>3</b>), Sr (<b>4</b>), Ba (<b>5</b>); n = 1-4], while use of two equivalents of KN(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in THF (with respect to PLY) produces homoleptic complex (O,O-PLY)<sub>2</sub>Mg(THF)<sub>2</sub> (<b>6</b>). Moreover, reaction between two equivalents of <b>1</b> with one equivalent of ZnMe<sub>2</sub> in THF produces complex (O,O-PLY)<sub>2</sub>Zn(THF)<sub>2</sub> (<b>7</b>). All these complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses. The solid state structures of complexes <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>  and <b>7</b>  were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.</p>

					<p>Sm<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>19</sub> was obtained as large rod shaped single crystals from reactive aluminium flux.

Sm<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>19</sub> is a member of the Sm$_{2n+m}$Ni$_{4n+m}$Al$_{15n+4m}$ series with n = 1 and m = 1. The crystal structure of Sm<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>19</sub> consists of SmNiAl<sub>4</sub> and Sm<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>15</sub> slabs intergrown along the ùëè-axis. Magnetic susceptibility data on Sm<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>19</sub> confirms the paramagnetic nature with a complicated magnetic ordering below 18 K.

				<title>Synthesis and properties of a dual responsive hydrogel by inverse microemulsion polymerization</title>
				<feature>Rapid Communications</feature>
				<page>1623-1627</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel dual responsive hydrogelwas synthesized by inversemicroemulsion polymerization, using itaconic acid as pH-responsive monomer and N- isopropylacrylamide as thermo-responsivemonomer. pH- and temperature-sensitivity and dynamic viscoelasticity behaviour of the dual responsive hydrogels were investigated. Dual responsive hydrogels showed remarkable pH- and temperature-sensitivity and enhanced viscoelastic behaviour under high stress. Temperature-induced shrinkage range of the dual responsive hydrogels was higher and broader than that of the conventional poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel. FTIR revealed the structure of dual responsive hydrogels. The as-synthesized regular and sphere-like hydrogel particles had the average particle size of 49 nm in the range of 30-78 nm.</p>

				<title>Mechanistic chemistry of oxidation of balsalazide with acidic chloramine-T and bromamine-T: A comparative spectrophotometric kinetic study</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1655-1664</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Balsalazide (BSZ) belongs to a class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of BSZ with sodium N-halo-p-toluenesulfonamides viz., chloramine-T(CAT) and bromamine-T(BAT) in HClO<sub>4</sub> medium have been spectrophotometrically investigated ($\lambda_{\max}$ =357nm) at 303 K. Under comparable experimental conditions, reactions with both the oxidants follow a first-order dependence of rate on [BSZ] and fractional-order dependence on each [oxidant] and [HClO4]. Activation parameters and reaction constants have been computed. 2-hydroxy-5-nitroso-benzoic acid and 3-(4-nitroso-benzoylamino)-propionic acid are identified as the oxidation products of BSZ with both CAT and BAT.

					<p>By employing two $mer$-tricyanidoiron(III) precursors [Ph<sub>4</sub>P][Fe<sup>III</sup>(pcq)(CN)<sub>3</sub>] and [Ph<sub>4</sub>P][Fe<sup>III</sup> (pzq)(CN)<sub>3</sub>] as building blocks and a salen-tpye Schiff-basemanganese (III) compound as assembling segment, two tetranuclear cyanide- and phenoxo- bridged heterobimetallic Fe(III)-Mn(III) complexes {[Mn(saltmen)] [Fe(pcq)(CN)<sub>3</sub>]}<sub>2</sub>¬∑2CH<sub>3</sub>OH (<b>1</b>) and {[Mn(saltmen)] [Fe(pzq)(CN)<sub>3</sub>]}<sub>2</sub>¬∑2CH<sub>3</sub>OH (<b>2</b>) (pcq = 8-(pyridine-2-carboxamido, pzq = 8-(pyrazine-2-carboxamido, saltmen<sup>2‚àí</sup> = N,N&#8242;-(1,1,2,2-tetramethylethylene)bis(salicylideneaminato) dianion) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and X-ray structure determination. Single x-ray analysis reveals their isostructural cyanide-bridged Fe(III)-Mn(III) binuclear structure. The binuclear entity is self-complementary through phenoxo oxygen from the neighbouring complex, giving cyanide- and phenoxo- bridged tetranuclear structure. Furthermore, under the help of the intermolecular ùúã-ùúã interaction, these two complexes can be constructed into 1D infinite chain supramolecular structure. Investigation over magnetic susceptibilities reveals the overall ferromagnetic coupling between the adjacent Fe(III) and Mn(III) ions bridged by cyanide group with ùêΩ = 5.34 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 5.55 cm<sup>-1</sup> for complexes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Uranyl(VI) complexes with unsymmetrical N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Schiff base ligands were synthesized and characterized. Their characterization was performed using UV-Vis, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, cyclic voltammetry, single-crystal X-ray crystallography, IR, TG and C.H.N. techniques. X-ray crystallography of the complexes show that beside coordination of the tetradentate Schiff base, one DMF molecule is also coordinated. In order to investigate the effect of the substitutional groups of the Schiff base on the oxidation and reduction potentials, we used the cyclic voltammetry method. Electrochemistry of these complexes showed that the presence of electron releasing groups accelerates oxidation of the complexes. The kinetics of thermal decomposition was studied using thermal gravimetric method (TG) and Coats-Redfern equation. According to Coats-Redfern plots, the kinetics of thermal decomposition of the studied complexes is first-order in all stages. Also the kinetics and mechanism of the exchange reaction of the coordinated solvent with tributylphosphine was carried out in solution, using spectrophotometric method. As a result, the second order rate constants at four temperatures and the activation parameters were calculated showing an associative mechanism for all corresponding complexes. It was concluded that the steric and the electronic properties of the complexes influence the reaction rate significantly.</p>

				<title>Polymer supported nickel complex: Synthesis, structure and catalytic application</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1695-1705</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present investigation, a new synthetic route for a novel recyclable free [3-MOBdMBn-Ni] and polystyrene-anchored [P-3-MOBdMBn-Ni] nickel complexes is presented. The free and polymer-anchored metal complexes were synthesized by the reaction of nickel (II) with one molar equivalent of unsupported N N&#8242;-bis (2-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) 4-Methylbenzene-1,2-diamine (3-MOBdMBn) or polymersupported (P-3-MOBdMBn) Schiff-base ligand in methanol under nitrogen atmosphere. The advantages of these polymer-supported catalysts are the low cost of catalyst and recyclability up to six times, due to easy availability of materials and simple synthetic route. The higher efficiency of complexation of nickel on the polymer-anchored 3-MOBdMBn Schiff base than the unsupported analogue is another advantage of this catalyst system. The structural study reveals that nickel(II) complex of 3-MOBdMBn is square planar in geometry. The catalytic activity of nickel complex towards the oxidation of phenol was investigated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Experimental results indicate that the reactivity of P-3-MOBdMBn-Ni was dramatically affected by the polymer support compared to free 3-MOBdMBn-Ni. The rates of oxidation (R$_p$) for unsupported and supported catalysts are 1.37 &#215; 10<sup>-6</sup> mole dm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and 2.33 &#215; 10<sup>-6</sup> mole dm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Structures and electronic properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) with pyridine (3NVZGNR) functionalized by Scandium (Sc) at the edge were studied through quantum chemical calculations in the formalism of density-functional theory (DFT). Pyridine-like nitrogen defects is very crucial for enhancing the Sc atom binding to the defects and is thermodynamically favoured. During Sc decoration of ZGNR there is a shift from 0.35 eV small gap semiconductor regime to that of a metal which can be used for band gap tuning by controlled saturation of Sc. ZGNR decorated with Sc can attract H<sub>2</sub>. Upon saturation of multiple H<sub>2</sub> in quasi-molecular fashion, the metallic character is converted to semiconductors of small gap of 0.10 eV, which are predicted to be interesting materials not only for hydrogen storage but also for their band gap engineered properties.</p>

For the Cr<sup>+</sup>¬∑(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and Cr<sup>+</sup>¬∑(N<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> complexes, distorted trigonal pyramidal and tetrahedral geometries were optimized with sequential bond dissociation energies of 6.5 and 5.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. ùúã- back-donation in side-on approach of the Cr<sup>+</sup>¬∑N<sub>2</sub> leads to the formation of a tilted structure with the Cr<sup>+</sup> ion in central position. The di-ligated complex exhibits the strongest bond dissociation energy among these four Cr<sup>+</sup>¬∑(N<sub>2</sub>)$_n$ (n = 1‚Äî4) complexes since it has the largest Cr<sup>+</sup>‚ÄîN bond order.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Based on the full optimized molecular geometric structures at B3LYP/6-311++G$^{\ast\ast}level, the densities (ùúå), heats of formation (HOFs), detonation velocities (D) and pressures (P) for a series of ditetrazoles derivatives, were investigated to look for high energy density materials (HEDMs). The results show that the influence of different substituted groups on HOFs has the order of -N<sub>3</sub>&#62;-CN&#62;-NH<sub>2</sub>&#62;-NO<sub>2</sub>&#62;-NF<sub>2</sub>&#62;-ONO<sub>2</sub>&#62;-H&#62;-CH<sub>3</sub>&#62;-CF<sub>3</sub>. The introduction of -CF<sub>3</sub> groups is more favourable for increasing the density and the introduction of -CH<sub>3</sub> groups is not favourable for increasing the density. In addition, all the series combined with -NF<sub>2</sub> group except B-NF<sub>2</sub> all have higher densities, larger D and P. F-NF<sub>2</sub> may be regarded as the potential candidates of HEDMs because of the largest detonation velocity and pressure among these derivatives.The energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO of the studied compounds are also investigated.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study on O$\cdots$Br and O$\cdots$Cl halogen bonds in some small model molecular systems</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1763-1779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Halogen bonding interactions of type X$\cdots$O=C are important in various fields including biological systems. In this work, theoretical calculations were carried out using B3LYP/6-31++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup>, MP2/6-31++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ methods on a series of O$\cdots$X halogen bonds between CH<sub>2</sub>O andCH<sub>3</sub>CHO as halogen bond acceptor with X-Y (X = Cl, Br; Y = CF<sub>3</sub>, CF<sub>2</sub> H, CFH<sub>2</sub>, CN, CCH, CCCN) as halogen bond donors. The strength of interaction energy for O$\cdots$Br halogen-bonded complexes varies from ‚àí2.16 to ‚àí5.26 kcal/mol while for O$\cdots$Cl complexes, it is between ‚àí1.65 to ‚àí3.67 kcal/mol, which indicate the O$\cdots$Br bond to be stronger in comparison to O$\cdots$Cl bond. SAPT analysis suggests that the strength of halogen bonding arises from the electrostatic and induction forces while dispersion is playing a comparatively smaller role. The halogen-bonded interaction energies were found to correlate well with positive electrostatic potential V$_{\text{S,max}}$, halogen bonded distances, and the change in s-character of C-X bond. The halogen-bonded interaction energies were also evaluated for O$\cdots$I bonded complexes and thus these complexes were found to be stronger than O$\cdots$Br and O$\cdots$Cl bonded complexes.</p>

				<title>Structure, bonding and energetics of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized low oxidation state group 2 (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) metal complexes: A theoretical study</title>

				<page>1781-1788</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of N-heterocyclic carbene stabilized low oxidation state group 2 metal halide and hydrides with metal-metal bonds ([L(X) M-M(X) L]; L = NHC ((CHNH)<sub>2</sub>C:), M = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba, and X = Cl or H) has been studied by computational methods. The main objective of this study is to predict whether it is possible to stabilize neutral ligated low oxidation state alkaline-earth metal complexes with metal-metal bonds. The homolytic metal-metal Bond Dissociation Energy (BDE) calculation, Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Energy Decomposition Analyses (EDA) on density functional theory (DFT) optimized [L(X)M-M(X)L] complexes revealed that they are as stable as their ùõΩ-diketiminate, guanidinate and ùõº-diimine counterparts. The optimized structures of the complexes are in trans-linear geometries. The bond order analyses such as Wiberg Bond Indices (WBI) and Fuzzi Bond Order (FBO) confirm the existence of single bond between two metal atoms, and it is covalent in nature.</p>

				<title>A computational study on kinetics, mechanism and thermochemistry of gas-phase reactions of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone with OH radicals</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1789-1801</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Theoretical investigation has been carried out on the kinetics and reaction mechanism of the gas-phase reaction of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (3H2B) with OH radical using dual-level procedure employing the optimization at DFT(BHandHLYP)/6-311++G(d,p) followed by a single-point energy calculation at the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The pre- and post reactive complexes are also validated at entrance and exit channels, respectively. Thus reaction may be proceed via indirect mechanism. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation has also been performed to confirm the smooth transition from a reactant to product through the respective transition states. The rate coefficients were calculated for the first time over a wide range of temperature (250-450 K) and described by the following expression: k<sub>OH</sub> = 7.56 &#215; 10<sup>‚àí11</sup>exp[‚àí(549.3 ¬± 11.2)/T] cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. At 298 K, our calculated rate coefficient 1.20 &#215; 10<sup>‚àí11</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> is in good agreementwith the experimental results. Our calculation indicates that H-abstraction from ùõº-C-H site of 3H2B is the dominant reaction channel. Using group-balanced isodesmic reactions, the standard enthalpies of formation for 3H2B and radicals generated by hydrogen abstraction are reported for the first time. The branching ratios of the different reaction channels are also determined. Also, the atmospheric lifetime of 3H2B is also calculated to be 1.04 days.</p>

				<title>Theoretical study on the detailed repair of O6-methyl guanine to guanine by cysteine</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1803-1813</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The repair process of O6-methylguanine (O6mG) by cysteine (Cys145) has been studied using the quantum mechanical calculations in the presence of solvent water molecules and also using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). The proton transfer from Cys145 to O6mG, directly and mediated by bridged water molecules, has been considered to investigate the role and the sequence of the proton transfer on the repair process. In both models, the energy barrier of the methyl transfer is reduced when the proton is initially transferred from O6mG to Cys145. In addition, the protonation of N3 and N7 sites of O6mG in the acidic environment facilitates the repair process. Results of this study help to understand repair mechanisms of damaged DNA bases better on the basis of proton transfer between that and nucleic acids.</p>

					<p>Ab initio and DFT methods have been employed to study the hydrogen bonding ability of formamide, urea, urea monoxide, thioformamide, thiourea and thiourea monoxide with one water molecule and the homodimers of the selected molecules. The stabilization energies associated with themonohydrated adducts and homodimers‚Äô formation were evaluated at B3LYP/6-311++G^{\ast\ast}$ and MP2/6-311++G<sup>&#8727;&#8727;</sup> levels. The energies were corrected for zero-point vibrational energies and basis set superposition error using counterpoise method. Atoms in molecules study has been carried out in order to characterize the hydrogen bonds through the changes in electron density and laplacian of electron density. A natural energy decomposition and natural bond orbital analysis was performed to understand the nature of hydrogen bonding.</p>

A series of novel aromatic polyamide-imides (PAIs) are prepared from three dicarboxylic acids and synthesized diamines. The phosphorus and silicon containing diamines and all polymers are characterized by FT-IR, NMR spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. The polymers obtained have good thermal stability and glass transition temperature (T$_g$) in the range of 254-315&#176;C. All these novel polyamide-imides (PAIs) contain 10&#37; weight loss at the temperature above 506&#176;C and more than 59&#37; residue at 600&#176;C in nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting polymeric films exhibit high optical transparency and inherent viscosity in the range of 0.68 to 0.79 dL/g. These polymers are found to be soluble in aprotic polar solvents such as NMP, DMSO, DMF and DMAc.Wide angle X-ray diffraction revealed that these polymers are predominantly amorphous in nature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of novel amino acid derivatives has been synthesized by the reaction of 4-[4-methoxy-3-methylphenyl]-4-oxobutenoic acid with primary and secondary amines. The treatment of amino acids with hydrazine afforded pyridazine. Phenylhydrazone was obtained from the reaction of the acid with phenyl hydrazine in ethanol. On the other hand, the acid underwent heterocyclization upon the treatment with 2-aminopyridine, ùëú-phenylenediamine, aryldithiocarbamates and thiourea derivatives to give the corresponding pyridopyrimidine, quinoxalone, 2-thioxo-1,3-thiazole and 4-hydroxy-1,3-thiazole, respectively. The thiazolopyridazine derivatives were obtained from the reaction of 4-hydroxy-1,3-thiazole with hydrazine and phenylhydrazine, respectively. The behaviour of the 4-hydroxy-1,3-thiazole toward acetic anhydride and bromine was also studied. The proposed structures of the products were based on microanalytical and spectroscopic data. Some of the synthesized compounds also exhibited anti-microbial activities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fe(HSO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(FHS) was used as an efficient catalyst for the heterogeneous addition of a series of benzylic and allylic alcohols to various ùõΩ-dicarbonyl compounds, which afforded moderate to excellent yields of ùê∂-alkylated products in 1,2-dichloroethane. In comparison with the previous methods, the present research surprisingly exhibited higher reaction yields without formation of any by-products which could be formed by self-condensation of alcohols. Moreover, the catalyst can be readily recovered and reused up to five times with almost maintained reactivity and yields.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electrochemical oxidation of 2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,4-dione (<b>DHP</b>) has been investigated in aqueous and some amphiprotic and aprotic non-aqueous solvents by cyclic voltammetric and controlledpotential coulometric techniques. Our data shows that electrochemically generated phthalazine-1,4-dione (<b>PTD</b>) in water and amphiprotic non-aqueous solvents participates in an oxidative ring cleavage (ORC) reaction to form phthalic acid. The rate of this reaction is dependent. On autoprotolysis constant ($K_{\text{SH}}$) and basicity of the solvent. Therefore, in the aprotic non-aqueous solvents such as acetonitrile and DMSO, the rate of ORC is too slow to be observed on the time-scale of cyclic voltammetry.</p>

				<title>How does fatty acid influence anti-thyroid drugs binding and specificity toward protein human serum albumin? A blind docking simulation study</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1929-1939</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study reports an AutoDock-based blind docking simulation investigation to characterize the binding interaction of a series of anti-thyroid drugs (2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI), 2-thiouracil (TU), 6-methyl-2-thiouracil (MTU), 6-ùëõ-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) with a model plasma protein Human SerumAlbumin (HSA) in the presence and absence of fatty acid (FA). The drug-protein binding efficiency is characterized in terms of binding free energy and the association constant (K<sub>a</sub>, which is estimated as the reciprocal of the inhibition constant, K<sub>i</sub>) of the drugs to the transport protein. The study also unveils the substantial impact of the presence of fatty acid (FA) on the binding interaction process. It is shown that in the presence of FA the drug-protein binding efficiency is markedly enhanced (except for MTU) and the binding location is changed. Hydrogen bonding interaction appears to play a governing role in the process of FA-induced modifications of binding efficiency and location.</p>

					<p>A novel hectorite/poly(AM/IA)nanocomposite hydrogel was synthesized by inverse microemulsion polymerization. The influence of hectorite amount on water absorbency rate, gel strength and shearresistance was investigated. Dynamic viscoelasticity behaviour of the nanocomposite hydrogels was also studied. The nanocomposite hydrogels showed suitable water absorbency and shear-resistance, high gel strength, solid-like behaviour in the whole oscillation frequency region and enhanced viscoelastic behaviours under high stress.

					<p>We demonstrate a new procedure for dealumination of zeolite Y. The method employs a 28 KHz ultrasound bath and an ethanolic acetylacetone solution. Acetylacetone was used as chelating agent and ultrasound irradiation was used as extraction intensifier. Four types of samples, as-synthesized, ammoniumexchanged, acidic and neutralized zeolite were used for dealumination. Parts of the framework aluminumatoms are removed from their sites in the structure of zeolite Y upon the use of either acetylacetone on its own or simultaneous use of acetylacetone and ultrasound waves. Higher dealumination was observed for those samples subjected to both ultrasound irradiation and acetylacetone extraction.</p>

				<title>Recent developments in solar H<sub>2</sub> generation from water splitting</title>
				<feature>Review Articles</feature>
				<page>0033-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogen production from water and sunlight through photocatalysis could become one of the channels, in the not-so-distant future, to meet a part of ever growing energy demands. However, accomplishing solar water splitting through semiconductor particulate photocatalysis seems to be the ‚ÄòHoly Grail‚Äô problem of science. In the present mini-review, some of the critical strategies of semiconductor photocatalysis are focused with the aim of enumerating underlying critical factors such as visible light harvesting, charge carrier separation, conduction and their utilization that determine the quantum efficiency. We attempted to bring out the essential requirements expected in a material for facile water splitting by explaining important and new designs contributed in the last decade. The newly emerged designs in semiconductor architecture employing nanoscience towards meeting the critical factors of facile photocatalysis are elucidated. The importance of band gap engineering is emphasized to utilize potential wide band gap semiconductors. Assistance of metal nanostructures and quantum dots to semiconductors attains vital importance as they are exuberant visible light harvesters and charge carrier amplifiers. Benevolent use of quantum dots in solar water splitting and photoelectrochemical water splitting provides scope to revolutionize the quantum efficiency by its multiple exciton generation features. A list of drawbacks and issues that hamper the much needed breakthrough in photocatalysis of water splitting is provided to invite attention to address them and move towards sustainable water splitting.</p>

				<title>Composition dependent non-ideality in aqueous binary mixtures as a signature of avoided spinodal decomposition</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0049-0059</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We explore the potential energy landscape of structure breaking binary mixtures (SBBM) where two constituents dislike each other, yet remain macroscopically homogeneous at intermediate to high temperatures. Interestingly, we find that the origin of strong composition dependent non-ideal behaviour lies in its phase separated inherent structure. The inherent structure (IS) of SBBM exhibits bi-continuous phase as is usually formed during spinodal decomposition.We draw analogy of this correlation between non-ideality and phase separation in IS to explain observation of non-ideality in real aqueous mixtures of small amphiphilic solutes, containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. Although we have not been able to obtain IS of these liquids, we find that even at room temperature these liquids sustain formation of fluctuating, transient bicontinuous phase, with limited lifetime ($\tau \lesssim$ 20 ps). While in the model (A, B) binary mixture, the non-ideal composition dependence can be considered as a fluctuation from a phase separated state, a similar scenario is expected to be responsible for the unusually strong non-ideality in these aqueous binary mixtures.</p>

				<title>Solvent sorting in (mixed solvent + electrolyte) systems: Time-resolved fluorescence measurements and theory</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0061-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this manuscriptwe explore electrolyte-induced modification of preferential solvation of a dipolar solute dissolved in a binary mixture of polar solvents. Composition dependence of solvation characteristics at a fixed electrolyte concentration has been followed. Binary mixtures of two different polarities have been employed to understand the competition between solute-ion and solute-solvent interactions. Time-resolved fluorescence Stokes shift and anisotropy have been measured for coumarin 153 (C153) in moderately polar (ethyl acetate + 1-propanol) and strongly polar (acetonitrile + propylene carbonate) binary mixtures at various mixture compositions, and in the corresponding 1.0M solutions of LiClO<sub>4</sub>. Both the mixtures show red shifts in C153 absorption and fluorescence emission upon increase of mole fraction of the less polar solvent component in presence of the electrolyte. In addition, measured average solvation times become slower and rotation times faster for the above change in the mixture composition. A semi-molecular theory based on solution density fluctuations has been developed and found to successfully capture the essential features of the measured Stokes shift dynamics of these complex multi-component mixtures. Dynamic anisotropy results have been analyzed by using both Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) and Dote-Kivelson-Schwartz (DKS) theories. The importance of local solvent structure around the dissolved solute has been stressed.</p>

				<title>Excited electronic state decomposition mechanisms of clusters of dimethylnitramine and aluminum</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0071-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this report, electronically non-adiabatic decomposition pathways of clusters of dimethylnitramine and aluminum (DMNA-Al and DMNA-Al<sub>2</sub>) are discussed in comparison to isolated dimethylnitramine (DMNA). Electronically excited state processes of DMNA-Al and DMNA-Al<sub>2</sub> are explored using the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and the restricted active space self-consistent field (RASSCF) theories, respectively. Similar to the nitro-nitrite isomerization reaction pathway of DMNA, DMNA-Al$_n$ clusters also exhibit isomerization pathway. However, it involves several other steps, such as, first Al-O bond dissociation, then N-N bond dissociation followed by isomerization and finally NO elimination. Furthermore, DMNA-Al$_n$ clusters exhibit overall exothermic decomposition reaction pathway and isolated DMNA shows overall endothermic reaction channel.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Relevance of anion-ùúã interactions in chloride, bromide, nitrate and perchlorate salts of 5-(hydroxyimino)quinolin-8-one are discussed. Structures of nitrate salt of 5-aminoquinoline as well as nitrate salt of 4-hydroxyquinazoline are compared with the structure of nitrate salt of 5-(hydroxyimino)quinolin-8-one. From such a comparison, two different arrangements of nitrate ions with respect to the respective cations are discerned. Nitrate ions are sandwiched between aromatic planes of cations in nitrate salts of 5-(hydroxyimino)quinolin-8-one or 4-hydroxyquinazoline; whereas, nitrate ions are in oblique positions with respect to aromatic planes of counter cations in nitrate salt of 5-aminoquinoline. Binding constants of different nitrate salts in solution are determined by UV-visible spectroscopic titrations. Solution study shows formation of ion-pairs of these salts in solution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polyoxometalates with lacunary Keggin structure modified with transition metal ions [PW<sub>11</sub>O<sub>39</sub>M(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>5‚àí</sup>, where M = Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, were synthesized and supported on activated carbon to obtain the PW11MC catalysts. Using FT-IR and DTA-TGA it was concluded that the [PW<sub>11</sub>O<sub>39</sub>M(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>5‚àí</sup> species are interacting with the functional groups of the support, and that thermal treatment leads to the loss of the coordinatively bonded water molecules without any noticeable anion degradation. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts in the sulfoxidation reaction of 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole, an emerging environmental pollutant, were evaluated. The reaction was carried out in acetonitrile as solvent using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 35&#37; p/v as a clean oxidant. The conversion values decreased in the following order: PW11NiC &#62; PW11CuC &#62; PW11CoC &#62; PW11ZnC, with selectivity to sulfoxide higher than 69&#37;. The catalyst could be reused without appreciable loss of the catalytic activity at least three times. The materials were found to be efficient and recyclable catalysts for 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole sulfoxidation in order to obtain a more biodegradable product than the corresponding substrate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The electrochemical behaviour of Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox couple in 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C<sub>6</sub>mimCl) ionic liquid was studied using glassy carbon electrode at 375 K by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In this electrochemical study, we have made an attempt to avoid the problem of water contamination in hygroscopic C<sub>6</sub>mimCl ionic liquid by setting the temperature at 375 K without glove box. This high temperature cyclic voltammetric study revealed two-step one electron reductions of Cu(II) to Cu(I) followed by Cu(I) to Cu metal. The reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) was found to be quasi-reversible at 375 K. The diffusion coefficients of Cu(II) and Cu(I), and the charge transfer rate constant of Cu(II) in C<sub>6</sub>mimCl were estimated by Randles-≈†evƒçik equation and Nicholson‚Äôs method, respectively, and found to be consistent with the quasi-reversible process. Further, constant potential electrodeposition of metallic copper was carried out on a stainless steel electrode at 375 K and the deposit was characterised by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy.</p>

Electrochemical and Li<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ion exchange behaviour of the synthesized material were studied by cyclic voltametry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and galvanostatic charge-discharge method after preparing a laboratory model cell against lithium anode instead of potassium. During anodic scan in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle, peak maximum was observed at 3.93 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li due to removal of K<sup>+</sup> ions from the ferrocyanide matrix, whereas, in the reverse scan (cathodic sweep) as well as in consequent cycles, peak maxima due to Li+ ion insertion and extraction were observed at 2.46 V and 3.23 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, respectively. Cell, assembled using ferrocyanide cathode and lithium anode, shows an open circuit potential of 3.08 V and delivers a maximum capacity of 61 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> (theoretical capacity 72 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>) at a rate of 0.2 C at room temperature.</p>

					<p>Thiazolidine-2-thione (L<sup>1</sup>,NC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>S<sub>2</sub>) reacted with copper(I) bromide in CH<sub>3</sub>CN under aerobic conditions and transformed through C-S bond cleavage into 3-(2-thiazolin-2-yl)thiazolidine-2-thione (L<sup>2</sup>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>S<sub>2</sub>N-C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SN).

				<abstract>
					<p>A simple and efficient approach was developed to fabricate silver dendrites by Cu reducing Ag<sup>+</sup> in AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution. The growth speed, morphologies and structures of the silver dendrites strongly depend on AgNO<sub>3</sub> concentration and reaction time. The silver dendrites were formed from nanosheets and the crystal structure is face-centered cubic. Rhodamine 6G was used as probe molecule to show that the silver dendrites have high sensitivity to surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy response.</p>

					<p>Structural variations of different 2ùúã-aromatic three-membered ring systems of main group elements, especially group 14 and 13 elements as compared to the classical description of cyclopropenyl cation has been reviewed in this article. The structures of heavier analogues as well as group 13 analogues of cyclopropenyl cation showed an emergence of dramatic structural patterns which do not conform to the generalnorms of carbon chemistry. Isolobal analogies between the main group fragments have been efficiently used to explain the peculiarities observed in these three-membered ring systems.</p>

				<title>Frustrated Lewis pairs: Design and reactivity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0241-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interaction of a Lewis acid with a Lewis base results in the formation of a Lewis acid‚Äìbase adduct. Understanding Lewis acids and bases is central to conceptualizing chemical interactions and constitutes a major portion of metal‚Äìligand chemistry. Sterically encumbered/constrained Lewis pairs cannot form acid‚Äìbase adducts, but such ‚ÄòFrustrated Lewis Pairs‚Äô (FLPs), with their unquenched electronic demands can be elegantly used to simultaneously react with a third species, resulting in unusual reactivity of small molecules. Such unusual reactions, explored only in the last few years, have found several applications, e.g., heterolytic splitting of H<sub>2</sub>, activation of small molecules (CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, etc.). FLPs have opened new opportunities in synthetic chemistry, covering organic, main group as well as transition metal chemistry. The design strategies adopted for FLP systems and their unique reactivity are discussed here.</p>

					<p>We report here the syntheses and structural studies of dimeric sodium and potassium complexes of composition [Na(THF)<sub>2</sub>{Ph<sub>2</sub>P(BH<sub>3</sub>)N(2,6-<sup>i</sup>Pr<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)}]<sub>2</sub> (<b>2</b>) and [K(THF)<sub>2</sub>{Ph<sub>2</sub>P(BH<sub>3</sub>)N(2,6-<sub>i</sub>Pr<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)}]<sub>2</sub>(<b>3</b>). The sodium complex <b>2</b> was readily prepared by the reaction of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide with 2,6-diisopropylanilidophosphine-borane ligand [2,6-<sup>i</sup>Pr<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>NHP(BH<sub>3</sub>)Ph<sub>2</sub>] (<b>1-H</b>) at ambient temperature. The potassium complex <b>3</b> was prepared by two synthetic routes: in the first method, the ligand <b>1-H</b> was made to react with potassium hydride at room temperature to afford the corresponding potassium complex. The potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amides were made to react with protic ligand <b>1-H</b> in the second method to eliminate the volatile bis(trimethyl)silyl amine. Solid-state structures of both the new complexes were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In the molecular structures of complexes <b>2</b>, the sodium metal is coordinated by the anilido nitrogen (ùúÇ<sup>1</sup>) and borane group (ùúÇ<sup>1</sup>) attached to the phosphorus atom of ligand <b>1</b>. In contrast, for compound <b>2</b>, ligand <b>1</b> displays ùúÇ<sup>6</sup>ùúã-arene interaction from 2,6-diisopopylphenyl ring with potassium atom along with ùúÇ<sup>3</sup> interaction of BH<sub>3</sub> group due to larger ionic radius of potassium ion.</p>

				<title>Role of ligands in controlling the regioselectivity in ruthenium-catalysed addition of carboxylic acids to terminal alkynes: A DFT study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0281-0293</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density functional studies are performed to understand the role of chelating <i>bi</i>-phosphine ligands [(Ph<sub>2</sub>P(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>); <i>m</i>=1‚Äì4] in modulating the regio-selectivity of benzoic acid addition to 1-hexyne, in presence of ruthenium(II) catalyst [(Ph<sub>2</sub>P(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)Ru(methallyl)<sub>2</sub>]. The Markovnikov addition to 1-hexyne is observed when catalyst <b>1<sub>a</sub></b> [(Ph<sub>2</sub>P(CH<sub>2</sub>)PPh<sub>2</sub>)Ru(methallyl)<sub>2</sub>] is employed, whereas a reverse regio-selectivity is witnessed in presence of <b>1<sub>d</sub></b> [(Ph<sub>2</sub>P(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>PPh<sub>2</sub>)Ru(methallyl)<sub>2</sub>]. Anti-Markovnikov addition occurs via the neutral vinylidene intermediates (<b>5<sub>a/d</sub></b>) formed after 1,2-hydrogen shift in hexyne coordinated ruthenium(II) complexes <b>3<sub>a/d</sub></b>. The energy profile shows clear preference for Markovnikov addition by 15.0 kcal/mol (ùõ•$G^S$<sub>L</sub>) in case of catalyst system <b>1<sub>a</sub></b>. In contrast, anti-Markovnikov pathway following neutral vinylidenes are more favourable by 9.1 kcal/mol (ùõ•$G^S$<sub>L</sub>) for catalyst system <b>1<sub>d</sub></b>. The <i>Z</i>-enol ester formation is more predominantin the anti-Markovnikov pathway since the activation barrier for this step requires less energy (5.9 kcal/mol, ùõ•$G^S$<sub>L</sub>) than the one furnishing the <i>E</i>-product. The calculated results are in good agreement with the reported experimental findings.</p>

				<page>0307-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrocatalysis is an important phenomenon which is utilized in metal‚Äìair batteries, fuel cells, electrochemical sensors, etc. To increase the efficiency of the electrocatalytic process and to increase the electrochemical accessibility of the immobilized electrocatalysts, functionalized and non-functionalized mesoporous organo-silica (MCM41-type-materials) are used in this study. These materials possess several suitable properties to be durable catalysts and/or catalyst supports. Owing to the uniform dispersion of electrocatalysts (metal complex and/or metal nanoparticles (NPs)) on the functionalized and non-functionalized silica, an enormous increase in the redox current is observed. Long range channels of silica materials with pore diameter of 15‚Äì100 &#197; allowed metal NPs to accommodate in a specified manner in addition to other catalysts. The usefulness of MCM-41-type silica in increasing the efficiency of electrocatalysisis demonstrated by selecting oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrite reduction reactions as examples</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of complex with a general formula of M(Fc<sub>2</sub>Ph<sub>2</sub>P) [Fc<sub>2</sub>Ph<sub>2</sub>P = 5, 10-bisferrocenyl-15,20-bisphenylporphyrin (2‚àí); M = Fe(III)Cl Fe(III)(ClO<sub>4</sub>) and Cu(II)] have been synthesized and characterized. The single crystal X-ray structure of Cu<sup>II</sup>(Fc<sub>2</sub>Ph<sub>2</sub>P) has been reported in which two ferrocene moieties are in <i>anti</i> form with respect to each other. The ferrocenyl groups of Cu<sup>II</sup>(Fc<sub>2</sub>Ph<sub>2</sub>P) are more easily oxidized via a single two-electron quasi-reversible process compared to the free base ligand in which two 1e-oxidative response separated by 0.23 V are observed. Electrochemical study of Fe<sup>III</sup>(Fc<sub>2</sub>Ph<sub>2</sub>P)Cl revealed ferrocenebased two-electron quasi-reversible oxidation at 0.72 V indicating no observable coupling of the ferrocene moieties. The higher oxidation state of Fe(III) reduces the electron releasing tendency of the porphyrin ring and thus make the ferrocene oxidation difficult. The porphyrin, however, lack substituents at the ùõΩ-pyrrolic positions, and the ferrocenyl moieties are therefore free to rotate. The observed electrochemical analyses thus demonstrate that the oxidation of the ferrocene subunit is strongly affected by porphyrin ring as well as the central metal through extended ùúã-conjugation.</p>

The ligand can selectively recognize Al<sup>3+</sup> through enhancement in the fluorescence intensity and this in <i>situ</i> formed aluminium complex recognizes fluoride through quenching of fluorescence. The receptor system detects fluoride in nanomolar range. The sensing property was extended for practical utility to sense fluoride in tap water, pond water and river water.</p>

				<title>Structures, bonding and reactivity of iron and manganese high-valent metal-oxo complexes: A computational investigation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0343-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Iron and manganese ions with terminal oxo and hydroxo ligands are discovered as key intermediates in several synthetic and biochemical catalytic cycles. Since many of these species possess vigorous catalytic abilities, they are extremely transient in nature and experiments which probe the structure and bonding on such elusive species are still rare. We present here comprehensive computational studies on eight iron and manganese oxo and hydroxo (Fe<sup>III/IV/V</sup>-O, Fe<sup>III</sup>-OH and Mn<sup>III/IV/V</sup>-O, Mn<sup>III</sup>-OH) species using dispersion corrected (B3LYP-D2) density functional method. By computing all the possible spin states for these eight species, we set out to determine the ground state <i>S</i> value of these species; and later on employing MO analysis, we have analysed the bonding aspects which contribute to the high reactivity of these species. Direct structural comparison to iron and manganese-oxo species are made and the observed similarity and differences among them are attributed to the intricate metal‚Äìoxygen bonding. By thoroughly probing the bonding in all these species, their reactivity towards common chemical reactions such as C‚ÄìH activation and oxygen atom transfer are discussed.</p>

					<p>A new series of biphenylene ethynylene co-polymers, poly(2,5-dialkoxy-4-phenyleneethynylene-4,4-biphenyleneethynylene)s of the general formula [-C&#8801;-4-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-4-C&#8801;C-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(2,5-OR)<sub>2</sub>-]<sub>n</sub> (R=C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub> <b>P1</b>, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub> <b>P2</b>) has been synthesized using a palladium/copper catalyzed coupling reaction between HC&#8801;-4-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-4-C&#8801;C-H and IC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(2,5-OR)<sub>2</sub>I. The new co-polymer [-C&#8801;C-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(2,5-OC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-C&#8801;C-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(2,5-OC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-]<sub>n</sub> <b>P5</b> has also been formed where different alkoxy substituents are present on alternate arene rings in the same polymer backbone. All the polymers were characterized by IR, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy and by GPC. The model compounds C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-4-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-C&#8801;C-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(2,5-OR)<sub>2</sub>-4-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> (R=C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub> <b>M1</b>, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub> <b>M2</b>) have also been prepared by the reaction between C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-4-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-C&#8801;CH and IC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(2,5-OR)<sub>2</sub>I.

				<title>Carbazole-based sensitizers for potential application to dye sensitized solar cells</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0383-0394</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two push-pull molecules employing carbazole and alkyl thiophene (CAR-THIOHX) or carbazole and triphenylamine (CAR-TPA) as donor moieties, with the cyanoacrylic group as the acceptor, have been designed and synthesized by simple organic transformations. Photophysical and electrochemical studies revealed the potential of these two systems in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Under standard irradiation conditions, <b>CAR-TPA</b> and <b>CAR-THIOHX</b> exhibited 2.12 and 1.83&#37; of overall power conversion efficiencies respectively. The moderate photovoltaic efficiency of the sensitizers has been attributed to the poor light absorption of the sensitizers in the visible region. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown a strong intramolecular charge transfer character, with the HOMOs of both the sensitizers exclusively localized on the corresponding donor moieties and LUMOs on the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. On the other hand, the calculated high dihedral angle between the carbazole donor and the phenyl bridge for these sensitizers impedes the conjugation along the dyes backbone, and thus leads to less extended and intense absorption spectra in the visible region.</p>

					<p>Three donor-ùúã-acceptor (D-ùúã-A) dyes (P1‚ÄìP3) of polymeric metal complexes were synthesized for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These D-ùúã-A sensitizers use Phenothiazine appended with octyl as donor (D), C=C bond as ùúã-bridge(ùúã), and thiophene-phenanthroline metal complexes as acceptor (A) that can be anchored to the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface. They have been characterized and studied by FT-IR, GPC, Elemental analysis, TGA, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. When applied in the DSSCs, the sensitizer P1 exhibits the best energy conversion efficiency of 1.57&#37; (Jsc = 4.12 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, Voc = 0.62 V, FF = 61.7&#37;) under simulate AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The TGA data show that these new dyes own good thermal stability. These results will facilitate the understanding of the crucial importance of molecular engineering and pave a new path to design novel conjugated organic polymer dye for highly efficient and stable DSSCs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Five 3-Hydroxychromones (3HCs), namely, 2-(furan-2-yl)-3-hydroxy-4<i>H</i>-chromen-4-one (FHC) and its four derivatives by substitution of -CH<sub>3</sub>, -OH, -NO<sub>2</sub> and -Cl at 6<sup>th</sup> position were synthesized from their corresponding 2‚Äô-hydroxyacetophenone and furan-2-carboxaldehyde. Various spectral transitions of all these 3-hydroxychromones (3-HCs) have been assigned by interpreting their absorption spectra in cyclohexane, acetonitrile and methanol. It has been shown that the electromeric effects of substitution at 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> positions on the 2‚Äì3 double bond in `C‚Äô ring are similar but the effect on the double bond of 4-carbonyl group is opposite. It has been found that the substitution at 2<sup>nd</sup> position changes mainly the electron density directly at the 4-carbonyl group and substitution at 6<sup>th</sup> position changes the electron density of the `C‚Äô ring, changing the overall dipole moment of the molecule, which in turn changes the electron density at the 4-carbonyl group. Emission spectral studies showed that the increase and decrease in dipole moment by substitution at 6<sup>th</sup> position with electron withdrawing group like NO<sub>2</sub> and electron donating group like -CH<sub>3</sub> and -OH, stabilizes and destabilizes the N<sup>&#42;</sup> state in the polar solvents respectively</p>

					<p>A new ammonium acetate-assisted, convenient and efficient procedure for the synthesis of arylidene derivatives of thiazolopyrimidine is described. The main advantages of this protocol is that it is economical, short reaction time, commonly available chemicals, and ease of isolation of products. In addition, a new series of thiazole-fused pyrimidines were synthesized and hydrolysis of one of its arylidene derivative studied. All the compounds were characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods. Further, the structure of hydrolyzed product and two other compounds were confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analysis. The crystal structures are stabilized by intermolecular C-H...O, C-H...N, C-H... ùúã and ùúã ...ùúã weak interactions. The anti-microbial screening was done on the compounds in order to test their anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Powder samples of Ag/ZnO nanocomposite containing different amounts of Ag were synthesized by co-precipitation method. The synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX and TEM techniques. The XRD results revealed that all the samples show wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO. The TEM micrographs of the samples showed that size of Ag-ZnO nanoparticles was in the range of 30‚Äì50 nm. Catalytic activity was tested using liquid-phase selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. The influence of some parameters such as optimum weight of Ag, catalyst dosage, oxidant and various solvents were studied. The superior catalytic performance of the Ag/ZnO nanocomposite was observed in microwave condition compared to that performed in reflux condition. The catalysts were recycled three times in the oxidation of alcohols and little change in the conversion efficiency was observed. The highly dispersed Ag metal particles on ZnO surface was considered to be responsible for the catalytic activity.</p>

					<p>This article presents the fabrication of FeSe thin films from a single source precursor namely (1-(2-fluorobenzoyl)-3-(4-ferrocenyl-3-methylphenyl)selenourea (MeP2F)) by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD). All the films were prepared via similar experimental conditions (temperature, flow rate, concentration, solvent system and reactor type) except the use of three different concentrations of two different surfactants i.e., triton and span. Seven thin films were characterized with PXRD, SEM, AFM, EDS and EDS mapping. The mechanism of the interaction of surfactant with MeP2F was determined with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV-Vis spectroscopy.</p>

				<title>Structural and optical properties of zinc titanates synthesized by precipitation method</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0509-0518</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis of zinc titanates was carried out using a simple precipitation method followed by calcination at different temperatures to obtain different phases of the material. The phase transition characteristics, presence of functional groups, structural aspects and optical bandgaps with respect to calcination temperature were studied by thermal analysis, EDAX, FT-IR, powder XRD, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy respectively. The compound on heat treatment at 100&#176;C for 24 h showed broadened peaks in XRD.With increasing temperature of calcination, the compound appeared to turn to crystalline phase and cubic ZnTiO<sub>3</sub> phase was observed at 600&#176;C. Partial phase transformation of cubic phase ZnTiO<sub>3</sub> into hexagonal ilmenite type ZnTiO<sub>3</sub> was observed in the temperature range 700&#176;C to 900&#176;C. At 1000&#176;C both cubic and hexagonal ilmenite phases decomposed into cubic phase Zn<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub> and rutile TiO<sub>2</sub>. FT-IR showed M-O bonds in the range of 400 cm<sup>‚àí1</sup> to 700 cm<sup>‚àí1</sup>. Raman spectra of cubic defect spinel ZnTiO<sub>3</sub> and cubic inverse spinel Zn<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub> were found to be similar. The optical bandgap calculated using diffuse reflectance spectra was found to be in the range of 3.59 to 3.84 eV depending on calcination temperature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, modified LDH (M-LDH) was synthesized by the co-precipitation reaction of Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O, Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O and <i>N</i>-tetrabromophthaloyl-glutamic (Br-Gl) in short time. M-LDH nanofillers were embedded into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix via ultrasonic irradiation technique which provided PVA/M-LDH NCs. The morphology and structure of the prepared samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques TGA of the PVA/M-LDH NCs showed that the thermal stability was improved. The enhancement of thermal properties was ascribed to the homogeneous and good dispersion of M-LDH sheets in the PVA matrix by hydrogen bonding between O‚ÄìH groups of PVA and the M-LDH.</p>

				<title>Manganese zinc ferrite nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for wet peroxide oxidation of organic aqueous wastes</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Manganese substituted zinc nanoparticles, Mn<sub>x</sub>Zn<sub>1‚àíx</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (x = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) prepared by sol gel method were found to be efficient catalysts for wet peroxide oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. Complete degradation of the target pollutant occurred within 90 min at 70&#176;C. Zinc substitution enhanced the catalytic efficiency and the unsubstituted ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> oxidized the target compound completely within 45 min. Studies on the effect of reaction variables revealed that only a small amount of the oxidant, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (3‚Äì4 mL) is required for complete degradation of 4-chlorophenol. More than 80&#37; of 4-chlorophenol was removed at catalyst concentrations of 100 mg/L. Direct correlation between the amount of catalyst present and the extent of degradation of 4-chlorophenol was observed, ruling out hesterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism. The catalysts are reusable and complete degradation of target pollutant occurred after five successive runs. The extent of iron leaching was fairly low after five consecutive cycles indicating the mechanism to be heterogeneous.</p>

				<title>A DFT study on the mechanism of palladium-catalyzed divergent reactions of 1,6-enyne carbonates</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0547-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction mechanisms of palladium-catalyzed divergent reactions of 1,6-enyne carbonates have been investigated using DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) (LanL2DZ for Pd) level. Solvent effects on these reactions have been considered by the polarizable continuum model (PCM) for the solvent (DMF). The formation of vinylidenepyridines and vinylidenepyrrolidines were generated through 5-exo-dig cyclization or 6-endo-dig cyclization. Our calculation results suggested the following: (i) The first step of the whole cycle is the rate-determining step, which causes allenic palladium intermediate through two plausible pathways. This intermediate provides the corresponding products and releases the palladium catalyst by a subsequent hydrogen transfer and elimination process. (ii) For the catalyst CH<sub>3</sub>OPdH, the reaction could occur through two possible pathways, but 5-exo-dig cyclization is favoured over 6-endo-dig cyclization. However, when the hydrogen atom is substituted with a phenyl group, the energy barriers for 5-exo-dig cyclization or 6-endo-dig cyclization become relatively high, 18.0‚Äì28.5 kcal/mol. The computational results provide good explanation for the experimental observations.</p>

				<title>Atomistic understanding of hydrogen loading phenomenon into palladium cathode: A simple nanocluster approach and electrochemical evidence</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0575-0581</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inherent potency of palladium to sorb hydrogen atoms was examined empirically and theoretically through various electrochemical methods and high-level quantum chemical calculations (HSE06) based on cluster model (CM) and density functional theory (DFT). The CM-DFT approach using QZVP/cc-PV6Z basis sets revealed a strong attraction between Pd nanoclusters and H atoms that generates some charged entities. This atomistically justifies why the electrochemical impedance of the system becomes less by the loading phenomenon. It is concluded that hydrogen atoms enter the palladium subsurface through hollow and bridge sites by diffusing as proton-like species and get loaded predominantly in the octahedral voids.</p>

					<p>A facile method for the synthesis of a series of cyclometallated ruthenium(II) carbonyl complexes with 1-pyrenaldehyde 4-<i>R</i>-3-thiosemicarbazones (H<sub>2</sub>L<sup>n</sup> where the two H‚Äôs represent the dissociable thioamide and pyrenyl protons; <i>R</i> = H, Me and Ph) has been described. The characterization of the complexes having the general molecular formula <i>trans</i>-[Ru(L<sup>n</sup>)(CO)(EPh<sub>3</sub>3)<sub>2</sub>] (where E = P or As) were accomplished by elemental (CHN) analysis, magnetic susceptibility and spectroscopic (ESI-MS, IR, UV-Vis, emission and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR) measurements. Electronic spectra of the complexes display multiple strong absorptions in the range 440‚Äì224 nm due to intraligand transitions. All the complexes exhibit emission bands that are characteristic of ligand centred emissive states. X-ray diffraction studies with representative complexes reveal a pincer-like 5,5-membered fused chelate rings forming CNS coordination mode of the thiosemicarbazonate ligand (L<sup>n</sup>)<sup>2‚àí</sup> <i>via</i> regioselective activation of 1-pyrenyl <i>ortho</i> C‚ÄìH and formation of a distorted octahedral C<sub>2</sub>NSE<sub>2</sub> coordination sphere around the ruthenium(II) centre.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nickel(II) complexes containing thiosemicarbazone ligands [Ni(L)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>1-3</b>) (L = 9,10-phenanthrenequinonethiosemicarbazone (HL<sub>1</sub>), 9,10-phenanthrenequinone-N-methylthio semicarbazone (HL<sub>2</sub>) and 9, 10-phenanthrenequinone-N-phenylthiosemicarbazone (HL<sub>3</sub>)) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic (IR, UV-Vis, <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and ESI mass) methods. The molecular structures of complexes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> were identified by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The analysis revealed that the complexes possess a distorted octahedral geometry with the ligand coordinating in a uni-negative tridentate ONS fashion. The catalytic activity of complexes towards some C‚ÄìC coupling reactions (viz., Kumada-Corriu, Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira) has been examined. The complexes behave as efficient catalysts in the Kumada-Corriu and Sonogashira coupling reactions rather than Suzuki-Miyaura coupling.</p>

They are 1:2 electrolytes in aqueous DMF. The diamagnetic complexes exhibit metal to ligand charge transfer band near 570 nm in DMF. The complexes are avid binders to calf thymus DNA giving binding constant (ùêæ<sub>b</sub>) values of &#8764;10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>‚àí1</sup> suggesting significant intercalative DNA binding of the complexes due to presence of planar phenanthroline bases. Complex <b>2</b> exhibits significant photocytotoxicity in immortalized human keratinocyte cells HaCaT and breast cancer cell line MCF-7 giving IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.08 and 13 ùúáM in visible light (400‚Äì700 nm). Complex <b>2</b> shows only minor dark toxicity in HaCaT cells but is non-toxic in dark in MCF-7 cancer cells. The light-induced cellular damage follows apoptotic pathway on generation of reactive oxygen species as evidenced from the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay.</p>

				<title>A tetrakis(amido)phosphonium cation containing 2-pyridyl (<sup>2</sup>Py) substituents,[P(NH<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and its reactivity studies with Ag(I) salts</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0619-0626</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Poly-imido analogues of various phosphorus oxo anions have gained recent attention in inorganic chemistry. Current methods to obtain these anions require strong organometallic deprotonating agents in reaction with phosphonium salt like [(NHPh)<sub>4</sub>P]Cl or phosphoramides such as [(RNH)<sub>3</sub>P=E] (E = NSiMe<sub>3</sub>, O, S or Se) in non-polar solvents. Recently, employing salts of soft and reactive transition metal ions, we have developed methods to obtain these anions in polar and protic solvents. Herein, we have described a facile anion exchange route that stabilizes the highly labile tetrakis(2-pyridylamino)phosphonium cation as its nitrate salt, [P(NH<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>4</sub>]NO<sub>3</sub>. This molecule exhibits a double chain structure mediated by H-bonding interactions of the pyridylamino segments (N-H...N). The phosphonium salt upon reaction with excess silver triflate results in a pentanuclear Ag(I) complex, {Ag<sub>5</sub>[P(N<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>2</sub>]}¬∑(F<sub>3</sub>CSO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, stabilized by two imido-phosphinate [P(N<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>‚àí</sup> ligands. Formation of a similar penta-nuclear cluster has been observed before when AgClO<sub>4</sub> was used as a base. Our previous results with the related phosphate precursor, [PO(NH<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>3</sub>], in reaction with various Ag(I) salts have shown to yield complexes of the corresponding neutral, mono- and dianionic ligands. However, the stability of the Ag5-cluster within the mono-anionic casing of the [P(N<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sup>2</sup>Py)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>‚àí</sup> ligand have seemingly overwhelmed the subtle reactivity changes offered by various Ag(I) salts.</p>

				<title>Reversible structural transformations in a Co(II)-based 2D dynamic metal-organic framework showing selective solvent uptake</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0627-0633</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A Co(II)-based two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) [Co(pca)(bdc)<sub>0.5</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>1</b>) {pca = pyrazine carboxylic acid, and bdc = 1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid} was synthesized solvothermally. The compound loses the coordinated lattice water molecules on heating which is accompanied by solidstate structural transformation to yield dehydrated phase [Co(pca)(bdc)0.5] (<b>1&#8242;</b>). The hydrated structure can be regained by exposing <b>1&#8242;</b> to water vapour (<b>1&#8242;&#8242;</b>). These reversible solid-state structural transformations are accompanied by a visible colour change in the material. The dehydrated compound also shows highly selective water uptake over other solvents like MeOH, EtOH, THF. This selective water uptake can be ascribed to the high affinity of polar water molecule towards the open metal site created on heating. The present report provides important insights into the reversible structural transformations observed due to variable coordination number of the central metal ion and transformability of the framework. The selective water uptake over alcohols along with visible colour change demonstrates the potential of the present compound in bio-alcohol purification.</p>

					<p>Synthesis of phosphorus containing polyethers and their lithium-ion conductivities for the potential use as solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) in high-energy density lithium-ion batteries have been described. Co-polymerization of butyl bis(hydroxymethyl)phosphine oxide with three different dibromo monomers were carried out to produce three novel phosphorous containing polyethers (<b>P1‚ÄìP3</b>). These polymers were obtained via nucleophilic substitution reactions and were characterized by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectral data and gel permeation chromatography. SPEs were prepared using polyethers (<b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b>) with various amounts of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI).

					<p>We have synthesized two isostructural mononuclear cobalt(III) complexes [<b>1</b>]NO<sub>3</sub>¬∑3H<sub>2</sub>O and [<b>1</b>]NO<sub>3</sub>¬∑CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H¬∑H<sub>2</sub>O {[<b>1</b>]<sub>+</sub> = [Co(1,10-phenanthroline)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>} and characterized by single crystal X-ray structural analyses. Mass spectral studies of the complexes indicate both the compounds to produce identical cationic species viz., [Co(phen)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> in methanol solution. [<b>1</b>]<sup>+</sup> has been evaluated as model system for the catechol oxidase enzyme by using 3,5-<i>di</i>-tert-butylcatechol (3,5-DTBC) as the substrate in methanol medium, which revealed that the cationic complex efficiently inhibits catalytic activity with k<sub>cat</sub> value 9.65 &#215; 10<sup>2</sup> h<sup>‚àí1</sup>. [<b>1</b>]<sup>+</sup> cleaved pBR 322 DNA without addition of an activating agent. Further, the anti-cancer activity of [<b>1</b>]<sup>+</sup> on human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) has been examined. The induction of apoptosis induced in the cell line was assessed base on the changes in cell morphology, which showed the efficacy of [<b>1</b>]<sup>+</sup> to induce apoptosis in 53% of cells during 24 h treatment. Interestingly, the observed IC<sub>50</sub> values reveal that [<b>1</b>]<sup>+</sup> brings about conformational change on DNA strongly and exhibits remarkable cytotoxicity.</p>

					<p>series of antipodal ùõΩ-trisubstituted <i>meso</i>-tetraphenylporphyrins, H<sub>2</sub>TPP(R)<sub>3</sub> (R = CH<sub>3</sub>, Ph, PE, and 2&#8242;-thienyl) derivatives and their metal (Cu(II) and Zn(II)) complexes were synthesised and characterised by electronic absorption, <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The magnitude of the red-shift in absorption bands in these free-base porphyrins depend on the nature of the substituent and follow the general trend: PE &#62; 2&#8242; &#62; Ph &#62; CH<sub>3</sub>. Synthesis, characterisation and crystal structure of 2,5,10,12,15,20-hexaphenylporphinato zinc(II) bispyridinate, ZnTPP(Ph)<sub>2</sub>(Py)<sub>2</sub> complex is also reported. It shows planar geometry of the porphyrin ring with two ùõΩ-phenyls located at the antipodal 2,12-pyrrole positions. The two axially coordinated pyridine ring planes are oriented almost parallel to each other and they are in staggered conformation relative to opposite pyrrolic nitrogens.

				<abstract>
					<p>A new bidentate Schiff base ligand (HL<sup>1</sup>), containing O,N donors was prepared by the reaction of sulfamethoxazole with 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR. The copper complex of this ligand was synthesised by treating DMF-ethanolic mixture solution of the ligand of two equivalents with one equivalent of copper acetate. The complex was characterized on the basis of UV, FT-IR, molar conductance, EPR, magnetic moment and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, the crystal structure of the octahedral complex showed two solvent molecules (DMF) as ligands at their axial positions. The molar conductance data revealed that the complex is a non-electrolyte. The Schiff base and its copper complex have been investigated as anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents against various microorganisms. The <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity tests of the ligand and its copper complex were carried out in two different human tumour cell lines, HCT-116 and MDA ‚Äì MB - 231. The cytotoxicity studies showed that the complex exhibited higher activity than cisplatin and carboplatin towards MDA ‚Äì MB ‚Äì 231.</p>

All the synthesized compounds are characterized by spectroscopic methods, elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. The authentication of Schiff base modified silatranes is scrutinized by single X-ray crystal structure of silatrane <b>1</b>.

				<title>Synthesis of ùõΩ-aryl-ùõæ-lactones and relationship: Structure ‚Äì antifeedant and antifungal activity</title>

				<page>0687-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eighteen racemic ùõΩ-aryl-ùõæ-lactones derived from simple aromatic aldehydes have been obtained in the chemical synthesis. Iodolactones (<b>5c</b> and <b>6c</b>) were synthesized from (ùê∏)-4-(benzo[ùëë][1&#8242;,3&#8242;]-dioxol-5&#8242;-yl)- but-3-en-2-one (<b>1</b>). Reductive dehalogenation of iodolactones <b>5a‚Äìc</b> and <b>6a‚Äìc</b> afforded ùõæ-ethyl-ùõæ-lactones (<b>7a‚Äìc, 8a‚Äìc</b>) whereas the unsaturated lactones (<b>9a‚Äìc, 10a‚Äìc</b>) were obtained by dehydrohalogenation of iodolactones. All synthesized lactones were fully characterized by spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, HRMS) and subjected to the tests on the antifeedant activity towards <i>Tribolium confusum, Trogoderma granarium</i> and <i>Sitophilus granaries</i> as well to the tests on the antifungal activity towards four Fusarium species. The biological tests allowed to find some relationships between the structure and biological activity of the compounds studied. ùõæ-Ethyl-ùõæ-lactones <i>7a‚Äìc</i>, <i>8a‚Äìc</i> and unsaturated lactones <i>9a‚Äìc, 10a-c</i> were usually stronger antifeedants than their parent iodolactones <i>5a‚Äìc</i> and <i>6a‚Äìc</i>. trans-Iodolactones <i>6a‚Äìc</i> were more active than <i>cis</i> isomers <i>5a-c</i> both in antifeedant and antifungal assays. The structure of aromatic substituent was the key factor in antifungal activity. The lactones with benzo [ùëë][1,3]dioxole ring (<i>5c, 6c, 7c, 8c, 9c</i>) were the most active whereas those with unsubstituted benzene ring exhibited almost no activity.</p>

				<title>Studies on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO<sub>2</sub> as soft oxidant over Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/COK-12 catalysts</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0701-0709</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene has been studied over Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> supported on mesoporous silica (COK-12) with CO<sub>2</sub> as soft oxidant in a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range of 723 to 923K. While COK-12 has been prepared by self-assembly method using long chain ionic surfactant i.e., P123 as template, cobalt oxide supported on COK-12 catalysts with variable Co content have been synthesised by simple wet impregnation technique. All the catalysts were characterized by N<sub>2</sub> adsorption - desorption, XRD, FT-IR, TPR, UV-Vis and XPS techniques. XRD and pore size distribution studies indicate the intactness of mesoporous structure of SiO<sub>2</sub> even after incorporation of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Presence of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> crystallites were observed beyond 5 wt&#37; Co loading. High ethylbenzene conversion and stable styrene yields have been observed over 3&#37; Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/COK-12 catalyst due to the presence of large number of active Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalytic sites. Enhancement in the activity has been observed with CO<sub>2</sub> as soft oxidant than with N<sub>2</sub> as diluent. This is because of the fact that the liberated H<sub>2</sub> reacts with CO<sub>2</sub> in the form of reverse water gas shift reaction.</p>

				<title>Ethylene homo- and copolymerization chain-transfers: A perspective from supported (<sup>n</sup>BuCp)<sub>2</sub>ZrCl<sub>2</sub> catalyst active centre distribution</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0717-0728</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Polymerization chain termination reactions and unsaturation of the polymer backbone end are related. Therefore, in this study, the parameters resulting from the modelling of the active centre distribution of the supported catalyst‚Äîsilica/MAO/(<sup>n</sup>BuCp)<sub>2</sub>ZrCl<sub>2</sub>‚Äîwere applied to evaluate the active-centredependent ethylene homo- and copolymerization rates, as well as the corresponding chain termination rates. This approach, from a microkinetic mechanistic viewpoint, elucidates better the 1-hexene-induced positive comonomer effect and chain transfer phenomenon. The kinetic expressions, developed on the basis of the proposed polymerization mechanisms, illustrate how the active site type-dependent chain transfer phenomenon is influenced by the different apparent termination rate constants and momoner concentrations. The active centrespecific molecular weight M<sub>ni</sub> (for the above homo- and copolymer), as a function of chain transfer probability, pCT<sub>i</sub>, varied as follows: <i>log</i>(pCT<sub>i</sub>) = <i>log</i>(mw<sub>ru</sub>)‚àí<i>log</i>(M<sub>ni</sub>) where mw<sub>ru</sub> is the molecular weight of the repeat unit. The physical significance of this finding has been explained. The homo- and copolymer backbones showed all the three chain end unsaturations (vinyl, vinylidene, and trans-vinylene). The postulated polymerization mechanisms reveal the underlying polymer chemistry. The results of the present study will contribute to develop in future supported metallocene catalysts that will be useful to synthesize polyethylene precursors having varying chain end unsaturations, which can be eventually used to prepare functional polyethylenes.</p>

				<title>Development and characterization of stabilized, polymerized phospholipid bilayers on silica particles for specific immobilization of His-tagged proteins</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0729-0735</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stabilized phospholipid bilayer (PLB) coated silica microspheres were prepared via polymerization of lipid monomers. These lipid coated silica microspheres are stable to both extended storage in solution at 4&#176;C and dry storage at room temperature. These stabilized lipid coated microspheres have also been functionalized with nickel-chelating lipids, a commonly used tool for immobilizing polyhistidine-tagged proteins. It is shown that 6xHis-EGFP interacts with (poly)bis-SorbPC/DOGS-NTA-Ni<sup>2+</sup> coated silica and this interaction was interrupted by washing with imidazole indicating the reversibility of the interaction. No interaction was observed between the functionalized silica substrate and EGFP, which lacks the 6xHis-tag. Furthermore, these biocompatible (poly)bis-SorbPC coated microspheres were able to minimize non-specific protein adsorption.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An unsymmetrical and non-coplaner heterocyclic phosphorus containing dicarboxylic acid monomer, (<b>DCA-3</b>) is successfully synthesized with high purity. A series of novel aromatic poly(amide-imide)s having ether or/sulphur or/fluorine or/phosphorus containing phenyl moieties in their backbone are then prepared via a direct phosphorylation polycondensation of synthesized dicarboxylic acid with various aromatic diamines. Chemical structures of <b>DCA-3</b> as well as resulting polymers are confirmed by FT-IR, NMR spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. These polymers are readily soluble in a variety of aprotic polar solvents such as NMP, DMSO, DMAc and DMF, etc. UV spectra showed that all poy(amide-imide)s films exhibit high optical transparency. In addition, the glass transition temperatures (T<sub>g</sub>) of these polymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and found in the range 271‚Äì346&#176;C. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis of these polymers showed good thermal stability, 10&#37; weight loss at temperature in excess of 538&#176;C and char yield at 700&#176;C in nitrogen ranging from 68 to 79&#37;. From wide-angle X-ray diffraction experiments, all polymers showed amorphous behaviour.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Our recent achievements concerning the synthesis and characterization of water soluble peroxo complexes of V(V) and Mo(VI) in macroligand environment, as well as some key features of biological relevance of these compounds, such as their hydrolytic stability, activity with phosphohydrolase enzyme vis-√†-vis free peroxovanadium (pV) or peroxomolybdenum (pMo) complexes, and their activity in biomimetic oxidative bromination are presented here. Immobilization of pMo species on insoluble polymer matrices viz., amino acid functionalized Merrifield resins and poly(acrylonitrile) on the other hand, afforded a set of heterogeneous catalysts highly effective in facile organic transformations such as selective oxidation of organic sulfides and oxidative bromination of aromatic substrates by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, at ambient temperature. The methodologies are straightforward, high-yielding, halogen-free and the catalysts afford easy regeneration. Our findings illustrate the various features which make the procedures sustainable and synthetically useful.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>New heterocyclic ring systems consisting of (¬±) methanodibenzodiazocine and imidazolium/benzimidazolium salts were synthesized in very good yield. Subsequently, these halide salts were subjected to the anion exchange reaction with KPF<sub>6</sub> to yield the corresponding azolium salts in excellent yield. The possible applications of these newly prepared salts were investigated in homogeneous catalysis. Remarkable changes in the catalytic activity were observed by varying the bulkiness of N-substituent at imidazole. Catalytic activity of these newly prepared salts was tested for the benzoin condensation reaction. Exclusive formation of benzoin products were observed in good yield. Similarly, the dimerization of cyclohexen-1-one to Baylis-Hillman type product, 2-(3-oxocyclohexyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-one was studied.</p>

				<title>Liquid phase conversion of Glycerol to Propanediol over highly active Copper/Magnesia catalysts</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0833-0842</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, a series of Cu/MgO catalysts with different copper metal loading were prepared by the precipitation-deposition method. Their catalytic behaviour was investigated for glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO). The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as BET surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), NH<sub>3</sub>-temperature programmed desorption (NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The characterization results showed that the copper metal was well-dispersed over MgO support and a new phase Cu-MgO was also identified from XRD results after calcination. The 25Cu/MgO (Cu:25 wt%) catalyst exhibited the highest glycerol conversion of 88.7% and 1,2-PDO selectivity of 91.7% at 210$^{\circ}$C, 4.5MPa of hydrogen pressure after 12 h. The high glycerol conversion was mainly due to the Cu dispersion on MgO support and high acidic strength. Further, the effects of temperature, hydrogen pressure, catalyst loading and glycerol concentration were studied over 25Cu/MgO catalyst for optimization of reaction parameters. Kinetic study over highly active 25Cu/MgO catalyst showed that the reaction followed the pseudo second order rate with respect to glycerol and the apparent activation energy was found to be 28.7 ¬± 0.8 kcal/mol.</p>

					<p>Calcium carbonate polymorphs were precipitated at room temperature and 80$^{\circ}$C by varying the precipitation pH, carbonate source, effect of solvent in presence and absence of structure directing agent such as para-aminobenzoic acid. Calcite phase of calcium carbonate was obtained when sodium hydrogen carbonate and/or sodium carbonate (used as precipitating agents) were added to calcium chloride solution at different pHs in water and/or methanol as solvent in separate experiments. Vaterite phase of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) has been synthesized by mixing calcium chloride and sodium carbonate in presence of para-aminobenzoic acid when water‚Äìmethanol binary mixture was used as solvent. Vaterite phase of calcium carbonate crystallizes in P63/mmc, while that of calcite phase in R-3mc, respectively. Calcite phase of calcium carbonate exhibits rhombohedral morphology, while vaterite phase has spherical morphology.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The 2-D polymeric complex (<b>I</b>) has the formula [<b>Ag(phSE)(NO<sub>3</sub>)]<sub>n</sub></b>, which has been crystallized from methanol-acetonitrile mixture and characterized by elemental analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In this polymer, each Ag(I) ion occupies distorted trigonal pyramidal geometry coordinating with two sulphur atoms from two different ligands and two oxygen atoms from two NO<sub>3</sub>3 groups. Each NO<sub>3</sub> acts as a bridging ligand coordinating through its two oxygen atoms to different Ag(I) ions. The Ag(I) ion and NO<sub>3</sub> group are in plane with torsion angle 176.43$^{\circ}$. All the ligands adopt anti-conformation but the relative orientation of two -S-C-C-S units is perpendicular to one another such that two phenyl rings attached to the two sulphur atoms coordinating to a particular Ag ion lie on the same side. Each NO<sub>3</sub> bridges two neighbouring Ag ions belonging to two different -S-Ag-S-C-C-S-Ag-S- tapes running along ùëé-axis where two phenyl rings are not parallel to each other to reduce the steric hindrance and maximize packing. The adjacent chains are fused to form 2D sheet by bridging both through bidentate phSE ligand and NO<sub>3</sub> anion stacking in ùëéùëè plane. The structure consists of 4-c uninodal net where Point symbol for Ag (I) ion and net is (4<sup>4</sup>.6<sup>2</sup>) with <b>sql</b> type topology. X-ray diffraction analysis and Hirshfeld surface analysis give rise to comparable results but in Hirshfeld surface analysis, twothird times more close contacts are obtained. The fingerprint plots demonstrate that these weak non-bonding interactions are important for stabilizing the crystal packing.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Nano-TiCl<sub>4</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> was found to be an inexpensive and efficient heterogeneous solid acid catalyst for the synthesis of one-pot cascade synthesis of highly functionalized asymmetric tetrahydropyridines from the five-component condensation reaction of the <i>para</i>-substituted anilines and aromatic aldehydes with ethyl acetoacetate under thermal conditions. Novel methodology, environmentally benign conditions, clean protocol, easy work-up and high yields are the important advantages of this protocol. The products were characterized using physical and spectroscopic data such as FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and in some cases <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and CHN analysis.</p>

				<title>Understanding the surface and structural characteristics of tungsten oxide supported on tin oxide catalysts for the conversion of glycerol</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0897-0908</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Catalysts with varying WO<sub>3</sub> content on SnO<sub>2</sub> were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction, <i>in situ</i> Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption of NH<sub>3</sub>. <i>In situ</i> Raman analysis reveals the presence isolated monomers and polymeric species of WO<sub>3</sub>. These catalysts were evaluated for the conversion of glycerol into value added chemicals. Etherification of glycerol with tertiary butanol and preparation of glycerol carbonate from glycerol and urea are studied over these catalysts. The catalytic activity results suggest that the glycerol conversion and selectivity depends on the morphology of WO<sub>3</sub> which in turn is related to its content in the catalyst. The catalysts with 5 wt.% of WO<sub>3</sub> on SnO<sub>2</sub> resulted in high dispersion with larger number of strong acidic sites. The selectivity in the glycerol etherification is related to the nature of the catalyst and reaction time. These catalysts also exhibited high activity for synthesis of glycerol carbonate. The effect of various reaction parameters was studied to optimize the reaction conditions. The catalysts also exhibited consistent activity upon reuse.</p>

				<title>Textural and morphological studies of transition metal doped SBA-15 by co-condensation method</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0909-0919</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 3d transition metals were incorporated into SBA-15 matrix by co-condensation synthesis method. Very low concentrations of metals were introduced into silica framework by maintaining the metal to silica ratio in the synthesis gel at 0.01. The difference in hydrolysis rates of metal and silica precursors have led to textural modifications while demonstrating the structural integrity akin to pristine SBA-15. The physicochemical properties obtained offer some insights into the P123 micelle aggregation and mechanism of formation of silica network in the presence of metal salts under similar synthesis conditions of pure SBA-15. The metal doping into SBA-15 leads to increased pore diameters. Higher lattice constants (a<sub>0</sub>) observed in these samples are attributed to the increased pore wall thickness. The significant retention of the hexagonal mesostructure seen in LXRD indicates diminutive influence of metal salts at lower concentrations.Macroscopic morphologies studied by SEM show the formation of spheres along with conventional fibre-like rods.</p>

				<title>Effect of optimized structure and electronic properties of some benzimidazole derivatives on corrosion inhibition of mild steel in hydrochloric acid medium: Electrochemical and theoretical studies</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0921-0929</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The corrosion inhibitive action of a few benzimidazole derivatives namely 2-(benzamido) ethylbenzimidazole (BAEBI), 2-(ùõΩ-benzenesulphonamido) ethylbenzimidazole (BSAEBI), 2-(benzamido) methylbenzimidazole (BAMBI) and 2-(ùõΩ-benzenesulphonamido) methylbenzimidazole (BSAMBI), towards mild steel in hydrochloric acid has been studied using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) methods. The results show that these compounds get adsorbed on the mild steel surface following Temkin adsorption isotherm, and act as mixed-type inhibitors. The inhibition efficiencies are found to follow the order, BAEBI &#62; BSAEBI &#62; BAMBI &#62; BSAMBI. This observation is explained in terms of chain length, relative effects of amido and sulphonamido groups, possible structural factors, spatial orientations, energy gap between the frontier molecular orbitals, different intrinsic molecular parameters, like, global hardness and softness, and number of electrons transferred.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we describe the synthesis, biochemical properties and biological activity of a series of new 9-substituted acridine derivatives with a reactive alkene moiety: 9-[(E)-2-phenylethenyl] acridine (<b>1</b>) and methyl (2E)-3-(acridin-9-yl)-prop-2-enoate (<b>2</b>). The interaction of derivatives <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> with calf thymus DNA was investigated using UV-Vis, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The binding constants K were estimated as being in the range of 1.9 to 7.1 $\times 10^5 M^{‚àí1}$, and the percentage of hypochromism was found to be 40‚Äì57% (from spectral titration). UV-Vis, fluorescence, and CD measurements indicate that the compounds were effective DNA-intercalating agents. Electrophoretic separation proved that ligands <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> relaxed topoisomerase I at a concentration of 5 ùúáM. Ester <b>2</b> was shown to have a stronger cytostatic effect on leukemia cell line L1210 than alkene <b>1</b>. The incubation of ligands <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> with the ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 confirmed their extensive cytotoxic effects, an effect which was particularly pronounced in the case of ligand <b>2</b>. Cytotoxicity tests against A2780 cells demonstrate that a conjugate of compound <b>2</b> with ùêø-cysteine (<b>3</b>) is less cytotoxic than compound <b>2</b>, especially at concentrations greater than 10 ùúáM.</p>

				<title>Pt-Pd nanoelectrocatalyst of ultralow Pt content for the oxidation of formic acid: Towards tuning the reaction pathway</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0949-0957</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis of highly efficient functional electrocatalyst that favours the electrochemical oxidation of formic acid via CO-free dehydrogenation pathway is required for direct formic acid fuel cells. Traditional catalysts favour the dehydration pathway involving the generation of poisonous CO. Herein we demonstrate the superior electrocatalytic performance of Pt-Pd bimetallic nanoelectrocatalyst of ultralow Pt content and tuning the reaction pathway by controlling the Pt content. Bimetallic nanoparticles of Pt<sub>4</sub>Pd<sub>96</sub>, Pt<sub>7</sub>Pd<sub>93</sub> and Pt<sub>47</sub>Pd<sub>53</sub> compositions are synthesized by electrochemical co-deposition method in aqueous solution. The nanoparticles of ultralow Pt content, Pt<sub>4</sub>Pd<sub>96</sub>, favour the CO-free dehydrogenation pathway for formic acid oxidation with an onset potential of 0 V (SHE) whereas the Pt<sub>47</sub>Pd<sub>53</sub> nanoparticles favour the dehydration pathway involving the formation of CO at high positive potential. The Pt content of the bimetallic nanoparticles actually controls the oxidation peak potential and catalytic activity. Significant negative shift (‚àº350 mV) in the oxidation peak potential and remarkable enhancement in the current density (2.6 times) are observed for Pt<sub>4</sub>Pd<sub>96</sub> nanoparticles with respect to Pt<sub>47</sub>Pd<sub>53</sub>. The absence of three adjacent Pt and Pd atoms could be the reason for the suppression of CO pathway. The electrochemical impedance measurements indirectly support the CO-free pathway for the formic acid oxidation on Pt<sub>4</sub>Pd<sub>96</sub> nanoparticles.</p>

				<title>Voltammetric determination of wedelolactone, an anti-HIV herbal drug, at boron-doped diamond electrode</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0959-0966</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Boron-doped diamond electrode has been utilized for the study of electrochemical behaviour of an anti-HIV herbal drug wedelolactone in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH-2.5) by square-wave and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The response characteristics of cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry showed a remarkable increase in the anodic peak current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed a lowering in charge transfer resistance at the boron-doped diamond electrode as compared to the glassy carbon electrode that can be attributed to the higher sensitivity of boron-doped diamond sensor. Cyclic voltammetry at the boron-doped diamond surface revealed the oxidation of wedelolactone with two oxidation peaks (P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>) with Ep<sub>1</sub> = 0.4V and Ep<sub>2</sub> =1.00 V with scan rate varying from 10 - 220 mV/s and exhibits diffusion-controlled process. Based on the electrochemical measurements, a probable oxidation mechanism has been deduced and the electrode dynamics parameters have been evaluated. The effect of concentration on the peak currents of wedelolactone was found to have a linear relationship within the concentration range of 50‚Äì700 ng/mL. The LOD and LOQ were found to be 43.87 and 132.93 ng/mL respectively. The applicability of the proposed method was further scrutinized by the successful determination of wedelolactone in real plant samples.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A cost-effective 12 V substrate-integrated lead-carbon hybrid ultracapacitor is developed and performance tested. These hybrid ultracapacitors employ flexible-graphite sheets as negative plate currentcollectors that are coated amperometrically with a thin layer of conducting polymer, namely poly-aniline to provide good adhesivity to activated-carbon layer. The positive plate of the hybrid ultracapacitors comprise conventional lead-sheet that is converted electrochemically into a substrate-integrated lead-dioxide electrode. 12 V substrate-integrated lead-carbon hybrid ultracapacitors both in absorbent-glass-mat and polymeric silicagel electrolyte configurations are fabricated and characterized. It is possible to realize 12 V configurations with capacitance values of ‚àº200 F and ‚àº300 F, energy densities of ‚àº1.9 Wh kg$^{‚àí1}$ and ‚àº2.5 Wh kg$^{‚àí1}$ and power densities of ‚àº2 kW kg$^{‚àí1}$ and ‚àº0.8 kW kg$^{‚àí1}$, respectively, having faradaic-efficiency values of ‚àº90 % with cycle-life in excess of 100,000 cycles. The effective cost of the mentioned hybrid ultracapacitors is estimated to be about ‚àº4 US&#36;/Wh as compared to ‚àº20 US&#36;/Wh for commercially available ultracapacitors.</p>

				<title>A comprehensive study of the structure, tautomeric properties, and conformational flexibility of 3-Hydroxy-propeneselenal</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0999-1006</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present work, a conformational analysis of 3-Hydroxy-propeneselenal is performed using several computational methods, including HF, DFT (B3LYP), and G2MP2 levels of theory. The relative electronic energies, the molecular structure, and intramolecular hydrogen bond energies are reported. Twenty different conformers were obtained, the most stable ones being planar. The conformational preference of this molecule was found to be mainly determined by the formation of Se&#8230;H-O and Se-H&#8230;O intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which are assisted by ùúã-electron resonance. The atoms in molecules (AIM) theory of Bader, which is based on topological properties of the electron density, was used to analyze critical points and to study the nature of hydrogen bonds in these systems. NMR and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were also performed for a better understanding of the nature of intramolecular interactions in 3-Hydroxy-propeneselenal. Furthermore, calculations for all the possible conformations of the title compound in solution were also carried out at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory (in three models such as polarizable continuum model (PCM), IEFPCM, and self‚àíconsistent isodensity polarized continuum model (SCIPCM).</p>

				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The molecular structures and intramolecular hydrogen bond of Droxidopa have been investigated with density functional theory. It is found that strong hydrogen bonds (O‚ÄìH&#8230;N and O&#8230;H‚ÄìO) exist in the title compound. These hydrogen bonds play essential roles in determining conformational preferences and energy, which would have important effects in biological activity mechanisms that will strongly influence its characteristics in solution. A computational study of a representative number of actual and model structures was carried out in five solvents with different polarities and different types of interactions with solute molecules: water, ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, dimethyl sulfoxide, and tetrahydrofuran, utilizing the polarizable continuum model (PCM) model. The calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. In addition, the topological properties of the electron density distributions for O‚ÄìH&#8230;N(O) intramolecular hydrogen bond were analyzed in terms of the Bader‚Äôs theory of atoms in molecules. Furthermore, the analyses of different hydrogen bonds in this molecule by quantum theory of natural bond orbital (NBO) methods support the density functional theory (DFT) results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A theoretical investigation has been carried out on the mechanism, kinetics, and thermochemistry of gas-phase reaction of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl butyrate (TFEB, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>C(O)OCH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>) with OH radicals using a modern DFT functional. The involvement of pre- and post-reactive complexes was explored and the reaction profiles were modeled. Energetic calculations were performed using the M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) method. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation has been performed to confirm the smooth transition  from the reactant to product through the respective transition state. It has been found that the dominant path of the H-atom abstraction takes place from the ‚ÄìCH<sub>2</sub>- position, which is attached with the methyl group at the one end of TFEB. Theoretically calculated rate constant at 298 K using canonical transition state theory (CTST) is found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Using group-balanced isodesmic procedure, the standard enthalpy of formation for TFEB is reported for the first time. The branching ratios of the different reaction channels are also determined. The atmospheric lifetime of TFEB is determined to be 6.8 days.</p>

				<title>Mathematical description of the nonlinear chemical reactions with oscillatory inflow to the reaction field</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1025-1034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the arduous attempt to find a mathematical solution for the nonlinear autocatalytic chemical processes with a time-varying and oscillating inflow of reactant to the reaction medium has been taken. Approximate analytical solution is proposed. Numerical solutions and analytical attempts to solve the non-linear differential equation indicates a phase shift between the oscillatory influx of intermediate reaction reagent ùëã to the medium of chemical reaction and the change of its concentration in this medium. Analytical solutions indicate that this shift may be associated with the reaction rate constants ùëò<sub>1</sub> and ùëò<sub>2</sub> and the relaxation time ùúè. The relationship between the phase shift and the oscillatory flow of reactant ùëã seems to be similar to that obtained in the case of linear chemical reactions, as described previously, however, the former is much more complex and different. In this paper, we would like to consider whether the effect of forced phase shift in the case of nonlinear and non-oscillatory chemical processes occurring particularly in the living systems have a practical application in laboratory.</p>

Like most of the hydrogen bonded systems, strong correlation between binding energy and stretching frequency of ${\rm H-F}$ and ${\rm O-H}$ stretching mode was observed. The values of electron density and Laplacian of electron density are within the accepted range for hydrogen bonds.

				<abstract>
					<p>The protonation equilibria for the flavonoid naringenin were studied at 25$^{\circ}$C using combined multiwavelength spectroscopic and pH-potentiometric methods as a function of the ionic strength. Over a wide range of ionic strengths, 0.10‚Äì3.00 mol dm$^{‚àí3}$, the investigation was performed in different aqueous solutions of NaClO<sub>4</sub> as the background electrolyte. The dependence on ionic strength of protonation constants was modeled by the Br√∂nsted‚ÄìGuggenheim‚ÄìScatchard Specific Ion Interaction Theory (SIT) and Pitzer approaches. Apart from the values of SIT interaction coefficients and Pitzer parameters, the protonation constants at infinite dilution (zero ionic strength) were obtained. On the basis of these results, it was found that Pitzer mode l gives more satisfactory results rather than the SIT method.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A highly sensitive electrochemical sensor has been constructed for determination of Cr(VI) with the lowest limit of detection (LOD) reported to date using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified screen-printed electrode (SPE). The modification of SPE by casting pure AuNPs increases the sensitivity for detection of Cr(VI) ion using anodic stripping voltammetry. Cr(VI) ions are reduced to chromium metal on SPE-AuNPs by applying deposition potential of ‚Äì1.1 V for 180 s. Afterwards, the oxidation peak current of chromium is obtained by linear sweep voltammetry in the range of ‚àí1.0 V to 0.2 V. Under the optimized conditions (HClO<sub>4</sub>, 0.06 mol L$^{‚àí1}$; deposition potential, ‚Äì1.1 V; deposition time, 180s; scan rate, 0.1 V s$^{‚àí1}$), the limit of detection (LOD) was 1.6 pg mL$^{‚àí1}$.

				<abstract>
					<p>Hofmeister (Specific ion) effects have been considered as important to chemical science as Mendel‚Äôs work was to genetics. In this work, the aggregation kinetics of montmorillonite colloids in H<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, NH$^+_4$, K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> solutions were measured <i>in situ</i>, detecting the unusual kinetics and ion specificity for H<sub>+</sub>. Activation energies that can quantitatively estimate the underlying specific ion effects change in the order of H<sup>+</sup> &#60; Ag<sup>+</sup> &#60; NH$^+_4$ &#60; K<sup>+</sup> &#60; Na<sup>+</sup>. Meanwhile, it was found that although the aggregation of montmorillonite colloids with lower particle densities results in higher activation energies, Hofmeister series will not be affected. It was sufficiently testified that interaction energies of colloidal particles with adsorbed ions show fine correlation with activation energies for colloidal aggregation, and larger interaction energy corresponds to lower activation energy. An attempt was made to quantitatively estimate the ion specificity for H<sup>+</sup>, and it was substantialized that the unusual ion specificity of H<sup>+</sup> is caused by steric effect.</p>

				<title>Simultaneous acquisition of three NMR spectra in a single experiment for rapid resonance assignments in metabolomics</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1091-1097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>NMR-based approach to metabolomics typically involves the collection of two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear correlation spectra for identification and assignment of metabolites. In case of spectral overlap, a 3D spectrum becomes necessary, which is hampered by slow data acquisition for achieving sufficient resolution. We describe here a method to simultaneously acquire three spectra (one 3D and two 2D) in a single data set, which is based on a combination of different fast data acquisition techniques such as G-matrix Fourier transform (GFT) NMR spectroscopy, parallel data acquisition and non-uniform sampling. The following spectra are acquired simultaneously: (1) $^{13}$C multiplicity edited GFT (3,2)D HSQC-TOCSY, (2) 2D [$^1$H-$^1$H] TOCSY and (3) 2D [$^{13}$C-$^1$H] HETCOR. The spectra are obtained at high resolution and provide high-dimensional spectral information for resolving ambiguities. While the GFT spectrum has been shown previously to provide good resolution, the editing of spin systems based on their CH multiplicities further resolves the ambiguities for resonance assignments. The experiment is demonstrated on a mixture of 21 metabolites commonly observed in metabolomics. The spectra were acquired at natural abundance of $^{13}$C. This is the first application of a combination of three fast NMR methods for small molecules and opens up new avenues for high-throughput approaches for NMR-based metabolomics.</p>

				<page>1099-1107</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The results of the computational studies performed on 1,2,4-triazolium cation-based salts designed by pairing it with energetic nitro-substituted 5- membered N-heterocyclic anions such as 5-nitrotetrazolate, 3,5-dinitrotriazolate, and 2,4,5 trinitroimidazolate are reported. Condensed phase heats of formation of the designed ionic salts and their thermodynamic and energetic properties have also been calculated. The results show that these salts are potential energetic materials and possess high positive heats of formation. The detonation velocity, D, and detonation pressure, P, have been calculated using the Kamlet-Jacobs equation and found to be 7‚Äì8 km/s and 25‚Äì29 GPa, respectively. These values fall in the range of the criteria to designate them as high-energy-density materials. Nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) studies performed on the designed molecules show that these salts are stable in nature.</p>

					<p>Effect of external electric fields on the interaction energy between cyclodextrin and alcohol was analyzed in the light of density functional theory (DFT) and density functional reactivity theory (DFRT). Stability of the cyclodextrin-alcohol adducts was measured in terms of DFT based reactivity descriptor, global hardness, electrophilicity, and energy of the HOMO. Stability of adducts was observed to be sensitive towards the strength as well as direction of the applied external electric field. In addition, reactivity pattern follows the maximum hardness and minimum electrophilicity principles.</p>

				<title>Intramolecular hydrogen bond: Can it be part of the basis set of valence internal coordinates in normal mode analysis?</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1127-1134</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been shown earlier<sup>1</sup> that the relaxed force constants (RFCs) could be used as a measure of bond strength only when the bonds form a part of the complete valence internal coordinates (VIC) basis. However, if the bond is not a part of the complete VIC basis, its RFC is not necessarily a measure of bond strength. Sometimes, it is possible to have a complete VIC basis that does not contain the intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB) as part of the basis. This means the RFC of IMHB is not necessarily a measure of bond strength. However, we know that IMHB is a weak bond and hence its RFC has to be a measure of bond strength. We resolve this problem of IMHB not being part of the complete basis by postulating `equivalent‚Äô basis sets where IMHB is part of the basis at least in one of the equivalent sets of VIC. As long as a given IMHB appears in one of the equivalent complete VIC basis sets, its RFC could be used as a measure of bond strength parameter.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thereaction of [Cp<sup>*</sup>M(ùúá-Cl)Cl]<sub>2</sub> (M = Rh, Ir) with 2-aminopyridyl based ligands lead to the formation of mononuclear neutral complexes of general formula [Cp<sup>*</sup>MCl<sub>2</sub>(L)] {where L1= 2-aminopyridine, L2= 2-amino-3-picoline, L3= 2-amino-3-nirtopyridine, and L4= 2-amino-3-pyridine carboxyaldehyde}. The complexes have been characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis, $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR and mass spectroscopic methods. X-ray crystallographic studies of the complexes have shown typical piano-stool geometry around the metal centre in which 2-aminopyridyl ligand acts as an N-monodentate ligand and the amino functionality is not involved in metal coordination. The intra/intermolecular arrangement is due to hydrogen bonding.</p>

				<title>Tuning the structural and catalytic properties of ceria by doping with Zr<sup>4+</sup>, La<sup>3+</sup> and Eu<sup>3+</sup> cations</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1145-1153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work attempts to gain information about the role of trivalent and tetravalent dopants on the structural and catalytic properties of ceria (CeO<sub>2</sub>). In this study, we have prepared Zr<sup>4+</sup>, La<sup>3+</sup>, and Eu<sup>3+</sup> doped ceria (CZ, CL, and CE) by coprecipitation method and calcined at 773 K. The physicochemical characterization was achieved by using various techniques, namely, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The catalytic efficiency for soot oxidation was evaluated by thermogravimetric (TG) method and compared with undoped CeO<sub>2</sub>. Doped CeO<sub>2</sub> catalysts decreased the soot oxidation temperature by more than 158 K compared to pure ceria. This is ascribed to mutual interaction and synergistic effect between the dopant species and the ceria. Among the synthesized nanocatalysts, the CE sample exhibited better performance. The observed better activity of CE was attributed to the presence of more number of oxygen vacancies, a high specific surface area, and easy reducibility as confirmed from Raman, BET surface area, and TPR measurements, respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by simple co-precipitation method and modified with different coating agents such as ascorbic acid, hexanoic acid, salicylic acid, L-arginine and L-cysteine. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by various techniques such as FT IR, XRD, VSM, SEM, TEM and thermal analysis. Both bare and coated magnetites were of cubic spinel structure and spherical in shape. All the magnetite nanoparticles showed superparamagnetic behaviour with high saturated magnetization. <i>In vitro</i> cytotoxicity test of bare and coated nanoparticles was performed using adenocarcinoma cells, A549. Cell viability of bare and L-arginine coated magnetite nanoparticles showed IC<sub>50</sub> value of 31.2 ùúág/mL proving the compatibility of nanocarriers when compared to others. Hence, L-arginine coated nanoparticles were used for loading the drug paclitaxel and the observed IC<sub>50</sub> value (7.8 ùúág/mL) shows its potent anti-proliferative effect against A549 lung cancer cell lines. Thus, it can be speculated that the drug paclitaxel loaded L-arginine coated nanoparticles could be used as an effective drug carrier for the destruction of cancer cells.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The results on synthesis, crystal structure determination and calculation of crystallochemical parameters of YCo<sub>1‚àíùë•</sub>Fe<sub>ùë•</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (ùë• = 0, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67 and 1) perovskites are presented in this work. The compounds within this series were synthesized by solution combustion method using two different fuels: urea and citric acid. It was found that iron-containing perovskites, obtained by citric acid as a fuel are of better quality and crystallinity. All the compounds crystallize in <i>Pnma</i> space group with ùëç = 4. According to the structure and the calculated crystallochemical parameters, the coordination number of Y<sup>3+</sup> in these perovskites is 8. The unit cell parameter relationship is of ùëÇ‚àítype suggesting that the main reason for distortion of ideal perovskite structure is the octahedral tilting. The deformation of the octahedrons, as well as the tilting angles, are increasing with the increasing content of Fe<sup>3+</sup> but the calculated global instability indices (<i>GII</i>) show that the stability of the perovskite structure is increasing with increasing of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> content.</p>

				<title>Facile synthesis of allyl resinate monomer in an aqueous solution under microwave irradiation</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1183-1190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have developed a facile method for production of allyl resinate monomer (allyl rosin ester) via a phase transfer reaction under microwave irradiation. The synthesis of allyl resinate was conducted using allyl chloride and sodium resinate as starting materials in aqueous solution at 50&#176;C for 30 min with a yield of 94.7%, which is 20% higher than conventional heating method. The products precipitated spontaneously from the aqueous phase after reaction, which significantly facilitated the subsequent separation of monomer products. The synthesized monomer product appeared as a viscous liquid, with a viscosity of 460 mPa¬∑s at 25&#176;C and a density of 1.0469 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The physical and chemical properties suggested that the synthesized monomer has great potential for free radical polymerization.</p>

				<title>Synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes by the pyrolysis of a compression activated iron(II) phthalocyanine/phthalocyanine metal-free derivative/ferric acetate mixture</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1191-1199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports on the synthesis of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) from an activated mixture of iron (II) phthalocyanine, its metal-free derivative and ferric acetate. The powdered mixture was activated by compression into a tablet by applying a force of 300 kN, followed by re-grinding into powder and heating it to high temperatures (1000&#176;C). The activation by compression resulted in more than 50% debundling of SWCNTs as judged by transition electron microscopy. Acid functionalization of the SWCNTs was confirmed by the increase in the D:G ratio from 0.56 to 0.87 in the Raman spectra and the observation of an average of one carboxylic acid group per 13 carbon atoms from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA also showed that the initial decomposition temperatures for the activated and non-activated mixtures to be 205&#176;C and 245&#176;C, respectively. Hence, activation leads to the lowering of the pyrolysis temperature of the phthalocyanines. X-ray diffraction, electronic absorption and Fourier transform infrared spectra were also employed to characterize the SWCNT.</p>

				<title>Quantum chemical analysis of potential anti-Parkinson agents</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1211-1220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) are amine oxidoreductase falvoenzymes that belong to the integral proteins of the outer mitochondrial membrane. MAO exists in two distinct isoforms; MAO-A and MAO-B. Inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B is important for developing antidepressant and antiparkinson agents, respectively. In the light of the above explanations, detailed structure binding relationship studies on the intermolecular binding components of MAO-B complexes may unravel the way toward developing novel anti-Parkinson agents. In the present contribution, intermolecular binding pattern for a series of experimentally validated 3-arylcoumarin MAO-B inhibitors (1‚Äì9) have been elucidated via molecular docking and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Intermolecular binding energy components could not be analyzed by docking and due to this limitation, quantum mechanical (QM) calculations including functional B3LYP in association with split valence basis set (Def2-SVP) were applied to estimate the ligand-residue binding energies in the MAO-B active site. Moreover; results were interpreted in terms of calculated polarization effects that were induced by individual amino acids of the MAO-B active site. The results of the present study provide an approach to pharmacophore-based modification within the 3-arylcoumarin scaffold for potent MAO-B inhibitors.</p>

				<page>1243-1251</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The predictive analysis based on quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) on benzim-idazolepyrrolidinyl amides as prolylcarboxypeptidase (PrCP) inhibitors was performed. Molecules were represented by chemical descriptors that encode constitutional, topological, geometrical, and electronic structure features. The hierarchical clustering method was used to classify the dataset into training and test subsets. The important descriptors were selected with the aid of the genetic algorithm method. The QSAR model was constructed, using the multiple linear regressions (MLR), and its robustness and predictability were verified by internal and external cross-validation methods. Furthermore, the calculation of the domain of applicability defines the area of reliable predictions. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the training set and the test set for GA-MLR model were calculated to be 0.176, 0.279 and the correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) were obtained to be 0.839, 0.923, respectively. The proposed model has good stability, robustness and predictability when verified by internal and external validation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole <b>1</b>, an imidazole-based compound, was found to sense Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions via fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy over a number of other metal ions. During Cu<sup>2+</sup> sensing, the chemosensor <b>1</b> followed a ‚Äúswitch-off‚Äù mechanism. Job‚Äôs plot supported 1:1 stoichiometry of <b>1</b>-Cu<sup>2+</sup> complex. The <b>1</b>-Cu<sup>2+</sup> complex formed <i>in situ</i> underwent different absorption changes with OH<sup>‚àí</sup> ions. These differential absorption changes observed with the addition of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and OH<sup>‚àí</sup> ions were used to mimic AND logic gate using A<sub>274nm</sub> as output.</p>

X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compounds <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> possess similar 2 D double-layered structures with (3,4)-connected (6<sup>3</sup>)(6<sup>5</sup>¬∑8) topology, while compound <b>3</b> displays a 2 D layer with {6<sup>2</sup>.10}{6} topology. The adjacent layers of <b>1</b>‚Äì<b>3</b> are finally extended into 3 D supramolecular frameworks by hydrogen bonding interactions.

				<title>Kinetic measurements and quantum chemical calculations on low spin Ni(II)/(III) macrocyclic complexes in aqueous and sulphato medium</title>

					<p>Cu(II) ion catalyzed kinetics of oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by [Ni<sup>III</sup>L<sub>2</sub>] (L<sub>2</sub> = 1,8-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,3,6,8,10,13-hexaazacyclotetradecane) was studied in aqueous acidic medium in the presence of sulphate ion. The rate of oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by [Ni<sup>III</sup>L<sub>2</sub>] is faster than that by [Ni<sup>III</sup>L<sub>1</sub>] (L<sub>1</sub> = 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclote-tradecane) in sulphate medium. DFT calculations at BP86/def2-TZVP level lead to different modes of bonding between [NiL]<sup>II/III</sup> and water ligands (L = L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>). In aqueous medium, two water molecules interact with [NiL]<sup>II</sup> through weak hydrogen bonds with L and are tilted by $\sim$23&#176; from the vertical axis forming the dihydrate [NiL]<sup>2+</sup>.2H<sub>2</sub>O. However, there is coordinate bond formation between [NiL<sub>1</sub>]<sup>III</sup> and two water molecules in aqueous medium and an aqua and a sulphato ligand in sulphate medium leading to the octahedral complexes [NiL<sub>1</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> and [NiL<sub>1</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>+</sup>. In the analogous [NiL<sub>2</sub>]<sup>III</sup>, the water molecules are bound by hydrogen bonds resulting in [NiL<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>.2H<sub>2</sub>O and [NiL<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)]<sup>+</sup>.H<sub>2</sub>O. As the sulphato complex [NiL<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)]<sup>+</sup>.H<sub>2</sub>O is less stable than [NiL<sub>1</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>+</sup> in view of the weak H-bonding interactions in the former it can react faster. Thus the difference in the mode of bonding between Ni(III) and the water ligand can explain the rate of oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by [Ni<sup>III</sup>L] complexes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, density functional theory and <i>ab initio</i> molecular orbital calculations were used to investigate the hydrogen bonded complexes of type RCHO¬∑¬∑¬∑HOR&#8242;(R = H, CN, CF<sub>3</sub>, OCH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub>; R&#8242; = H, Cl, CH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub>, C(O)H, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) employing 6-31++g<sup>**</sup> and cc-pVTZ basis sets. Thus, the present work considers how the substituents at both the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor affect the hydrogen bond strength. From the analysis, it is reflected that presence of ‚ÄìOCH<sub>3</sub> and ‚ÄìNH<sub>2</sub> substituents at RCHO greatly strengthen the stabilization energies, while ‚ÄìCN and ‚ÄìCF<sub>3</sub> decrease the same with respect to HCHO as hydrogen bond acceptor. The highest stabilization results in case of (H<sub>2</sub>N)CHO as hydrogen bond acceptor. The variation of the substituents at ‚ÄìOH functional group also influences the strength of hydrogen bond; nearly all the substituents increase the stabilization energy relative to HOH. The analysis of geometrical parameters; proton affinities, charge transfer, electron delocalization studies have been carried out.</p>

				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1321-1328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An environmentally friendly protocol is described for an economic, practical laboratory-scale oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, using a bis-chloro-bridged binuclear Cu(II) complex [(HL)Cu(ùúá<sub>2</sub>-Cl)<sub>2</sub>Cu(HL)]*1.5 CH<sub>3</sub>OH as catalyst. The catalyst was prepared in situ from commercially available reagents and is characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis, FT-IR, UV-visible spectra, mass spectrometry, and powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD). The geometry of the complex has been optimized using the B3LYP level of theory confirming the experimental data. Our results demonstrated well the efficiency, selectivity and stability of this new catalyst in the oxidation of alcohols in ethanol and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) as a green solvent and oxidant, respectively. Turnover number and reusability have proven the high efficiency and relative stability of the catalyst.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The reaction of [Ru(ùúÇ<sup>6</sup>-cymene)Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub> and PPh<sub>2</sub>Cl in the ratio 1:2 gives a stable [Ru(ùúÇ<sup>6</sup>-cymene) Cl<sub>2</sub>(PPh<sub>2</sub>Cl)] complex. Attempts to make the cationic [Ru(ùúÇ<sup>6</sup>-cymene)Cl(PPh<sub>2</sub>Cl)<sub>2</sub>]Cl with excess PPh<sub>2</sub>Cl and higher temperatures led to adventitious hydrolysis and formation of [Ru(ùúÇ<sup>6</sup>-cymene)Cl<sub>2</sub> (PPh<sub>2</sub>OH)]. Attempts to make a phosphinite complex by reacting [Ru(ùúÇ<sup>6</sup>-cymene)Cl<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub> with PPh<sub>2</sub>Cl in the presence of an alcohol results in the reduction of PPh<sub>2</sub>Cl to give [Ru(ùúÇ<sup>6</sup>-cymene)Cl<sub>2</sub>(PPh<sub>2</sub>H)] and the expected phosphinite. The yield of the hydride complex is highest when the alcohol is 1-phenyl-ethane-1,2-diol. All three half-sandwich complexes are characterized by X-ray crystallography. Surprisingly, the conversion of chlorodiphenylphosphine to diphenylphosphine is mediated by 1-phenyl-ethane-1,2-diol even in the absence of the ruthenium half-sandwich precursor.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, nanosized Ce<sub>0.7</sub>M<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>2‚àíùõø</sub> (M = Mn, Fe, Co) solid solutions were prepared by a facile coprecipitation method and evaluated for CO oxidation. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized samples were investigated by various characterization techniques, namely, XRD, ICP-OES, BET surface area, SEM-EDX, TEM and HRTEM, Raman, XPS, and H<sub>2</sub> -TPR. XRD studies confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline single phase Ce<sub>0.7</sub>M<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>2‚àíùõø</sub>  solid solutions. ICP-OES analysis confirmed actual amount of metal loadings in the respective catalysts. The BET surface area of Ce<sub>0.7</sub>M<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>2‚àíùõø</sub> samples significantly enhanced after the incorporation of dopants. TEM studies confirmed nanosized nature of the samples and the average particle sizes of Ce<sub>0.7</sub>M<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>2‚àíùõø</sub> were found to be in the range of ~8‚Äì16 nm. Raman studies indicated that the incorporation of dopant ions into the CeO<sub>2</sub> lattice promote the formation of more oxygen vacancies. The existence of oxygen vacancies and different oxidation states (Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>3+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>/ Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>3+</sup>) in the doped CeO<sub>2</sub> samples were further confirmed from XPS investigation. TPR measurements revealed an enhanced reducibility of ceria after the incorporation of dopants. The catalytic activity results indicated that the doped CeO<sub>2</sub> samples show excellent CO oxidation activity and the order of activity was found to be Ce<sub>0.7</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>2‚àíùõø</sub> &#62; Ce<sub>0.7</sub>Fe<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>2‚àíùõø</sub> &#62; Ce<sub>0.7</sub>Co<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>2‚àíùõø</sub> &#62; CeO<sub>2</sub>. The superior CO oxidation performance of CeO<sub>2</sub>-MnO<sub>x</sub> has been attributed to a unique Ce-Mn synergistic interaction, which facilitates materials with promoted redox properties and improved oxidation activity.</p>

				<page>1361-1367</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel thiourea-based non-ionic surfactant 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-dodecanoylthiourea (4CPDT) was synthesized from decanoyl chloride, potassium thiocyanate and 4-chloroanline in high yield. The structural chemistry of the compound was done by multiple nuclear NMR (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13 </sup>C) and FT-IR. UV-Visible spectrophotometry and pendant drop methods were used to evaluate their critical micelle concentration in ethanol and hexane. This surfactant showed very low solubility in water, and interestingly low but well-defined, sub-millimolar critical micelle concentration (CMC) in ethanol and hexane, demonstrating that this is moderately amphiphobic. Its low value of critical micelle concentration indicates economical use for cleaning purposes and environment-friendly applications. It was also characterized by cyclic and square wave voltammetry and found to be electrochemically active giving sharp signal in different pH media.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Click reaction of alkynylthiacalix[4]arene with ethyl 2-azidoacetate, followed by ammonolysis with hydrazine hydrate and Schiff-base condensation with benzaldehyde or salicyic aldehyde, afforded two novel thiacalix[4]arene derivatives containing multiple aromatic groups in yields of 86% and 90%. Their complexation properties for four organic dyes were investigated by liquid-liquid extraction experiments, complexation UV-Vis spectra and mass spectrum. The highest extraction percentage was 97% for Neutral red. The UV- Vis spectra and ESI-MS spectrum indicated the 1:1 complexes in DMSO solution. The association constants were as high as 1‚àº 8 &#215; 10<sup>4 </sup> M<sup>‚àí1</sup>. These complexation experiments showed that thiacalix[4]arene receptors possess excellent complexation capabilities for dyes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we reveal that the intrinsic low electronic conductivity of the pristine LiVPO<sub>4</sub>F is overcome with conductive Cu-coating. The existence of nano-Cu is confirmed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The morphology and particle size are observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Galvanostatic charge/discharge test indicates that Cu coating is effective to improve the discharge capacity, cycle performance and rate capability. Analysis of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) shows that the addition of nano-Cu markedly decreases the charge transfer resistance of the pristine LiVPO<sub>4</sub>F electrode.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new hybrid salt (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub>N<sub>2</sub>)[Cr(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>].3H<sub>2</sub>O, 3,5-dimethylpyrazole Cis diaquadioxala-tochromate(III) trihydrate, has been prepared by slow evaporation at room temperature and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, IR, UV‚Äìvisible spectroscopies, PXRD and thermogravimetric analyses. Furthermore, the observed crystal morphology was compared to the simulated one using the Bravais-Friedel, Donnay-Harker model. The structure of the title compound consists of [Cr(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) <sub>2</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>O) <sub>2</sub>]<sup>‚àí</sup> mononuclear anions, 3,5-dimethylpyrazole cations and three uncoordinated water molecules. The Cr<sup>3+</sup> ion is six coordinated in a slightly distorted octahedral environment, by two O atoms from two water molecules and four O atoms of two oxalate anions acting as chelating ligands. The cohesion of the structure is established by intermolecular O‚ÄìH...O, N‚ÄìH...O hydrogen bonds which connect ionic entities and water molecules and also by ùúã‚Äìùúã stacking interactions between the rings of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole cations. Hence, both coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules play an important role in the hydrogen-bonding system and stabilize the structure.</p>

				<title>Structural and vibrational spectral studies on hydrogen bonded salts: 4-chloroanilinium maleate and nitrate</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>1435-1450</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, proton transfer from nitric and maleic acids to amine group (4-chloroaniline) led to hydrogen bonded crystals of 4-chloroanilinium maleate (4CAM) and 4-chloroanilinium nitrate (4CAN) which are investigated by the experimental and theoretical approaches. The molecular structures of these two compounds were optimized with the Density Functional Theory (DFT) using B3LYP function and the Hartree-Fock (HF) level with a6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Geometrical parameters of the molecules were also analyzed along with their intermolecular hydrogen bond, which tailors the ions. These analyses show that present molecules are stabilized through the N‚ÄìH¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ O and O‚ÄìH¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ O hydrogen bonds. The vibrational modes were computed by quantum chemical methods. Further, these modes are investigated by FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopy in the range of 4000‚Äì400 cm<sup>‚àí1</sup>. The optimized molecular geometry and computed vibrational spectra are compared with experimental results, which show significant agreement. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was carried out to interpret hyperconjucative interaction and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). This analysis gives the precise insight into the nature of H-bond interactions. The chemical hardness, electronegativity and chemical potential of the molecules were determined by HOMO‚ÄìLUMO plot. The frontier molecular orbitals have small band gap value, which signify the possible biological/pharmaceutical activity of the compounds.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Electrophilic allylation of phenolic substrates including salicylaldehydes with (ùõº-hydroxy) allylphosphonates is presented. It is observed that catalytic FeCl<sub>3</sub> is sufficient to accomplish the allylation. Interestingly, the reaction led to the formation of <i>allylphosphonates</i> in addition to <i>vinylphosphonates</i>, depending upon the substituent. The vinylphosphonates obtained here are ùê∏-isomers. More importantly, the reaction occurred regioselectively with respect to the phenolic substrates. Substituted allylphosphonates are formed when salicylaldehyde or (2-hydroxy-phenyl)arylmethanones are used. Conclusive proof for the formation of allylphosphontates as well as vinylphosphonates has been provided by single crystal X-ray crystallography.</p>

					<p>In this report we present results of theoretical analysis for the reaction mechanism involving a tungsten-germylyne complex with ùõº, ùõΩ-unsaturated ketones. Three different substituents, namely H, Me and CF<sub>3</sub> in ùõº-position of the unsaturated ketones have been selected to account for a variety of experimental observations.

				<abstract>
					<p>A general scheme for the oxidation of benzyl alcohols catalyzed by silica functionalized copper (II) has been designed. TEMPO, a free radical, assists this oxidation that was initiated by molecular oxygen which converts it to a primary oxidant. This catalytic combination i.e. SiO<sub>2</sub> -Cu(II) in presence of TEMPO and oxygen provides excellent results in terms of yields and reaction time. SiO<sub>2</sub> -Cu(II) was very well characterized by different spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, XRD, TGA, XPS, EDAX, SEM, TEM and AAS and is recyclable upto five times which makes it economically beneficial.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The molecular and crystal structure of the adduct NF<sub>3</sub>¬∑BF<sub>3</sub> was studied computationally using density functional theory. It shows that the adduct exists in the form of a complex but is not ionic. The heats of formation in the gas and the condensed phase of the adduct are ‚àí1266.09 and ‚àí1276.37 kJ¬∑mol<sup>‚àí1</sup>, respectively, which indicates that it is stable under atmospheric conditions. The crystal form belongs to ùëÉ2<sub>1</sub>/ùëê space group. The calculated large band gap (ùõ• ùê∏<sub>g</sub>) of the crystal proves that it is stable.

				<page>1497-1504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations of H+HBr $\rightarrow$ H<sub>2</sub> + Br reaction have been performed on a recently proposed <i>ab initio</i> potential energy surface. The reaction probability and integral cross section are found to be in fairly good agreement with the available quantum mechanical (QM) results on this surface. The behavior of reactivity is well consistent with properties of exothermic reaction. Once the energy of vibrational excited HBr is larger than the barrier height, the integral cross sections for the reaction diverge at very low collision energies close to the threshold, similarly to capture reaction. In addition, differential cross sections show that scattering of the product H<sub>2</sub> shift from backward to forward directions as the collision energy and vibrational quantum number increase. All the theoretical findings are reasonably explained by the properties of the surface, as well as reactive mechanisms.</p>

					<p>The competition between the two electron donors (‚ÄìOCH<sub>3</sub> and ‚ÄìOSiH<sub>3</sub>) have been studied by positioning them at <i>geminal and vicinal</i> locations. We have also studied the <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> geometrical isomerism at the <i>vicinal</i> location. Thermodynamic and activation parameters such as free energies have been computed to understand the potential energy surface of the reaction. Our computed activation hardness supports the proposed torquoselectivity. Further, Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) was calculated at the ring centre of the transition state (TS) which additionally supports the torquoselectivity. The delicate preferences for the pathways have been substantiated through NBO interactions.</p>

				<title>Heavy main-group iodometallates hybridized by alkali metal via 1,10-Phenanthroline-5,6-dione</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1531-1538</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Alkali metals were introduced into heavy main-group iodometallates to get two new IA/IVAheterometallic frameworks [PbI<sub>3</sub>K(pdon)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>ùëõ</sub> (<b>1</b>) and {[Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>9</sub>K<sub>2</sub>(pdon)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>3</sub>O)]¬∑H<sub>2</sub>O}<sub> ùëõ</sub> (<b>2</b>) (pdon=1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione), which were obtained as single phases by hydrothermal method at different pH values. Compounds <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are three-dimensional heterometallic frameworks constructed from the linkage of pdon ligand between iodometallate chains and potassium oxides/iodide clusters. Specially, these two heterometallic frameworks exhibit broadened absorption bands at 700 and 750 nm compared with those of bulk PbI<sub>2</sub> and pdon ligand. The band gap of <b>2</b> is wider than that of <b>1</b>, which is due to the absence of ùúã ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ùúã interaction in <b>2</b>. Their thermal stabilities are also discussed.</p>

					<p>Synthesis of three Br√∏nsted acid-based ionic liquids, namely, 1-ethyl-1,2,4-triazolium triflate (1a), 1-propyl-1,2,4-triazolium triflate (1b) and 1-butyl-1,2,4-triazolium triflate (1c), is described. These ionic liquids have been employed as catalysts for convenient and high-yielding one-pot synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones and 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-thiones, which are Biginelli reaction products. Advantages of the methodology are operational convenience, short reaction times, avoidance of chromatographic purification and non-production of toxic waste.

				<title>Molecular structure investigation and tautomerism aspects of (ùê∏)-3-benzylideneindolin-2-one</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis and spectral characterization of the (ùê∏)-3-benzylideneindolin-2-one is reported. The compound crystallized in the monoclinic system with space group P 2<sub>1</sub>/ùëõ with cell coordinates ùëé = 3.9849 (2) √Ö, ùëè = 22.2236 (9) √Ö, ùëê = 12.2501 (5) √Ö, ùõΩ = 95.0535 (12)&#176; , ùëâ =1080.64 (8) √Ö 3 , and ùëç = 4. In the crystal, molecules are packed in chains formed via weak intermolecular C13‚ÄìH13A¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ O1 and N1-H1N1. . .O1 hydrogen bonding. The relative stabilities of the two tautomeric isomers of <b>3</b> are calculated by DFT/B3LYP method using 6-311G(d,p) basis set in gas phase and in solution. The quantum chemical calculations, NMR studies and the XRD analyses showed that the keto form T0 is the only form that could exist in gas, solution and solid phases respectively. The calculated geometric parameters of the dimer molecule showed better agreement with the XRD data than those obtained for single isolated molecule. This shed light on the effect of intermolecular interactions on the calculated geometric parameters. MEP study showed that, the O-atom and the NH proton are the most reactive H-acceptor and H-donor sites, respectively. The N-H...O H-bonding interactions increased the negative charge at the O-atoms and the positive charge of the NH protons compared to the monomer unit.</p>

				<title>Synthetic strategy for bicyclic tetrapeptides HDAC inhibitors using ring closing metathesis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1563-1569</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cyclic peptides show diverse biological activities and are considered as good therapeutic agents due to structural rigidity, receptor selectivity and biochemical stability. We have developed bicyclic tetrapeptide HDAC inhibitors based on different cyclic tetrapeptide scaffolds. For the synthesis of these bicyclic tetrapeptides, two cyclization steps, namely, peptide cyclization and fusion of aliphatic side chains by ring closing metathesis (RCM) were involved. In the course of these syntheses, we have established two facts: a lower limit of aliphatic loop length and better synthetic route for bicyclic tetrapeptide synthesis. It was found that nine methylene loop length is the lower limit for aliphatic loop and the synthetic route selection depended on the configuration of amino acids in the cyclic tetrapeptide scaffold. RCM followed by peptide cyclization was the proper route for LDLD configuration and the reverse route was suitable for LLLD configuration.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A series of novel dipolar and nonplanar compounds featuring electron acceptor benzo[ùëî]quinoxaline and various electron donor triarylamine units have been synthesized in good yields and fully characterized. The photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties of the synthesized compounds are described. The photoluminescence properties of the synthesized molecules are influenced by peripheral amines. The derivatives have high Stokes shifts, low band gap and the Commission Internationale de l‚ÄôEclairage (CIE) coordinates are positioned in the green‚Äìyellow region of the chromaticity diagram. The ionization potentials and electron affinity were found to be in the range of 5.11‚Äì5.60 eV and 2.77‚Äì2.93 eV and are comparable to the commonly used hole transporters. Thermal studies also reveal that these synthesized molecules have good thermal stability with 5% and 10% weight loss temperature ranging from 200 to 355&#176;C and 268 to 442&#176;C, respectively.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>1607-1617</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new label-free electrochemical DNA biosensor is presented based on carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified with gold (Au) and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles to prepare the bimetallic nanocomposite electrode. The proposed sensor was made by immobilization of 15-mer single stranded oligonucleotide probe related to p53 gene for detection of DNA plasmid samples. The hybridization detection relied on the alternation in the guanine oxidation signal following hybridization of the probe with complementary genomic DNA.The technique of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used for monitoring guanine oxidation. To optimize the performance of the modified CPE, different electrodes were prepared in various percentages of Au and Pt nanoparticles. The modified electrode containing 15% Au/Pt bimetallic nanoparticles (15% Au/Pt-MCPE) was selected as the best working electrode. The selectivity of the sensor was investigated using plasmid samples containing non-complementary oligonucleotides. The detection limit of the biosensor was studied and calculated to be 53.10 pg ùúáL<sup>‚àí1</sup>.</p>

				<title>Access to new antimicrobial 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1619-1626</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis of some novel coumarin esters has been accomplished through iodine-catalyzed method using 4-methylumbelliferone as the starting material. Condensation of hydrazide, which was obtained in two steps from 4-methylumbelliferone, with some arylaldhydes provided hydrazone derivatives, while the reaction with phenylthioisocyanate leads to the thiosemicarbazide that evolved into two new compounds. Finally, condensation reaction of hydrazide with three diketones afforded new pyrrole and pyrazole derivatives. Structures of all synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectroscopic methods including <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR and ES-HRMS. They were finally tested for their antimicrobial activity and the structure-activity relationship was discussed.</p>

				<title>Differential scanning calorimetric and powder X-ray diffraction studies on a homologous series of ùëÅ-acyl-L-alanine esters with matched chains (ùëõ = 9-18)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1627-1635</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A homologous series of two chain derivatives of L-alanine, namely ùëÅ-acyl L-alanine alkyl esters (NAAEs), bearing matched, saturated, acyl and alkyl chains (ùëõ = 9-18) have been synthesized. The thermotropic phase transitions and supramolecular structure of NAAEs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Results obtained from DSC studies indicate that the transition temperatures (ùëá<sub>t</sub>), enthalpies (ùõ• ùêª<sub>t</sub>) and entropies (ùõ• ùëÜ<sub>t</sub>) exhibit odd-even alternation with compounds bearing odd acyl and alkyl chains showing higher values of ùëá<sub>t</sub>, ùõ• ùêª<sub>t</sub> and ùõ• ùëÜ<sub>t</sub> as compared to NAAEs with even acyl and alkyl chains. However, the transition enthalpies and entropies of the odd- and even chain length series independently exhibit a linear dependence on the chain length. The ùëë-spacings obtained from PXRD increase linearly with chain length with an increment of 1.76 √Ö/CH<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that NAAEs adopt either a tilted bilayer structure or a bent structure. The present results provide a thermodynamic and structural basis for investigating the interaction of NAAEs with other membrane lipids, which in turn can shed light in understanding how they can enhance the transdermal permeability of stratum corneum.</p>

				<title>Syntheses and structural characterization of new dithiophosphinato cadmium complexes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1653-1663</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New cadmium complexes of 4-methoxyphenyl dithiophosphinic acids, H<sub>3</sub>CO-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-(R)PS<sub>2</sub>H were prepared. The five dithiophosphinato ligands (L) involved were of the general structure H<sub>3</sub>CO-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-(R)PS<sub>2</sub>‚àíwith R= 3-methylbutyl, (L1); n-butyl, (L2); 2-methylpropyl, (L3); 1-methylpropyl, (L4) and 2-propyl, (L5).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the preparation and characterization of the n-butyl-derivative. The acid forms of the ligands were obtained by treatment of the Lawesson reagent, (LR) [2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4-disulfide] with the corresponding Grignard reagent in dry diethylether. The acids formed were transformed into easily crystallizable ammonium salts (NH<sub>4</sub>L) for purification. These salts were treated with CdCl<sub>2</sub> in ethanol at room temperature to produce the bis-dithiophosphinato cadmium complexes ([Cd(L)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>) exclusively. The structures of the complexes were elucidated by elemental analysis, MS, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy techniques as well as <sup>1</sup>H-, <sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>31</sup>P- NMR. The crystal structures of [Cd(L1)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub> and [Cd(L2)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub> were also studied as examples. X-ray studies confirmed the nonplanar, four-coordination geometry of the complexes and indicate that electron delocalization prevails in the PS$_{‚àí}^{2}$ moiety of the dithiophosphinato groups.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the structurally similar multinuclear cobaloxime complexes based on dioxime ligands were synthesized and characterized as trinuclear complexes with respect to varied axial groups. The multinuclear cobaloxime complexes were characterized by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, FT-IR, UV-Vis, LC-MS spectra, melting point and magnetic susceptibility measurements. These multinuclear cobaloxime complexes have been successfully applied to the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO<sub>2</sub> and epoxides under optimized conditions and with-out using any solvent. All multinuclear cobaloxime complexes obtained by click chemistry are good catalysts for the cycloaddition of CO<sub>2</sub> to different epoxides in the presence of pyridine as a co-catalyst. Additionally, the effects of epoxides, bases, temperature, pressure, and time on the yield of cyclic carbonates were investigated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The structures and properties of pentaflourophenyl xenonium diflouride cation (PFF) have been studied in their salts with 12 different counter ions using DFT calculations. The results demonstrated the huge effect of counter ion on all properties. The hybridization values, obtained from the NBO calculations, showed that xenon mostly used pure p orbital in their bonds, especially in Xe-F bond. Calculated binding energies (ùõ•H<sub>b</sub>) and (ùõ•G<sub>b</sub>) indicated that the best anions for PFF are OH<sup>-</sup>, F<sup>-</sup>, BH<sup>-</sup><sub>4</sub> and OAc<sup>-</sup>. Moreover, the variations of HOMO and LUMO energies and the reactivity parameters have been investigated for all structures. The results of QTAIM calculations confirmed the covalent nature of Xe-C bond and the electrostatic nature of other xenon bonds. Finally, IR frequencies, NMR chemical shifts and NMR coupling constants were calculated to examine the effect of counter ion on the spectral properties of studied structures.</p>

				<title>Modelling Gas Adsorption in Porous Solids: Roles of Surface Chemistry and Pore Architecture</title>

				<page>1687-1699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Modelling the adsorption of small molecule gases such as N<sub>2</sub> , CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in porous solids can provide valuable insights for the development of next generation materials. Employing a grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation code developed in our group, the adsorption isotherms of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in many metal organic frameworks have been calculated and compared with experimental results. The isotherms computed within a force field approach are able to well reproduce the experimental data. Key functional groups in the solids which interact with gas molecules and the nature of their interactions have been identified. The most favorable interaction sites for CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in the framework solids are located in the linkers which are directed towards the pores. The structure of a perfluorinated conjugated microporous polymer has been modelled and it is predicted to take up 10% more CO<sub>2</sub> than its hydrogenated counterpart. In addition, the vibrational, orientational and diffusive properties of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbed in the solids have been examined using molecular dynamics simulations. Intermolecular modes of such adsorbed species exhibit a blue shift with increasing gas pressure.</p>

				<title>Atomistic details of the molecular recognition of DNA-RNA hybrid duplex by ribonuclease H enzyme</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1701-1713</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Bacillus halodurans</i> (ùêµ‚Ñé) ribonuclease H (RNase H) belongs to the nucleotidyl-transferase (NT) superfamily and is a prototypical member of a large family of enzymes that use two-metal ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>) catalysis to cleave nucleic acids. Long timescale molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on the ùêµ‚ÑéRNase H-DNA-RNA hybrid complex and the respective monomers to understand the recognition mechanism, conformational preorganization, active site dynamics and energetics involved in the complex formation. Several structural and energetic analyses were performed and significant structural changes are observed in enzyme and hybrid duplex during complex formation. Hybrid molecule binding to RNase H enzyme leads to conformational changes in the DNA strand. The ability of the DNA strand in the hybrid duplex to sample conformations corresponding to typical A- and B-type nucleic acids and the characteristic minor groove width-seem to be crucial for efficient binding. Sugar moieties in certain positions interacting with the protein structure undergo notable conformational transitions. The water coordination and arrangement around the metal ions in active site region are quite stable, suggesting their important role in enzymatic catalysis. Details of key interactions found at the interface of enzyme-nucleic acid complex that are responsible for its stability are discussed.</p>

				<title>Use of polydispersity index as control parameter to study melting/freezing of Lennard-Jones system: Comparison among predictions of bifurcation theory with Lindemann criterion, inherent structure analysis and Hansen-Verlet rule</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1715-1728</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using polydispersity index as an additional order parameter we investigate freezing/melting transition of Lennard-Jones polydisperse systems (with Gaussian polydispersity in size), especially to gain insight into the origin of the terminal polydispersity. The average inherent structure (IS) energy and root mean square displacement (RMSD) of the solid before melting both exhibit quite similar polydispersity dependence including a discontinuity at solid-liquid transition point. Lindemann ratio, obtained from RMSD, is found to be dependent on temperature. At a given number density, there exists a value of polydispersity index (ùõø<sub>P</sub>) above which no crystalline solid is stable. <i>This transition value of polydispersity (termed as transition polydispersity, ùõø<sub>P</sub>) is found to depend strongly on temperature, a feature missed in hard sphere model systems.</i> Additionally, for a particular temperature when number density is increased, ùõø<sub>P</sub> shifts to higher values. This temperature and number density dependent value of ùõø<sub>P</sub> saturates surprisingly to a value which is found to be nearly the same for all temperatures, known as terminal polydispersity (ùõø<sub>TP</sub>). This value (ùõø<sub>TP</sub> ‚àº 0.11) is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 0.12, but differs from hard sphere transition where this limiting value is only 0.048. Terminal polydispersity (ùõø<sub>TP</sub>) thus has a quasiuniversal character. Interestingly, the bifurcation diagram obtained from non-linear integral equation theories of freezing seems to provide an explanation of the existence of unique terminal polydispersity in polydisperse systems. Global bond orientational order parameter is calculated to obtain further insights into mechanism for melting.</p>

				<title>Theoretical exploration of pnicogen bond noncovalent interactions in HCHO¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ PH<sub>2</sub>X (X=CH<sub>3</sub>, H, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, F, Cl, Br, and NO<sub>2</sub>) complexes</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Pnicogen bond (ZB) is a new kind of intermolecular weak interaction, which would be an important strategy for the construction of supramolecular materials. In this paper, ab initio MP2/aug-cc-pvDZ calculations have been carried out to characterize the X-P &#8943; O ZB interactions between HCHO and PH<sub>2</sub>X (X=CH<sub>3</sub>, H, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, F, Cl, Br, and NO<sub>2</sub>). The calculated interaction energies with basis set super-position error (BSSE) corrections in seven ZB complexes are between ‚àí7.51 and ‚àí20.36 kJ¬∑mol<sup>‚àí1</sup>. The relative stabilities of the seven complexes increase in the order: HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> &#60; HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>3</sub> &#60; HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> &#60; HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub> Br &#60; HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub> Cl &#60; HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub>F &#60; HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. The natural bond orbital (NBO) and natural resonance theory (NRT) analysis were employed to investigate the electron behavior and nature of the ZBs. The natural bond orbital interactions in the ZBs are mainly LP<sup>1,2</sup>  (O) &#8594; ùúé* (P-X). The P-X (X= Br, Cl, F and NO<sub>2</sub>) are more suitable for acting as ZB donors than the P-X (X=H, CH<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) groups. The electron density topology properties based on atoms-inmolecules (AIM) theory showed that the ZB interactions in the HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub>X (X=Br, Cl, F and NO<sub>2</sub>) are stronger than those of HCHO&#8943; PH<sub>2</sub> X(X=CH<sub>3</sub> , H and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) complexes, indicating that the electron withdrawing of X benefits for the stability of ZB structure.</p>

The two complexes were characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic tools, and by X-ray crystal structures of both ligands and the complex <b>1</b>. In complex <b>1</b>, zinc(II) is chelated by three ligands with a distorted octahedral geometry. The DNA-binding properties of zinc complexes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> have been investigated by spectroscopic methods and viscosity measurements. The results suggest that both complexes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> bind to DNA in an intercalation mode between the uncoordinated furan or thiophene chromophore and the base pairs of DNA.</p>

				<title>A computational investigation of the photochemical oxaziridine and amide conversion process of open-chain conjugated nitrone with electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group on nitrogen</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1757-1768</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This computational study investigates the photo-excitation process and subsequent photoproduct formation steps through non-radiative deactivation channels in open-chain conjugated N-substituted nitrone systems (model compounds of corresponding retinylnitrones) having electron-withdrawing groups on nitrogen. Calculations mostly based on CASSCF/6-31G* and CASMP2/6-31G* level of theories on a representative system with N-trifluoromethyl substituent have predicted initial photo-excitation to a planar singlet state. This photochemical path is subsequently followed by a barrierless non-radiative channel towards the lowest-energy conical intersection (CI) geometry having a terminal CNO kink, and situated at 30 kcal/mol below the planar excited state. Following the direction of its gradient difference (GD) vectors, an oxaziridine-type species (R<sub>C‚àíO</sub> = 1.38 √Ö, R<sub>N‚àíO</sub> = 1.53 √Ö, &#60; CNO= 55.8&#176;) appears at 3‚Äì6 kcal mol<sup>‚àí1</sup> below the ground state nitrone system through a transition state (along its reverse direction of minimum-energy path), situated on the reaction pathway. This species with an elongated N-O bond seems to be heading towards an amide geometry. On the other hand, in the opposite GD vector direction a proper oxaziridine geometry has been obtained with a much shorter N-O bond distance (R<sub>N‚àíO</sub> = 1.42 √Ö).</p>

				<feature />
				<page>1777-1784</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Periodic density functional theory with dispersion correction (DFT-D) was used to study the structural, electronic, and absorption properties of crystalline 5-nitramino-3, 4-dinitropyrazole (NADNP) under hydrostatic compression of 0-140 GPa. The results indicate that the PBE-G06 is the best functional for studying NADNP. As the pressure increases, the lattice of parameters, band gap, density of states and absorption spectra change regularly except for 126 GPa, where NADNP begins to decompose and form a new bond. An analysis of the band gap and density of states indicates that NADNP becomes more and more sensitive under compression. The absorption spectra show that NADNP has relatively high optical activity with increasing pressure.</p>

					<p>This investigation was set to provide derivatives of thiazolidin-4-ones incorporated with amino-alkyl naphthols in a molecular frame work. For this purpose, a series of 1-thiocarbamidoalkyl-2-naphthols was prepared by the three component condensation of aromatic aldehydes, phenylthiourea and 2-naphthol. In the next step, these compounds underwent reaction with dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates at ambient temperature in ethanol to afford the corresponding 4-thiazolidinones in high yields. Following the completion of the reaction, the products were solidified and isolated by filtration. The method is easy, inexpensive, chemoselective and environmentally benign and illustrates an interesting instance of click chemistry.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A number of dendrons of various chain lengths derived from the esters of 3,4,5-tris(tetrade-cyloxy)benzoic acid were synthesized. These esters were used as building blocks in the design of polyester molecules. Intermediate products, such as branched compounds with variation of functional groups in focal point (aromatic acids and their benzyl esters, aldehydes of different generation) were obtained. The structure and purity of all the compounds were determined by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF). The phase behavior was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and confirmed by polarized optical microscopy. Consequently, it was established that the liquid-crystalline properties of this series of dendrons arise from the degree of branching. This behavior can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bonds, as well as microsegregation processes of the links of the macromolecule.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Several microbial transformations of steroids to 17-keto cortisones through side chain cleavage have been presented in the literature; however, yields and product selectivity in these methods were low. In the present study, some new methods have been identified for the side chain cleavage of prednisolone (<b>1</b>) to form 11-ùõΩ-hydroxy-1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione (11-ùõΩ-hydroxy ADD). Prednisolone upon reaction with zinc chloride in dry THF results in the formation of cleavage product in good yield (76%). 11-ùõΩ-hydroxy ADD (<b>2</b>) has been formed in moderate yield (60%) under the Reformatsky reaction conditions by reacting with zincate. While performing the Wittig reaction using stable ylides, again results in the formation of compound <b>2</b> in good yield (56%). Side chain cleavage of prednisolone was confirmed from the physical and analytical data and similar when compared with the literature reports.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two series of bent shaped 1,3,4-oxadiazole/thiadiazole heterocyclic ring containing liquid crystalline (LC) compounds were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, $^{1}_{}$H, $^{13}_{}$C-NMR and ESI-Mass spectro-scopic techniques. Liquid crystal properties were investigated by polarized optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. All the compounds exhibited mesophases such as nematic, smectic A and smectic C phases. The liquid crystalline effects were ascertained by changing the central atom in the heterocyclic ring and by increasing the length of the terminal alkyloxy chains which bring considerable improvements on the mesomorphic properties. The absorption and emission spectral studies of all the compounds were investigated and confirmed.</p>

				<title>A DFT study of temperature dependent dissociation mechanism of HF in HF(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>7</sub> cluster</title>

				<page>1839-1844</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report a Density Functional Theoretical (DFT) study of dissociation of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) in HF(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>7</sub> cluster, using B3LYP functional and empirical exchange correlation functional M06-2X along with 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. Dissociation constant, K<sub>RP</sub>, of HF dissociation and pK<sub>a</sub> values of HF in cluster at various temperatures have been reported. It has been found that both K<sub>RP</sub> and pK<sub>a</sub> are highly dependent on temperature. The variation of pK<sub>a</sub> with temperature suggests that HF is strong acid at lower temperatures. Our study also reveals that HF is a stronger acid in water cluster than in bulk water. Further, the results obtained by DFT calculations have been compared with the earlier reported results obtained from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. It is found that DFT results are qualitatively consistent with the results of MC simulation but quantitatively different.</p>

				<title>The kinetics of substitution reaction of oxydiacetate and thiodiacetate copper(II) complexes with 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2‚Äô-bipyridine</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1845-1852</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The kinetics of substitution reactions of the CuODA and CuTDA binary complexes (ODA = oxydiacetate, TDA = thiodiacetate) with 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,2‚Äô-bipyridine (bipy) were studied in aqueous and DMSO solutions. These reactions were monitored spectrometrically using the stopped-flow method in the UV range. The studies were carried out at three temperatures - 298.15, 303.15 and 308.15 K. The concentrations of the binary complexes were kept within the range of 0.2‚Äì0.5 mmol L<sup>‚àí1</sup>, whereas the concentration of phen or bipy was constant = 0.05 mmol L<sup>‚àí1</sup>. The values of the reaction rate constants were calculated based on the A &#8594; B reaction model. A linear relationship of the rate of the substitution reaction versus the concentration of the binary complex as well as temperature was observed. The impact of the type of the primary (ODA and TDA) and auxiliary ligands (phen and bipy) as well as the effect of solvent on the rate of substitution reaction have been discussed.</p>

In CP <b>3</b>, Cu(I) ions are connected by ùúá<sub>2</sub> -NCS ‚àí and ùúá<sub>2</sub>-4,4‚Äô-bptz ligands to form 2D saw-tooth wavy network. In addition, the photoluminescence properties of CPs <b>1-3</b> were also investigated in the solid state at room temperature.</p>

					<p>A series of neutral hexacoordinated nickel(II) complexes of formula [Ni<sup>II</sup> (<b>L</b>)X<sub>2</sub>] (where <b>L</b> = 3,4<i>-bis(2-pyridylmethylthio)toluene</i> with tetradentate N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> donor set and X = chloride (<b>1</b>), azide (<b>2</b>), cyanate (<b>3</b>) and isothiocyanate anion (<b>4</b>)) have been synthesized and isolated in pure form.

The study of interaction of the complexes with calf thymus DNA, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) using spectroscopic and physicochemical tools clearly indicates that the complexes interact with DNA via groove binding mode.</p>

				<title>Hydrophobic effect of silica functionalized with silylated Ti-salicylaldimine complex on limonene oxidation by aqueous hydrogen peroxide</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1905-1917</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This research work describes the effect of hydrophobicity in inducing the diffusion of alkene substrates to the catalytic active sites. The aim of this research is to improve the catalytic activity by tailoring the degree of hydrophobicity of the catalyst. Silica functionalized with solid non-silylated Ti-salicylaldimine complex was prepared at room temperature by mixing imine ligand and Ti(IV) sulphate solution. The amorphous, solid complex formed was further silylated with octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) to induce hydrophobicity. The composition of the resulting silica functionalized with silylated Ti-salicylaldimine complex was varied with Ti:OTMS molar ratio in the range of 1:1/4 to 1:4 at room temperature. The successful attachment of alkylsilyl groups to silica functionalized with Ti-salicylaldimine complex was proven by the FTIR and $_{}^{29}$Si solid state NMR spectra. The FTIR spectra showed increasing peak area for sp<sup>3</sup> C-H stretching mode (ca. 2919 cm<sup>‚àí1</sup> and 2850 cm<sup>‚àí1</sup>) and decreasing peak area for Si-OH band with increasing amount of OTMS. TGA showed less water content with higher amount of alkylsilyl groups in the catalyst. This is in agreement with the lower kinetic rate of water adsorption capacity for the hydrophobic catalysts prepared. It was observed that the hydrophobic, silica functionalized with silylated Ti-salicylaldimine complex exhibited higher substrate conversion and reusability compared to the non-silylated catalyst.</p>

				<title>Zinc zirconium phosphate as an efficient catalyst for chemoselective synthesis of 1,1-diacetates under solvent-free conditions</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1945-1955</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, a mild, rapid, and efficient method for the protection of aldehydes with acetic anhydride (AA) in the presence of zinc zirconium phosphate (ZPZn) as a nano catalyst, at room temperature is reported. Selective conversion of aldehydes was observed in the presence of ketones. Under these conditions, different aldehydes bearing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents were reacted with AA and the corresponding 1,1-diacetates (acylals) were obtained in high to excellent yields. The steric and electronic properties of the different substrates had a significant influence on the reaction conditions. Also, the deprotection of 1,1-diacetates has been achieved using this catalyst in water. This nanocatalyst was characterized by several physico-chemical techniques. It was recovered easily from the reaction mixture, regenerated and reused at least 7 times without significant loss in catalytic activity. This protocol has the advantages of easy availability, stability, reusability of the eco-friendliness, chemoselectivity, simple experimental and work-up procedure, solvent-free conditions and usage of only a stoichiometric amount of AA.</p>

					<p>An efficient and a facile route to spiro-ùõΩ-lactams is described. 3-allyl-3-methylthio-ùõΩ-lactams, which are synthesized through a Lewis acid mediated C-3 alkylation of the <i>trans</i>-3-chloro-3-methylthio-ùõΩ-lactams, undergo a facile intrasulfenyl cyclization reaction in the presence of halogens like bromine and iodine to give spiro ùõΩ-lactams in good yield. These halospiro-ùõΩ-lactams are then subjected to dehalogenation reaction using Raney-nickel. The resulting spiro-ùõΩ-lactams are further transformed into their sulfinyl and sulfonyl derivatives by using ùëö-chloroperbenzoic acid as an oxidant.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>1967-1976</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Superparamagnetic starch functionalized maghemite nanoparticles (SMhNPs) were synthesised by a co-precipitation method <i>via in situ</i> functionalization and used as nano-adsorbents for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous waste. The characterization of the prepared nanoparticles was done by XRD, FTIR, TEM and VSM techniques. Adsorption of Cr(VI) on the surface of superparamagnetic starch functionalized maghemite nano-adsorbents was investigated and the removal was higher in acidic pH as compared to that exhibited in basic medium. The adsorption of Cr(VI) by the SMhNPs followed pseudo-second order kinetics and the adsorption isotherm data fits well the Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The ùêæ<sub>F</sub> value for Cr(VI) removal by SMhNPs is found to be 24.76 mg.g<sup>‚àí1</sup>, which is significantly better than the adsorption capacities reported in literature for maghemite nanoparticles. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto the superparamagnetic starch functionalized maghemite nano-adsorbents is spontaneous and endothermic in nature.</p>

				<page>1977-1991</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new synthesis of the catechol-ùëÇ-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, entacapone (E-isomer) has been achieved under mild conditions by amine-mediated demethylation of the precursor 2-Cyano-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl) prop-2-eneamide, wherein the methoxyl group adjacent to a nitro group gets demethylated under nucleophilic attack. Similar demethylation was achieved on ethyl 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxy-5-nitrophenyl) prop-2-enoate, 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxy-5-nitrophenyl)-N,N-diethylprop-2-enamide, ethyl 2-cyano-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl) prop-2-enoate and ethyl 2-cyano-3-(4-methoxy-3-nitrophenyl) prop-2-enoate. The scope of demethylation has been studied. Analogues of ethyl 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxy-5-nitrophenyl) prop-2-enoate wherein a methoxyl group is not adjacent to a NO<sub>2</sub> group are unaffected and phenolic derivatives yield the amine salts. Entacapone has been converted to salts with organic bases. The crystal structure of the isomer of entacapone (Z-isomer), a significant human metabolite of E-isomer has been established. NMR methods for deriving E and Z geometry and other similar molecules have been successfully established, mainly by studying the proton coupled $_{}^{13}$C spectra. Preliminary studies reveal in vitro activity for some compounds against tuberculosis (TB) and dengue.</p>

					<p>Four types of copolymer-silica nanocomposites have been prepared via ring-opening grafting of ùõæ-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTS) as reactive coupling agent onto preformed copolymers of maleic anhydride (MA) with 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-dodecene and 1-octadecene and <i>in situ</i> hydrolysis (polycondensation) of side-chain ethoxysilane groups and tetraethoxysilane as a precursor in the presence of HCl catalyst. The copolymers of MA with 1-hexene, 1-octene and 1-dodecene were synthesized by free radical polymerization and another MA copolymer with 1-octadecene was supplied commercially as matrix copolymer. Chemical/physical structures, thermal behavior and morphology investigations of the generated hybrids were performed by FTIR, $_{}^{13}$C, $_{}^{29}$Si-NMR, TGA, SEM and TEM analysis methods. Nano-level hybridization through covalent bonding (amidization) between the anhydride unit of copolymers and amine group of APTS was observed, and nanosilica networks (hydrolysis) were obtained through acid catalyzed co-polycondensation of TEOS and ethoxysilane fragments from both coupling agent and precursor. Agreeing with $_{}^{29}$Si-NMR and TGA quantitative analysis results, the degree of hydrolysis of ethoxysilane groups varied from 51.0 to 60.9%, and the content of <i>in situ</i> generated silica particles was found to be around 70.7-75.7%. Thermal properties and thermal stability of the obtained hybrids were found to be enhanced with silica content. SEM analysis confirmed the formation of nanostructural hybrids with relatively fine distributed nanoparticles. TEM analyses of all the nanohybrids indicate the formation of spherical morphologies. These novel copolymer hybrids are expected to be a promising and efficient organonanofiller for the preparation of polymer nanocomposites with both dual functionality and compatibilizer effects.</p>

				<title>Copper inorganic-organic hybrid coordination compound as a novel L-cysteine electrochemical sensor: Synthesis, characterization, spectroscopy and crystal structure</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>2005-2014</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dinuclear coordination compound of Cu(II), namely, [Cu<sub>2</sub>(pydc)<sub>2</sub>(pz)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]¬∑2H<sub>2</sub>O, where pydc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid) and pz = pyrazine has been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectra (IR, UV-Vis), thermal (TG/DTG) analysis, magnetic measurements and single crystal X-ray diffraction. In the dimeric structure, the planar tridentate pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid dianion coordinates to a Cu(II) ion in a meridional fashion and defines the basal plane of the complex. The fourth equatorial coordination site is then occupied by a pyrazine molecule that functions as a linear bidentate ligand bridging two Cu(II) complexes to form a dimer. The axial positions of each Cu(II) complex are occupied by one water molecule to form a distorted square pyramidal geometry. The complicated hydrogen bonding network accompanied with C‚ÄìO¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ùúã and C‚ÄìH¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ùúã stacking interactions assemble the crystal structure of <b>1</b> into a fascinating supramolecular architecture. Electrochemical behavior of [Cu<sub>2</sub>(pydc)<sub>2</sub>(pz)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>] (Cu-PDAP) on the surface of carbon nanotube (CNTs) glassy carbon electrode (GCE) is described. Oxidation of cysteine on the surface of modified electrode was investigated with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the Cu-PDAP/CNTs film displays excellent electrochemical catalytic activities towards L-cysteine oxidation.</p>

					<p>This paper reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical studies of two 1:1 stoichiometric ratio cocrystals of 4,4'-bithiazole-2,2'-diamine (DABTZ) with 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (bpo) and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpa). These cocrystal compounds have been prepared by slow evaporation method and characterized by elemental and thermal analysis, FTIR, $_{}^{1}$H and $_{}^{13}$C-NMR spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystal analyses show that these structures [(DABTZ) (bpo)] and [(DABTZ) (bpa)] have crystallized in monoclinic forms with space groups of P2<sub>1</sub>/n and C<sub>2/c</sub>, respectively. These structures were studied theoretically and the results are in good agreement with the experimental data.</p>

					<p>Adsorption of CO, N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> and NO molecules on B<sub>36</sub> cluster was studied using density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP functional and 6-311+G(d,p) basis set.

The thermodynamic data showed that the B<sub>36</sub> cluster is a good adsorbent only for CO, O<sub>2</sub> and NO molecules. The calculated energies of adsorption of N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> O and H<sub>2</sub> on the B<sub>36</sub> cluster were positive values. CO molecule is adsorbed via the carbon atom more effectively, while the nitrogen atom of NO is adsorbed better than the oxygen atom. Also, when NO and O<sub>2</sub> are adsorbed synchronously via both atoms, they dissociate. The edge boron atoms of the B<sub>36</sub> cluster showed more reactivity than the inner atoms.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Crystals of 7,11-<i>bis</i>(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2,4-dimethyl-2,4-diazaspiro[5.5]undecane -1,3,5,9-tetraone were grown in polar solvents and subjected to single crystal X-ray diffraction. The molecular crystal is Triclinic, P-1, ùëé = 8.3734 (19) √Ö, ùëè = 12.382 (3) √Ö, ùëê = 12.871 (3) √Ö, ùõº = 66.639 (7)&#176; , ùõΩ = 85.148 (7)&#176;, ùõæ = 70.690 (6)&#176; , ùëâ = 1154.5 (5)√Ö<sup>3</sup>, ùëç = 2, D<sub>calc</sub> = 1.519 g cm<sup>‚àí3</sup>. The optimized molecular structure of the studied compound using B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) method showed good agreement with the X-ray structure. The electronic and spectroscopic properties of the title compound were predicted. The NBO calculations were used to calculate the natural atomic charges at the different atomic sites as well as the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions among the most significant natural orbitals. The high LP(N)&#8594; BD<sup>*</sup>(2)C-O ICT interaction energies indicate strong electron delocalization from the lone pair of the N-atoms of the pyrimidinetrione ring to the adjacent carbonyl groups. In contrast, the small LP(O)&#8594; BD<sup>*</sup>(1)C-H stabilization energies (E<sup>(2)</sup>) indicated weak C-H‚ÄîO interactions. Experimentally, the studied compound showed the most intense electronic transition band at 232 nm which is calculated using TD-DFT method as a shoulder at 231.3 nm (f=0.0832) and it belongs to H-3/H-1&#8594;L+1 and H-2&#8594;L+2 excitations. The GIAO calculated $_{}^{1}$H and $_{}^{13}$C NMR chemical shifts showed good correlations with the experimental data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Triarylamines containing 9ùêª‚àíXanthen‚àí9‚àíone core and aromatic units such as phenyl, naphthyl and p‚àímethoxyphenyl were synthesized by employing palladium catalyzed C‚àíN bond forming amination reaction in good yields. The photophysical studies revealed that the absorption and emission spectra are influenced by the nature of the peripheral amines. The photoemission spectra can be readily tuned in the range 483‚Äì532 nm (solution) and 525‚Äì576 nm (film) displaying green or yellow emission (film) depending on the nature of the amine segment with optical band gaps in the range 2.52‚Äì2.75 eV (film). The ionization potential and electron affinity were found to be in the range 5.332‚Äì5.686 eV and 2.705‚Äì2.776 eV, respectively. Thermal studies revealed that the synthesized compounds have good thermal stability with 5% and 10% weight loss at temperature ranging from 260‚Äì330&#176; C and 340‚Äì370&#176; C, respectively.</p>

				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>2073-2079</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This manuscript reports the determination of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of levofloxacin (LF) in two solvents, water and ethanol, by using surface tension, refractive index and absorbance measurements. The data thus obtained were used to calculate different thermodynamic parameters for micellization process like free energy of micellization, free energy of adsorption, entropy and enthalpy of micellization. The interaction of this drug with anionic surfactant (SDS) was also studied using UV/Visible spectroscopy and conductometry. With rise in temperature, CMC of the drug was found to decrease in ethanol and increase in aqueous solution indicating dominance of lipophobic desolvation over lipophilic desolvation in ethanol and reverse, in case of aqueous solution. A strong drug/surfactant interaction was found to exist. The data obtained from drug/surfactant interaction were also used to find different interaction parameters like partition constant, free energy of partition, binding constant and free energy of binding which are very useful to understand the phenomenon of solubilization.</p>

				<title>Theoretical approaches to control spin dynamics in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>2081-2109</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This article reviews theoretical approaches for controlling spin dynamics in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. We present fundamental theories in the history of NMR, namely, the average Hamiltonian and Floquet theories. We also discuss emerging theories such as the Fer and Floquet-Magnus expansions. These theories allow one to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, which is still the central problem in spin dynamics of solid-state NMR. Examples from the literature that highlight several applications of these theories are presented, and particular attention is paid to numerical integrators and propagator operators. The problem of time propagation calculated with Chebychev expansion and the future development of numerical directions with the Cayley transformation are considered. The bibliography includes 190 references.</p>

				<page>2111-2118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We describe a facile growth of chain-like Au nanostructures and their spontaneous transformation to multi-twined nanostructure using a mild reducing agent bisphenol A (BPA). The growth Au nanostructures involves the chemical reduction of HAuCl<sub>4</sub> by BPA in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as capping agent in alkaline condition without any seeds. Wire and chain-like Au nano-network structures with diameter in the range of 4 to 9 nm are obtained in the initial stage of the reaction. These chainlike nanostructures undergo spontaneous transformation into multi-twined nanostructures within 24 h. These nanocrystalline multi-twined structures have an average size of 80-90 nm. X-ray and selected area electron diffraction measurements reveal that the Au nanoparticles have (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of a face centered cubic structure. High resolution transmission electron microscopic measurement shows that the nanostructures are mainly composed of (111) lattice plane with twin boundaries. The concentration of HAuCl<sub>4</sub>, BPA and CTAB has pronounced effect in the growth of nanostructures. The multi-twined nanostructures are highly stable at room temperature over a period of one month and can be used for catalytic applications.</p>

				<title>Pyrolysis of 3-carene: Experiment, Theory and Modeling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>2119-2135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal decomposition studies of 3-carene, a bio-fuel, have been carried out behind the reflected shock wave in a single pulse shock tube for temperature ranging from 920 K to 1220 K. The observed products in thermal decomposition of 3-carene are acetylene, allene, butadiene, isoprene, cyclopentadiene, hexatriene, benzene, toluene and p-xylene. The overall rate constant for 3-carene decomposition was found to be $$\text{k/s}^{‚àí1} = 10^{(9.95¬±0.54)} \text{exp}(‚àí40.88 ¬± 2.71 \text{kcal mol}^{‚àí1}/\text{RT}).$$ <i>Ab-initio</i> theoretical calculations were carried out to find the minimum energy pathway that could explain the formation of the observed products in the thermal decomposition experiments. These calculations were carried out at B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and G3 level of theories. A kinetic mechanism explaining the observed products in the thermal decomposition experiments has been derived. It is concluded that the linear hydrocarbons are the primary products in the pyrolysis of 3-carene.</p>

				<title>Molecular structure and DFT investigations on new cobalt(II) chloride complex with superbase guanidine type ligand</title>
				<feature />
				<page>2137-2149</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The new [Co(btmgn)Cl<sub>2</sub>] complex and the 1,8-bis(tetramethylguanidino)naphthalene (btmgn) ligand were synthesized and characterized. The X-ray single crystal investigation showed distorted tetrahedral geometry around the Co(II) ion. The geometry of the btmgn and [Co(btmgn)Cl<sub>2</sub>] complex was optimized using the B3LYP/6‚Äì311G(d,p) method. The calculated geometric parameters at the optimized structure of the [Co(btmgn)Cl<sub>2</sub>] complex showed good agreement with our reported X-ray structure. The two tetramethylguanidino groups are in a cis-type position to the naphthalene ring plane both in the free and coordinated btmgn. The large red shift of the ùúà<sub>C=N</sub> mode upon coordination indicates the strong ligand‚Äìmetal interactions. The calculated natural charges using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis at the two coordinated Cl-atoms are not equivalent. Also the two LP(4)Cl$\rightarrow$LP*(3)Co intramolecular charge transfer interaction energies (E<sup>(2)</sup>) are 29.00 and 39.17 kcal/mol, respectively. The two Co-Cl bonds are not equivalent where the longer Co-Cl bond has more electronegative chlorine atom than the shorter one. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) study of the btmgn ligand showed that the N4 and N7 atoms are the most reactive nucleophilic centers for the coordination with the Co<sup>2+</sup> ion. The [Co(btmgn)Cl<sub>2</sub>] complex has higher polarizability (ùõº<sub>0</sub>), first hyperpolarizability (ùõΩ<sub>0</sub>) and lower energy gap (ùõ•E) than the free ligand. The TD-DFT calculations predicted the transition bands at 337.2 nm (f=0.2299, H$\rightarrow$L) and 342.6 nm (f=0.1465, H-2/H$\rightarrow$L) for the btmgn and [Co(btmgn)Cl<sub>2</sub>], respectively.</p>

				<title>Modeling the structure of SARS 3a transmembrane protein using a minimum unfavorable contact approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>2159-2169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>3a is an accessory protein from SARS coronavirus that is known to play a significant role in the proliferation of the virus by forming tetrameric ion channels. Although the monomeric units are known to consist of three transmembrane (TM) domains, there are no solved structures available for the complete monomer. The present study proposes a structural model for the transmembrane region of the monomer by employing our previously tested approach, which predicts potential orientations of TM ùõº-helices by minimizing the unfavorable contact surfaces between the different TM domains. The best model structure comprising all three ùõº-helices has been subjected to MD simulations to examine its quality. The TM bundle was found to form a compact and stable structure with significant intermolecular interactions. The structural features of the proposed model of 3a account for observations from previous experimental investigations on the activity of the protein. Further analysis indicates that residues from the TM2 and TM3 domains are likely to line the pore of the ion channel, which is in good agreement with a recent experimental study. In the absence of an experimental structure for the protein, the proposed structure can serve as a useful model for inferring structure-function relationships about the protein.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this work, the asymmetric ligands [1-(phenyl)-3-(2-nitro-4-methylphenyl)]triazene (1), [1-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(2-nitro-4-methylphenyl)]triazene (<b>2</b>), [1-(4-ethylphenyl)-3-(2-nitro-4-methylphenyl)]triazene (3) and [1-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-3-(2-nitro-4-methylphenyl)]triazene (<b>4</b>), were synthesized. The reaction of the ligand (3) with HgCl<sub>2</sub> in methanol resulted in the formation of the [HgL<sub>2</sub>] complex, (<b>5</b>). All compounds were characterized by means of CHN analysis, FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the crystal structures of the ligands (<b>2</b>) to (<b>4</b>) were investigated by single crystal X-ray analysis. In the solid state, all ligands exhibited <i>trans</i> conformation about the ‚ÄìN=N‚Äì double bond. The Hg<sup>II</sup> complex (<b>5</b>) crystallized in monoclinic system with ùê∂2/ùëê space group. The triazene ligand was found to be deprotonated prior to coordination and acts as monodentate ligand. The Hg<sup>II</sup> which lies on inversion center (site symmetry $\bar{1}$), is surrounded by two N atoms from <b>L</b> ligands forming a linear geometry. The other two Hg‚ÄìN bonds are relatively longer and can only be regarded as weak secondary bonds. Also, Hg-ùúÇ<sup>3</sup>-arene ùúã-interactions are present in this compound. Hydrogen bonds, ùúã ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ùúã and C‚ÄìH¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ùúã stacking interactions help in the stabilization of the resulted frameworks. These C‚ÄìH¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ùúã edge-to-face interactions are present with H¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ùúã distance of 3.00 √Ö.</p>

				<page>2183-2191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radical scavenging efficacy of L-cysteine (L-Cys), glutathione (GSH) and thioctic acid (TA) in the presence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were determined by 1,1-diphenyl 2-picryl hydrazil (DPPH), nitric oxide (NO) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals as spectrophotometric assay. The hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) scavenging efficacy has been determined by titration method. Ascorbic acid has been used as standard for all radical scavenging efficacies. In general, antioxidant activity decreases in the presence of AgNPs. The covalent interactions of thiols (-SH) were found to be a key factor for the decreases in scavenging activity. The effect of thiol concentrations has been discussed. The size and shape of the nanoparticles and AgNP-SR interactions have been characterized through Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, respectively.</p>

The Cu(II) center is coordinated by two oxygen and one nitrogen donors of L<sup>2‚àí</sup> and nitrogen atoms of the heterocyclic group. Electrochemical studies of the Cu(II) complex showed shifts in the ligand peaks as well as the appearance of new peaks after complexation. The electrochemical behavior of the Cu(II) complex was also studied using cyclic voltammetry.

				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed theoretical quantum chemical study on 4b,9b-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydro-4bH-indeno[1,2-b] benzofuran-9,10(6H,9bH)-dione (Dihydroxy-Dihydro-Indeno-Benzofuran-Dione) has been discussed. The structure of the title molecule has been optimized and the structural parameters have been calculated by DFT/B3LYP method with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The fundamental vibrational wavenumbers as well as their intensities were calculated and excellent agreement between observed and calculated wavenumbers has been achieved and was interpreted in terms of potential energy distribution analysis. The electronic properties such as HOMO and LUMO energies and associated frontier energy band gap were calculated. Thermodynamical parameters along with the nonlinear optical (NLO) behavior of the title molecule are also discussed. The lower value of frontier orbital energy gap and a higher value of dipole moment suggest that the title compound is highly reactive. The NLO behavior of the title compound has been achieved by dipole moment, polarizability and first static hyperpolarizability. The large value of hyperpolarizability ùõΩ<sub>total</sub>, indicates that the title molecule may serve as a good NLO material. The theoretical results were found to be in coherence with the measured experimental data.</p>

				<title>Quantum chemical investigation of thermochemistry in Calvin cycle</title>
				<feature />
				<page>2231-2240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work aims to verify the experimental thermochemistry of the reactions involved in Calvin cycle that produces glucose equivalent by using products from the light-activated reactions in chloroplast. The molecular geometry of each involved species in water has been optimized by density functional theory using SCRF-PCM methodology at M06-2X/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level. The thermal correction to Gibbs free energy of each solute has been calculated at the same level of theory. An explicit accounting of the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding has been made for each solute molecule by using theoretically determined values from different sources. These data have been added together to obtain the standard Gibbs free energy ùê∫<sup>&#8709;</sup> for each molecule in solution. Finally, the free energy change ùõ•ùê∫ of each involved reaction has been determined using the experimental concentrations under physiological conditions. The calculated ùõ•ùê∫ values are generally in good agreement with the experimentally found free energy changes, with only a few relatively large deviations. Five regulating steps with moderately large and negative ùõ•ùê∫ have been identified, whereas only three of them were clearly identified from experiment. We particularly show that the steps involving the formation of G3P from 3-PG and the regeneration of RuBP from Ru5P are thermodynamically strongly favored, and therefore, they take part in driving the metabolic process. We have illustrated Calvin cycle by vividly distinguishing the controlling steps from the potentially reversible reactions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ternary complexes of Sm(III) with dibenzoylmethane (dbm) were synthesized by introducing 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dmphen), 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (tmphen), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dpphen), 2,2-bipyridyl (bpy), 4,4‚Äô-dimethyl-2,2-bipyridyl (4,4-dmbpy), 5,5‚Äô-dimethyl-2,2-bipyridyl (5,5-dmbpy) and 4,4‚Äô-di-tert-butyl-2,2-bipyridyl (4,4-dtbbpy) as a second ligand. The complexes were isolated and characterized by elemental analysis (CHN), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), IR spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Structural study shows that in all complexes Sm(III) is in square antiprism geometry. All complexes emit strong luminescence under ultraviolet excitation. The strongest emission is at 643 nm which can be assigned for $^{4}_{}$G<sub>5/2</sub> to $^{6}_{}$H<sub>9/2</sub> transition, equivalent to energy of 15550 cm<sup>‚àí1</sup>. The addition of the second ligand has increased the emission intensity of the complexes while the transition is maintained.</p>

				<title>Synthesis and bioactive evaluations of novel benzotriazole compounds as potential antimicrobial agents and the interaction with calf thymus DNA</title>
				<feature />
				<page>2251-2260</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A novel series of benzotriazole derivatives were synthesized and characterized by NMR, IR and MS spectra. The bioactive assay manifested that most of the new compounds exhibited moderate to good antibacterial and antifungal activities against the tested strains in comparison to reference drugs chloromycin, norfloxacin and fluconazole. Especially, 2,4-dichlorophenyl substituted benzotriazole derivative <b>6f</b> displayed good antibacterial activity against MRSA with MIC value of 4 ùúág/mL, which was 2-fold more potent than Chloromycin, and it also displayed 3-fold stronger antifungal activity (MIC = 4 ùúág/mL) than fluconazole (MIC = 16 ùúág/mL) against <i>Beer yeast</i>. The preliminary interactive investigations of compound <b>6f</b> with calf thymus DNA revealed that compound <b>6f</b> could effectively intercalate into DNA to form compound <b>6f</b>‚ÄìDNA complex which might block DNA replication to exert antimicrobial activities. Molecular docking experiments suggested that compound <b>6f</b> projected into base-pairs of DNA hexamer duplex forming two hydrogen bonds with guanine of DNA. The theoretical calculations were in accordance with the experimental results.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two nanoporous perylene bis-imide linked metalloporphyrin framework catalysts have been synthesized via condensation of 5,10,15,20-<i>tetrakis</i>-(4&#x2032;-aminophenyl) iron(III) porphyrin chloride or 5,10, 15,20-<i>tetrakis</i>-(4&#x2032;-aminophenyl) manganese(III) porphyrin chloride with perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride. Both the materials were crystalline in nature and were characterized by electron microscopy techniques, solid-state <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C CP/MS NMR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The nitrogen gas physisorption study has indicated that both materials are porous in nature and have BET surface area with 653 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 974 m<sup>2</sup>/g with uniform pore size of 2.8 nm. These materials were found to act as very good heterogeneous catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes and alkenes with tert-butyl hydroperoxide and were not degraded even after multiple uses up to 10 cycles.</p>

				<title>Design and synthesis of ruthenium(II) OCO pincer type NHC complexes and their catalytic role towards the synthesis of amides</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0009-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present contribution describes the synthesis and characterization of a family of robust ruthenium complexes, supported by a tridentate pincer ligand of the type bis-phenolate-ùëÅ-heterocyclic carbene [<sup>ùë°Bu</sup>(OCO)<sup>2‚àí</sup>] (NHC). Ruthenium(II) complexes (<b>1-3</b>) bearing bis-phenolate-ùëÅ-heterocyclic carbene ligand were synthesized in good yields by the reaction of imidazolinium proligand (<b>HL</b>) with metal precursors [RuHCl(CO)(EPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(B)] (E = P or As; B = PPh<sub>3</sub>, AsPh<sub>3</sub> or Py) by transmetalation from the corresponding silver carbene complex. All the Ru(II)-NHC complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic methods as well as ESI mass spectrometry. Based on the spectral results, an octahedral geometry was assigned for all the complexes. The tridentate nature of the <sup>ùë°Bu</sup>(OCO)<sup>2‚àí</sup> ligand as well as some level of steric protection provided by the <sup>ùë°</sup>Bu groups may rationalize the excellent stability of the Ru-C<sub>carbene</sub> bond in the present systems. Moreover, for the explorations of catalytic potential of the synthesized compounds, all the three [Ru-NHC] complexes (<b>1-3</b>) were tested as catalysts for amidation of alcohols with amines. Notably, the complex <b>1</b> was found to be very efficient and versatile catalyst towards amidation of a wide range of alcohols with amines.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The lanthanide(III) complexes of general formula of [Ln(BPBH)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] (where, Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd and BPBH = 2-benzoylpyridine benzhydrazone) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, spectroscopic (UV, IR), electrochemical and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The coordination mode of the ligand and the geometry of [Ce(BPBH)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] are confirmed by single crystal X-ray studies. The crystals are monoclinic with C2/c crystallographic symmetry. The central metal is 12 coordinated and the coordination polyhedron around the cerium atom can be described as a distorted icosahedron. The existence of nitrate. . . ùúã and CH. . . ùúã stacking interactions in the [Ce(BPBH)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] leads to a supramolecular arrangement in its network. The binding properties of these complexes with calf-thymus DNA have been investigated by viscosity measurements. The complexes show more nuclease activity in the presences of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, a new thiourea derivative bearing benzothiazole ligand, 1-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)thiourea (btt) and its ternary metal (Cu(II), Co(II) and Ni(II)) complexes were synthesized. The structural characterization was carried out by micro analysis, IR, <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, EPR, UV-Visible spectral analyses, molar conductance and thermal analysis studies. Spectral studies of complexes revealed that the metal complexes have distorted octahedral geometry. Molecular modelling study was performed to evaluate the recognition of target compounds at the 3MNG binding pocket. The docking results revealed that copper complex selectively binds to the crucial amino acid residues in the active site of 3MNG. The <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activity of the ligand and its metal complexes was assayed by radical scavenging activity (DPPH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. The ligand showed moderate antioxidant activity whereas the metal complexes exhibited better antioxidant activity than that of the ligand. The results of the four methods proved that the copper complex is the most potent antioxidant among all the tested compounds.</p>

					<p>In this study, for the first time, MoO<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts and their potassium-promoted forms were prepared and tested for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Catalysts were characterized with XRD, BET, NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD, TPR and XPS methods. Catalytic activity measurement was done with quartz microreactor between 450 and 550&#xb0;C. It has been observed that the conversion of propane increased with temperature and total hydrocarbon selectivity increased with molybdenum oxide content. The acidity of catalysts decreased with potassium addition due to interaction with MoO<sub>3</sub> sites. For this reason total hydrocarbon selectivity highly increased.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The synthesis of substituted isoxazoles and pyrazoles through a general cycloisomerization methodology has been reported. The capability of gold(III) chloride to promote cycloisomerization of both ùõº, ùõΩ-acetylenic oximes and ùõº, ùõΩ-acetylenic hydrazones is the centrepiece of the strategy. A range of acetylenic precursors were investigated to afford 28 examples of the products with good to excellent chemical yields. Selected compounds were screened for their cytotoxic potential towards COLO320 cancer cell lines. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of the tested compounds were in the micromolar range, with the best compound, 5-(6-Methoxy-naphthalen-2-yl)-3-phenyl-isoxazole (<b>3h</b>) displaying an IC<sub>50</sub> of 38.9 ùúáM. For this compound, the crystal structure in complex with Aurora-A kinase was obtained which revealed details of its binding mode within the active site with a free energy of binding -9.54 kcal/mol.</p>

					<p>[3+2] cycloaddition reaction of various types of nitriles and sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>) were studied in the presence of nano-sized Cu-MCM-41 as an efficient recoverable heterogeneous catalyst. Nano-sized Cu-MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieves with various Si/Cu molar ratios were synthesized by direct insertion of metal ions at room temperature. The textural properties of the materials have been studied by means of XRD, FTIR, SEM and TEM techniques. Catalytic behavior of Cu-MCM-41 was also investigated by pyridine absorption and potentiometric titration. The reactions data verified characterization results and show that Cu-MCM-41 with Si/Cu molar ratio of 20 has considerably better catalytic activity compared to the other molar ratios. To investigate reusability, the catalyst was recovered by simple filtration and reused for several cycles with consistent activity.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new molecule consisting of a bithiazole chromophore sandwiched between two thiophenes, functionalized with benzothiophene unit at one end and cyanoacrylic acid at the other end (<b>BT1</b>) was synthesized, photophysical properties were studied and employed as a photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The molecule exhibited an intense absorption in the UV-visible region with absorption extending up to 500 nm. The ground and excited state potentials of <b>BT1</b> were calculated to be 1.29 and -0.65 V, respectively vs. NHE using cyclic voltammetry. The ground state energy level is more positive than the triiodide electrolyte and excited state energy level is considerably more negative than the TiO<sub>2</sub> satisfying the energetic requirements for a photosensitizer in DSSC. The solar cells fabricated from <b>BT1</b> exhibited an efficiency of 1.13%. The effect of various co-adsorbents (<b>CDCA</b>, <b>TP1</b> and <b>TP2</b>) on the DSSC performance was investigated in detail. In the presence of <b>CDCA</b>, the photovoltaic efficiency was enhanced to 1.25%, whereas, in the presence of <b>TP1</b> and <b>TP2</b>, the efficiency lowered to 0.20% and 0.59%, respectively. The increased efficiency in the presence of <b>CDCA</b> could be attributed to the prevention of the aggregation of dye molecules induced by <b>CDCA</b>. On the other hand, <b>TP1</b> and <b>TP2</b> were found to be not as effective as <b>CDCA</b> to prevent aggregation leading to the lowering of photoconversion efficiency.</p>

					<p>3-Phenyl-2-(1-ùêª-pyrrol-1-yl) propanoic acid has been used as a ketene source in synthesizing of monocyclic-2-azetidinones. Hindrance in ketene and imines successfully controlled the diastereoselectivity of the reaction. For example, in some cases only one isomer was achieved. By using Mukaiyama reagent, the leaving group in acid was activated and the by-products were separated by simple aqueous work-up. DFT calculation indicated that the benzyl-ùëÅ-pyrrolylketene has nonconjugated structure and the pyrrolyl ring is perpendicular to the ketene plane in both the twisted and planar structures.</p>

				<title>Effects of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> pressure on the emission of N,N&#x2032;-dialkylated perylene diimides in poly(alkyl methacrylate) films. Are guest-host alkyl group interactions important?</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0119-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Static and dynamic fluorescence measurements have been made on four ùëÅ,ùëÅ&#x2032;‚àídialkylated perylene diimides in films of poly(alkyl methacrylate)s (PAMAs) with 5 different alkyl groups and in a ‚Äòmodel solvent‚Äô, ùëõ-butyl acetate, over wide temperature ranges. The results indicate that the excited singlet states of the perylene guest molecules are controlled primarily by chain relaxations rather than hole free volumes in the polymer matrixes. The short singlet lifetimes of the perylene molecules require that the guest molecules respond primarily to the environments experienced by their ground states within the PAMA matrixes; each of the PAMAs offers slightly different locations in which the guest molecules can reside as a result of interactions between the ùëÅ‚àíalkyl substituents on the imide groups of the perylenes and the alkyl groups on the PAMA side chains. PAMAs with branched side chains were found to have a larger influence than PAMAs with linear side chains on the fluorescence properties of the guest molecules. The results are compared to those employing pyrenyl derivatives (with much longer excited singlet lifetimes) in the same PAMA films. The overall results indicate that the perylenes can be used as a complementary probe of local polymer chain dynamics, but they are less sensitive to their environments than are pyrenyl groups. However, they offer some distinct advantages:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>a much wider range of ùëÅ,ùëÅ&#x2032;‚àídisubstituted perylene diimides can be synthesized easily;</li>
						<li>those substituents can be designed to allow a greater or lesser interaction with an anisotropic host matrix. Also, rapid conformational changes of a bis-perylene derivative appear to be restricted in the polymer matrixes. Those restrictions appear reduced when the polymer films are placed under high pressures of the plasticizing gas, CO<sub>2</sub>, but not when they are under equal pressures of a much less intervening gas, N<sub>2</sub>.</li>

				<title>Impact of electric field on Hofmeister effects in aggregation of negatively charged colloidal minerals</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0141-0151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the aggregation kinetics of negatively charged colloidal minerals in Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub> , Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> solutions were measured and Hofmeister effects therein were estimated through total average aggregation (TAA) rates and critical coagulation concentration (CCC). Hofmeister effects of TAA rates increased exponentially with the increase in electric field strength, which cannot be explained by the classical theories (i.e., ionic size, hydration and dispersion forces), indicating strong electric field at colloidal surface was an indispensable factor in studying Hofmeister effects. Meanwhile, Hofmeister series of CCC values Na<sup>+</sup> &#x3e; K<sup>+</sup> &#x3e; NH<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub> &#x3e; Mg<sup>2+</sup> &#x3e; Ca<sup>2+</sup> &#x3e; Cu<sup>2+</sup> show fine correlation with the polarization of various cations, implying that onic polarization in strong electric field would be responsible for Hofmeister effects in aggregation of colloidal minerals, and the deduction was confirmed by the calculated results of electrostatic interactions between colloidal minerals.</p>

				<title>Anodization of Aluminium using a fast two-step process</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0153-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ultra-fast two-step anodization method is developed for obtaining ordered nano-pores on aluminium (Al) foil. First anodization was carried out for 10 min, followed by 3 min of second anodization at high voltage (150 V) compared to previous reports of anodization times of 12 h (40-60 V). The pore dimensions on anodized alumina are 180 nm for pore diameter and 130 nm for inter-pore distance. It was evident that by increasing the anodization voltage to 150 V, the diameter of the pores formed was above 150 nm. The electrolyte and its temperature affect the shape and size of the pore formation. At lower anodization temperature, controlled pore formation was observed. The anodized samples were characterized using the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) to determine the pore diameter and inter-pore distance. Using UVVisible spectroscopy, the reflectance spectra of anodized samples were measured. The alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) peaks were identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The x-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the Al 2p peak at 73.1 eV along with the oxygen O 1s at 530.9 eV and carbon traces C 1s at 283.6 eV.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ternary copper(II) complexes of salicylaldehyde-histamine Schiff base (HL) and pyridyl ligands, viz. [Cu(bpy)(L)](ClO<sub>4</sub>) (<b>1</b>) and [Cu(dppz)(L)](ClO<sub>4</sub>) (<b>2</b>), where bpy is 2,2&#x2032;-bipyridine (in <b>1</b>) and dppz is dipyrido[3,2-a:2&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-c]phenazine (in <b>2</b>), were synthesized, characterized and their DNA binding, photo-activated DNA cleavage activity and photocytotoxicity studied. The 1:1 electrolytic one-electron paramagnetic complexes showed a <i>d-d</i> band near 670 nm in aqueous DMF (1:1 v/v). The crystal structure of complex <b>1</b> showed the metal in CuN<sub>4</sub>O distorted square-pyramidal geometry. Complex <b>2</b> intercalatively binds to calf-thymus (ct) DNA with a binding constant (ùêæ<sub>b</sub>) of ‚àº10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>‚àí1</sup>. It exhibited moderate chemical nuclease activity but excellent DNA photocleavage activity in red light of 647 nm forming $^{\bullet}\text{OH}$ radicals. It showed remarkable photocytotoxicity in human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) giving IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.6 ùúáM in visible light (400-700 nm) with low dark toxicity. The photo-induced cell death is via generation of oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Reactions of copper(I) halides with p-chlorobenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (H<sup>1</sup>L) and triphenylphosphine in 1 : 1 : 2 molar ratio yielded complexes of stoichiometry, [CuX(ùúÇ<sup>1</sup>-S- H<sup>1</sup>L)(Ph<sub>3</sub>P)<sub>2</sub>] (X = I, 1: Br, 2; Cl, 3). All the three complexes were characterized using analytical (CHNS) and spectroscopic (IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR) techniques. The structure of complex 3 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. It has been found to crystallize in the triclinic system with space group P-1 and unit cell parameters: a = 10.207(5) √Ö, b = 13.027(5) √Ö, c = 16.269(5) √Ö, ùõº = 100.054(5)&#xb0;, ùõΩ = 99.228(5)&#xb0; and ùõæ = 97.234(5)&#xb0;. This complex has distorted tetrahedral geometry with two phosphorus atoms from two triphenylphosphine ligands, thione sulfur of thiosemicarbazone ligand and chloride ion occupying the four corners of the tetrahedron. The structure of complex 3 was in contrast to sulfur-bridged dinuclear complex of copper(I) chloride with benzaldehydethiosemicarbazone, [Cu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(ùúá<sub>2</sub>-S-Hbtsc)<sub>2</sub>(Ph<sub>3</sub>P)<sub>2</sub>]¬∑2H<sub>2</sub>O.

				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0193-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Synthesis of Schiff bases linked to organopropylsilatranes were performed by condensation reaction of post-functionalized silatranes such as aminopropylsilatrane (<b>4</b>), aminopropyl-3,7,10-trimethylsilatrane (<b>5</b>) and N-substituted aminopropylsilatrane (<b>10</b>) with two different aldehydes <i>viz</i>. pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde and 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde. The resulting Schiff base substituted silatranes were well characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopic studies [IR, (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C) NMR, and MS]. The structures of two silatranes were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Two analogous tripodal ligands, namely, 1,3,5-tris(benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene (<b>1-Et</b>) and 1,3,5-tris(benzimidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethoxybenzene (<b>1-OMe</b>) have been used for complexation with silver(I) tetrafluoroborate. A trinuclear Ag(I) salt, formulated as $\mathbf{[Ag_3(1-Et)_2]^{3+}(BF_4){}^{‚àí}_{3}\bullet 7CH_3CN\bullet yH_2O}$ was formed in the complexation reaction of <b>1-Et</b> with silver(I) tetrafluoroborate, which consists of a trigonal prismatic cation formed by three bicoordinated Ag(I) coordinated with two <b>1-Et</b> ligands. In case of the <b>1-OMe</b> ligand, however, a one dimensional ladder, formulated as $\mathbf{[(Ag(1-OMe)OH_2)^{+}(BF_4)^{‚àí}\bullet MeOH]_{\infty}}$ was obtained which is constituted of a tetracoordinated Ag(I) center in a distorted tetrahedral environment. The crystal structures of the ligand hydrates namely $\mathbf{1-Et\bullet H_2O}$ and $\mathbf{1-OMe\bullet 3.6H_2O}$ have been discussed along with the structure of methanol <i>solvate-hydrate</i> of <b>1-Et</b>. The imidazole rings of the <b>Bim</b> groups in <b>1-Et</b> in the crystal structures of the ligand as well as in its coordination complex with the Ag(I) are pointed inward with respect to the central ring, whereas it is pointed outwards in the crystal structures of <b>1-OMe</b> as well as its Ag(I) complex.</p>

				<title>Ammoxidation of 2-methyl pyrazine to 2-cyano pyrazine on MoO<sub>3</sub>/FePO<sub>4</sub> catalysts</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0227-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of this work is to understand the influence of small amount of Mo=O (1, 3 and 5wt.% MoO<sub>3</sub>) impregnated on FePO<sub>4</sub> and its resultant effect on the acidity was studied for the ammoxidation of 2-methyl pyrazine (2-MP) to 2-cyano pyrazine (2-CP) in the temperature range of 380‚Äì420&#xb0;C. The Mo/FeP catalyst characteristics were evaluated by XRD, HAADF-EDS, TPR and NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD techniques. Primarily, quartz-type XRD phase was observed for the iron phosphate (FeP). The Mo/FeP exhibits MoO<sub>3</sub> and quartztype iron phosphate phase. The interface between Mo particles (20 nm) and FeP was clearly established by HR-TEM in 3Mo/FeP. Furthermore, the average atomic composition revealed by HAADF/EDS for 3Mo/FeP as Fe 30.0%, P 40.0% and Mo 1.6% with Fe/Mo surface XPS ratio 6. The greater 2-CP yield of 68.0% on 3Mo/FeP was attributed to enhanced, moderate acid sites coming from MoO<sub>3</sub> and cooperation between Mo and FeP at the interface in terms of oxygen and electron transfer to the reactant (2-MP).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The acid isomerization of N-acyl-2,2-dimethylaziridines <b>1</b> in concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature leads to oxazolines <b>2</b> but the neutral hydrolysis of <b>1</b> in pure water at room temperature leads to amidoalcohols <b>3</b>. However, the use of aqueous solutions of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at different concentrations at room temperature leads to a mixture of oxazolines <b>2</b>, amidoalcohols <b>3</b> and allylamides <b>4</b> with yields depending on the acidity of the medium and the nature of the acyl group. A mechanism has been suggested to explain the formation of these three products. DFT calculations employing the Gaussian 09 program with DFT/B3LYP methods and 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set were carried out which gave the most stable geometry as well as their atomic charge distributions of compounds <b>1-4</b>.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The catalytic effect of palladium(II) on the oxidation of L-tryptophan by potassium hexacyanoferrate( III) has been investigated spectrophotometrically in aqueous perchloric acid medium. A first order dependence in [hexacyanoferrate(III)] and fractional-first order dependences in both [L-tryptophan] and [palladium(II)] were obtained. The reaction exhibits fractional-second order kinetics with respect to [H<sup>+</sup>]. Reaction rate increased with increase in ionic strength and dielectric constant of the medium. The effect of temperature on the reaction rate has also been studied and activation parameters have been evaluated and discussed. Initial addition of the reaction product, hexacyanoferrate(II), does not affect the rate significantly. A plausible mechanistic scheme explaining all the observed kinetic results has been proposed. The final oxidation products are identified as indole-3-acetaldehyde, ammonium ion and carbon dioxide. The rate law associated with the reaction mechanism is derived.</p>

				<title>Unexpected regiospecific formation and DNA binding of new 3-(acridin-9-yl)methyl-2-iminothiazolidin-4-ones</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0269-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New 3-(acridin-9-yl)methyl-2-substituted imino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones were regiospecifically synthesized from unstable (acridin-9-yl)methyl thioureas and methyl bromoacetate (MBA) or bromoacetyl bromide (BAB). Unexpected formation of only one thiazolidinone regioisomer with both the reagents was due to a new mechanism involving a transient spiro 9,10-dihydroacridine intermediate. These results are in contrast with the reactions of acridin-9-yl thioureas with MBA/BAB that afforded two different thiazolidinone regioisomers with these reagents. UV-vis titrations, CD spectra, and fluorescence quenching have shown that new products intercalated into calf thymus (CT) DNA, and displaced ethidium bromide (EB) from a CT DNA‚ÄìEB complex. Intrinsic binding constants, ùêæ<sub>ùëè</sub>, and Stern-Volmer constants, ùêæ<sub>ùëÜùëâ</sub> , were found in the range 0.79&#x2715;10<sup>5</sup> ‚Äì 2.85&#x2715;10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>‚àí1</sup> and 17950 ‚Äì 3360M<sup>‚àí1</sup>, respectively. The strongest binding affinity was found for an electrondonated 2-(4-methoxyphenylimino) thiazolidinone. Additional evidence for DNA intercalation was obtained from thermal denaturation studies. Gel electrophoresis has proven that thiazolidinone products nicked the supercoiled plasmid DNA in 5.0 ùúáM concentration.</p>

				<title>Theoretical insights into the cycloaddition reaction mechanism between ketenimine and methyleneimine: An alternative approach to the formation of pyrazole and imidazole</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0279-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The cycloaddition reaction mechanism between interstellar molecules, ketenimine and methyleneimine, has been systematically investigated employing the second-order M√∏ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method in order to better understand the reactivity of nitrogenous cumulene ketenimine with the C=N double bond compound methyleneimine. Geometry optimizations and vibrational analyses have been performed for the stationary points on the potential energy surfaces of the system. Calculations show that five-membered cyclic carbene intermediates could be produced through pericyclic reaction processes between ketenimine and methyleneimine. Through the subsequent hydrogen transfer processes, carbene intermediates can be isomerized to the pyrazole and imidazole compounds, respectively. The present study is helpful to understand the formation of prebiotic species in interstellar space.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present restricted geometry (collinear and perpendicular approaches of proton) <i>ab initio</i> three dimensional potential energy surfaces for H<sup>+</sup>+ CN system. The calculations were performed at the internally contracted multi-reference configuration interaction level of theory using Dunning‚Äôs correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta basis set. Adiabatic and quasidiabatic surfaces have been computed for the ground and the first excited electronic states. Nonadiabatic effects arising from radial coupling have been analyzed in terms of nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements and coupling potentials.</p>

				<title>Functionalized organic frameworks explored as second order NLO agents</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0297-0309</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new class of chiral phthalimides functionalized with aryl piperazines was designed anticipating their strong candidature for crystal engineering and technological applications. Five new phthalimides were synthesized, characterized and subjected to single crystal X-ray diffraction study that directed their noncentrosymmetric structures. Four phthalimides crystallized in ùëÉ2<sub>1</sub> space group with monoclinic crystal system, however, one was found to possess ùëÉ2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> space group with orthorhombic system. The supramolecular architectures of phthalimide crystals were analysed by an approach based on consideration of energy of intermolecular interaction. The molecular hyperpolarizability (ùõΩ) calculation for all the listed phthalimides indicated their promising candidature for NLO materials. Further, the crystalline form of all phthalimides was evaluated for their second harmonic generation (SHG) response. A significant response of 16.4mV was measured for phthalimide possessing t-butyl substituent at the para position of 4-benzylpiperazine. This high SHG response may be attributed to the molecular chirality and helical supramolecular frameworks stabilized by C-H¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑O hydrogen bonds in the solid state. The current study attests chiral phthalimides possessing arylpiperazines as effective nominees to the area of crystal engineering and nonlinear optics.</p>

				<title>Does oligomerization in fused thiophene affect reactivity and aromaticity?</title>
				<feature>Regular Articles</feature>
				<page>0311-0324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reactivity and aromaticity of a few fused thiophene oligomers and their conformers are discussed in the light of density functional theory (DFT) and conceptual density functional theory. Reactivity parameters, such as hardness (ùúÇ) and electrophilicity (ùúî), chemical potential (ùúá) and energy of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) have been studied. Oligomerization raises the ùê∏<sub>HOMO</sub> of the species, which in turn increases the reactivity of the oligomers. The absorption spectra of the species are analysed using TDDFT (time dependent density functional theory). The absorption peaks show red shift with increasing size of the oligomers. Aromaticity of the species is gauged by nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS). The out-of-plane component, (NICS<sub>zz</sub>) values advocate higher aromatic character at longer distance whereas, NICS supports the reverse.</p>
