				<title>Important Crustal Growth in the Phanerozoic: Isotopic Evidence of Granitoids from East-Central Asia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0005-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The growth of the continental crust is generally believed to have been essentially completed in the Precambrian, and the amount of juvenile crust produced in the Phanerozoic is considered insignificant. Such idea of negligible growth in the Phanerozoic is now challenged by the revelation of very large volume of juvenile crust produced in the period of 500 to 100 Ma in several orogenic belts. While appreciable volumes of juvenile terranes in North America (Canadian Cordillera, Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Range, Appalachians) have been documented based on Nd isotopic data, the mass of new crust formed in the East-Central Asian Orogenic Belt (ECAOB), eastern part of the Altaid Tectonic Collage, appears to be much greater than the above terranes combined. New and published Nd-Sr isotope data indicate that the Phanerozoic granitoids from the southern belt of the ECAOB (Xinjiang-West Mongolia-Inner Mongolia-NE China) as well as from Mongolia and Transbaikalia were generated from sources dominated by a depleted mantle component. These granitoids represent a significant growth of juvenile crust in the Phanerozoic.</p>
					<p>Although most plutons in this huge orogenic belt belong to the calc-alkaline series, the ECAOB is also characterized by the emplacement of voluminous A-type granites. The origin of these rocks is probably multiple and is still widely debated. However, the isotopic data (Sr-Nd-O) and trace element abundance patterns of A-type granites from the ECAOB clearly indicate their mantle origin.</p>
					<p>The evolution of the ECAOB and the entire Altaid Collage is most likely related to successive accretion of arc complexes. However, the emplacement of a large volume of post-tectonic A-type granites requires another mechanism, probably through a series of processes including underplating of massive basaltic magma, partial melting of these basic rocks to produce granitic liquids, followed by extensive fractional crystallization. The proportion of juvenile to recycled, as well as that of arc-related to plume-generated, continental crust remains to be evaluated by more systematic dating and isotope tracer studies.</p>

				<title>Anasagar gneiss: A folded granitoid pluton in the Phanerozoic South Delhi Fold Belt, central Rajasthan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0022-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Anasagar gneiss was emplaced as a concordant sheet like body along the contact of quartzite and pelitic/semipelitic schist horizons in the northern part of the South Delhi Fold Belt. It is typically a granite gneiss containing megacrysts of K-feldspar set in a recrystallised foliated matrix. The megacrysts are in general converted to granular aggregates, often retaining their crystal outline. Garnet, sillimanite (fibrolite) and rarely staurolite are the metamorphic minerals in the gneiss; these are also present in the enveloping supracrustal rocks. Both the gneiss and the supracrustal rocks are involved in polyphase deformation. F1 isoclinal folds are present only on minor scale in the supracrustal rocks. F2 major and minor folding have affected both the gneiss and the supracrustal rocks. These are asymmetrical folds with alternate flat and steep, locally overturned, limbs and have consistent easterly vergence. F3 folds are upright and coaxial with F2. F4 puckers and large scale warps have E-W to ESE-WNW subvertical axial planes. The gneiss is exposed in the core of an F3 arch on the flat limb of a major F2 antiform whose axial trace is bent by an F4 fold. The intrusion was pre-F2 and late-tectonic with F1. U-Pb zircon dating suggests a crystallization age of 1849 ± 8 Ma. Hence the Anasagar gneiss is older than the late- to post-tectonic ``Erinpura-type'' granite in the South Delhi Fold Belt.</p>

				<title>Emplacement of Amba Dongar Carbonatite-alkaline Complex at Cretaceous/Tertiary Boundary: Evidence from 40Ar-39Ar Chronology</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0039-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><sup>40</sup>Ar$-$<sup>39</sup>Ar analyses of three fresh alkaline rock samples and a phlogopite separate from a carbonatite from Amba Dongar carbonatite-alkaline complex of the Deccan Flood Basalt Province, India, yield indistinguishable precise plateau ages of 64.8 ± 0.6, 64.7 ± 0.5, 65.5 ±  0.8 and 65.3 ± 0.6 Ma, giving a mean plateau age of 65.0 ± 0.3 Ma, which is the age of emplacement of this complex. This age implies contemporaneity of Amba Dongar with several other carbonatite-alkaline activities of Chhota Udaipur subprovince and is consistent with their Reunion-Deccan plume origin hypothesis. The emplacement of these complexes at 65 Ma makes them very significant in the ongoing debate on the K/T extinctions owing to their capacity to rapidly inject a substantial amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Sr Isotopic Evidence on the Spilitic Degradation of the Deccan Basalt</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0049-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Similar Sr isotopic ratios (∼0.7055) for the tholeiite-spilite flow unit and the associated mineral phases, of Bombay (Deccan Traps) provide a direct evidence for the spilitic degradation of tholeiite. In contrast, a dramatic increase in the rare earth elements (REE) from basalt to spilite is rather puzzling as rare earths are considered to be relatively immobile. The geochemistry thus suggests that the process of spilitization is due to the reaction with a complex fluid having identical Sr-isotopic composition as that of the basaltic magma - thereby masking the details of the mixing process.</p>

				<title>Sm-Nd Ages of Two Meta-Anorthosite Complexes Around Holenarsipur: Constraints on the Antiquity of Archean Supracrustal Rocks of the Dharwar Craton</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0057-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Whole-rock Sm-Nd isochron ages are reported for two stratiform meta-anorthosite complexes emplaced into the Archean supracrustal-gneiss association in the amphibolite facies terrain around Holenarsipur, in the Dharwar carton, South India.  While these metaperidotite-pyroxenite-gabbro-anorthosite complexes are petrologically and geochemically similar, they differ in the intensity of tectonic fabric developed during the late Archean (c.2.5Ga) deformation.  They also differ in their whole-rock Sm-Nd isochron ages and initial Nd isotopic compositions: 3.285 ± 0.17 Ga, 𝜀 Nd = 0.82 ± 0.78 for the Honnavalli meta-anorthosite complex from a supracrustal enclave in the low-strain zone, and 2.495 ± 0.033 Ga, 𝜀 Nd = $-2.2+-0.3$ for the Dodkadnur meta-anorthosites from the high-strain southern arm of the Holenarsipur Supracrustal Belt (HSB).  We interpret these results as indicating that the magmatic protoliths of both meta-anorthosite complexes were derived from a marginally depleted mantle at c.3.29 Ga but only the Dodkadnur rocks were isotopically reequilibrated on a cm-scake about 800 Ma later presumably due to the development of strong penetrative fabrics in them during Late Archean thermotectonic event around 2.5Ga.  Our results set a younger age limit at c.3.29Ga for the supracrustal rocks of the HSB in the Dharwar craton.</p>

				<title>Compilation of Radiogenic Isotope Data in Mexico and their Petrogenetic Implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0067-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seven hundred and twenty-five Sr, two hundred and forty-three Nd and one hundred and fifty-one Pb isotopic ratios from seven different Mexican magmatic provinces were compiled in an extensive geochemical database. Data were arranged according to the Mexican geological provinces, indicating for each province total number of analyses, range and mean of values and two times standard deviation (2𝜎). Data from seven provinces were included in the database: Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB), Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), Baja California (BC), Pacific Ocean (PacOc), Altiplano (AP), Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS), and Sierra Madre Oriental (SMOr). Isotopic values from upper mantle and lower crustal xenoliths, basement outcrops and sediments from the Cocos Plate were also compiled. In the MVB the isotopic ratios range as follows: <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr 0.703003$-$0.70841; <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd $0.512496-0.513098$; <sup>206</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $18.567-19.580$; <sup>207</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $15.466-15.647$; <sup>208</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $38.065-38.632$. The SMO shows a large variation in <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ranging from ~ 0.7033 to 0.71387. <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd ratios are relatively less variable with values from 0.51191 to 0.51286. Pb isotope ratios in the SMO are as follows: <sup>206</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $18.060-18.860$; <sup>207</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $15.558- 15.636$; <sup>208</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $37.945-38.625$. PacOc rocks show the most depleted Sr and Nd isotopic ratios ($0.70232-0.70567$ for Sr and $0.512631-0.513261$ for Nd). Pb isotopes for PacOc show the following range: <sup>206</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $18.049-19.910$; <sup>207</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $15.425-15.734$; <sup>208</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb $37.449-39.404$. The isotopic ratios of the AP rocks seem to be within the range of those from the PacOc.</p>
					<p>Most samples with reported Sr and Nd isotopic data are spread within and around the ``mantle array''. The SMO seems to have been formed by a mixing process between mantle derived magmas and continental crust. The MVB appears to have a larger mantle component, with AFC as the dominant petrogenetic process for the evolved rocks. There is still a need for Pb isotopic data in all Mexican magmatic provinces andofNdisotopes in BC,AP, SMS, and SMOr.</p>

				<title>Error Propagation in Equations for Geochemical Modeling of Radiogenic Isotopes in Two-Component Mixing</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0079-0088</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents error propagation equations for modeling of radiogenic isotopes during mixing of two components or end-members. These equations can be used to estimate errors on an isotopic ratio in the mixture of two components, as a function of the analytical errors or the total errors of geological field sampling and analytical errors. Two typical cases (``Small errors'' and ``Large errors'') are illustrated for mixing of Sr isotopes. Similar examples can be formulated for the other radiogenic isotopic ratios. Actual isotopic data for sediment and basalt samples from the Cocos plate are also included to further illustrate the use of these equations. The isotopic compositions of the predicted mixtures can be used to constrain the origin of magmas in the central part of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. These examples show the need of high quality experimental data for them to be useful in geochemical modeling of magmatic processes.</p>

				<title>Isotopic Composition of Xenon in Petroleum from the Shell Bullwinkle Field</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have measured the abundance and isotopic composition of xenon in petroleum samples from the Shell Bullwinkle Field off the coast of Louisiana. We used an oxidation and purification procedure designed to insure complete extraction and clean up of xenon from the petroleum.</p>
					<p>The xenon isotopic composition was found to be similar to the atmospheric value for one petroleum sample. While the results of the second sample suggest possible enrichment of the heavier isotopes, the errors associated with these excesses preclude a definitive statement to that effect. No monoisotopic enrichment in <sup>129</sup>Xe was detected in either sample, the presence of which might have allowed us to deduce the petroleum age. Our results represent only the second xenon measurement from petroleum, and the concentrations are within the range of values published in the earlier report.</p>

				<title>Factors Controlling the Groundwater Transport of U, Th, Ra, and Rn</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0095-0108</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A model for the groundwater transport of naturally occurring U, Th, Ra, and Rn nuclides in the <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>Th decay series is discussed. The model developed here takes into account transport by advection and the physico-chemical processes of weathering, decay,  𝛼-recoil, and sorption at the water-rock interface. It describes the evolution along a flowline of the activities of the <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>Th decay series nuclides in groundwater. Simple sets of relationships governing the activities of the various species in solution are derived, and these can be used both to calculate effective retardation factors and to interpret groundwater data. For the activities of each nuclide, a general solution to the transport equation has been obtained, which shows that the activities reach a constant value after a distance $\bar{x}_i$, characteristic of each nuclide. Where   $\bar{x}_i$ is much longer than the aquifer length, (for <sup>238</sup>U, <sup>234</sup>U, and <sup>232</sup>Th), the activities grow linearly with distance. Where  $\bar{x}_i$  is short compared to the aquifer length, (for <sup>234</sup>Th, <sup>230</sup>Th, <sup>228</sup>Th, <sup>228</sup>Ra, and <sup>224</sup>Ra), the activities rapidly reach a constant or quasi-constant activity value. For <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>222</sup>Rn, the limiting activity is reached after 1 km.</p>
					<p>High 𝛿<sup>234</sup>U values (proportional to the ratio 𝜀<sub>234</sub>Th/<sup>W238</sup>U) can be obtained through high recoil fraction and/or low weathering rates. The activity ratios <sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>232</sup>Th, <sup>228</sup>Ra/<sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>224</sup>Ra/<sup>226</sup>Ra have been considered in the cases where either weathering or recoil is the predominant process of input from the mineral grain. Typical values for weathering rates and recoil fractions for a sandy aquifer indicate that recoil is the dominant process for Th isotopic ratios in the water. Measured data for Ra isotope activity ratios indicate that recoil is the process generally controlling the Ra isotopic composition in water. Higher isotopic ratios can be explained by different desorption kinetics of Ra. However, the model does not provide an explanation for <sup>228</sup>Ra/<sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>224</sup>Ra/<sup>226</sup>Ra activity ratios less than unity.</p>
					<p>From the model, the highest <sup>222</sup>Rn emanation equals 2𝜀. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that <sup>222</sup>Rn activity can be used as a first approximation for input by recoil (Krishnaswami et al 1982). However, high <sup>222</sup>Rn emanation cannot be explained by production from the surface layer as formulated in the model. Other possibilities involve models including surface precipitation, where the surface layer is not in steady-state.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Stable hydrogen (𝛿D) and oxygen (𝛿<sup>18</sup>O) isotope ratios of the headwaters of the Indus and its tributaries, surface ice in glaciers, saline and fresh water lakes and thermal springs in the Himalayan and Trans- Himalayan (Kashmir) region are reported. The 𝛿D-𝛿<sup>18</sup>O relationship for the river samples shows a slope of 9.12 ± 0.29 which agrees well with the estimate of 8.99 ± 0.33 based on a simple Rayleigh fractionation model. The unique signature of a higher deuterium excess (d) of the `Western Disturbance' is preserved in these samples. An altitude effect of -0.9 per mil/km is observed in the 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O of Indus waters. At a lower altitude (Beas) the altitude effect is almost double, indicating that the altitude effect decreases with elevation in this region.</p>

				<title>Climatic significance of D/H and <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratios in Irish oak cellulose</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0117-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>𝛿D and 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C analyses of cellulose nitrate from two modern Irish oak trees that form part of the 7400 year long chronology were carried out, covering a period of 123 years (1861-1983 A.D.) with a 5 year resolution so as to assess the potential of this long chronology for retrieval of palaeoenvironmental data. One of the trees (Q5293) showed significant correlations of 𝛿D, 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C and ring width with mean annual temperatures as recorded at the Armagh weather station nearby and the mean fall temperatures of Central England. The other tree (Q5296) did not exhibit any significant climatic correlations either because it grew utilizing a nearby permanent source of ground water or because the intra-ring isotopic variations in Irish oak are significant enough to mask the climatic signal. Whilst our results have given a positive indication of the usefulness of these trees for palaeoenvironmental information, more trees need to be analysed to confirm our findings.</p>
					<p>Even though one of the trees did not exhibit climatic correlations, both trees show a significant positive correlation of 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C and a negative correlation of 𝛿D with ring width variations. Furthermore, two tree samples that grew during the 1620s B.C., when a volcano is thought to have erupted on the Aegean island of Santorini, show increased 𝛿D and decreased 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C for one to two decades following the eruption, though the magnitudes of change seem to vary with site and trees. We have proposed a possible mechanism based on tree phenology to explain both the above effects.</p>

				<title>Late Glacial and Holocene  Paleoliminology of two temperate lakes inferred from sediment organic 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C chronology</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0129-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stable carbon isotope (𝛿<sup>13</sup>C) and elemental C/N ratios in Total Organic Carbon (TOC) extracted from radiometrically dated cores from two Midwestern USA lakes were determined to investigate the factors that control these values in temperate lakes. The range of 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C values ( -26 to -32%) and C/N ratios (mean value ∼ 10.8) are typical of values reported for other temperate lake organic matter in this region. In the core from Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, a negative correlation was seen between the TOC and 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C, which can be interpreted in terms of a re-mixing and consumption of sedimented organic carbon along with rapid equilibration throughout the water column. No correlation was seen between the TOC and 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C in the record from Ladd Lake, Ohio, implying that in this latter lake productivity alone was not a singular process controlling the isotope ratio. Here, it is suggested that equilibrium conditions are maintained such that the DIC of the water is never depleted of aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> during high organic production and the resulting 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C of the organic carbon lacks correlation with the TOC. Further, in this lake a fine resolution analysis was carried out which indicated a possible anthropogenic influence on the isotope ratio around times when human settlement (∼ 300 yrs ago) and enhanced agricultural practices ( ∼ 80 yrs ago) were significant. The study shows that carbon isotope studies are useful in paleolimnologic investigations.</p>

				<title>Is there a stable isotope evidence for the CO2 fertiliser effect</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0141-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has been suggested that part of the so-called ''missing sink'' of carbon dioxide introduced into the atmosphere by anthropogenic activities, that is the imbalance between estimated anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and oceanic uptake, may be stored in the vegetation in midlatitudes. Precise mecha- nisms of abstraction of additional carbon dioxide by vegetation, also known as the ``fertilization effect'', are poorly understood. Stable carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of cellulose extracted from annual growth rings (covering the time period 1980-1993) in an oak tree from Kalamazoo, SW Michigan provide a basis to investigate at a physiological level how the fertilization effect may operate. The carbon isotope ratios show that the intercellular concentration of carbon dioxide increased due to an increase in stomatal opening. Although increased intercellular concentration of carbon dioxide translated to increased Water Use Efficiency and assimilation rates, it also resulted in increased transpiration rate as shown by higher D/H of the fixed carbon. The two-fold significance of the isotope data are: first, they provide the first field evidence based on isotope studies for excess CO<sub>2</sub> induced biomass production and second, they suggest that this mechanism is likely to operate only in limited environments. Vegetation in regions where mois- ture availability is not restricted so that there can be a gain in water use efficiency despite increased leaf evaporation are best suited to sequester excess carbon from the atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Effect of intraband variability on stable isotope and density time series obtained from banded corals</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0145-0151</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Density, 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O and 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C were measured along two tracks, one close to the central growth axis and the other, ∼20&#176; off the axis, in a coral (Porites lutea) collected from the Stanley Reef, Central Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O variations in the coral are well correlated with sea surface temperature changes. The common variances between the two tracks were about 60% in the 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O, 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C and the skeletal density variations. Part of the noise (40%) could be due to the difficulty of sampling exactly time contemporaneous parts of each band along the two tracks and part of it could be due to genuine intraband variability. In spite of the intraband variability, the time series obtained from the two tracks are similar, indicating that the dominant causative factor for the isotopic variations is external, i.e., the environmental conditions that prevail during the growth of the coral; density band formation does not appear to be directly controlled by the sea surface temperature.</p>

						<li>𝛿<sup>13</sup>C variations are consistent with independent evidence that shows that during the last glacial maximum (LGM; 18 ka) the upwelling was reduced while during 9 ka it was vigorous;</li>
						<li>calculation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> flux shows that the LGM was characterized by low biogenic productivity in the Arabian Sea while during the Holocene productivity increased by ∼65%, as a direct consequence of the changes in upwelling. Similar changes (of lesser magnitude) are also seen in the equatorial Indian Ocean. The amount of terrigenous input into the Arabian Sea doubled during LGM possibly due to the higher erosion rate along the west coast;</li>
						<li>𝛿<sup>18</sup>O values indicate that the Arabian Sea was saltier by 1 to 2% during LGM. The northern part was dominated by evaporation while in the equatorial part there was an increased precipitation.</li>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ferromanganese crusts from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans record the Nd and Pb isotope compositions of the water masses from which they form as hydrogenous precipitates. The <sup>10</sup>Be/<sup>9</sup>Be-calibrated time series for crusts are compared to estimates based on Co-contents, from which the equatorial Pacific crusts studied are inferred to have recorded ca. 60 Ma of Pacific deep water history.</p>
					<p>Time series of 𝜀 Nd show that the oceans have maintained a strong provinciality in Nd isotopic composition, determined by terrigenous inputs, over periods of up to 60 Ma. Superimposed on the distinct basin-specific signatures are variations in Nd and Pb isotope time series which have been particularly marked over the last 5 Ma.</p>
					<p>It is shown that changes in erosional inputs, particularly associated with Himalayan uplift and the northern hemisphere glaciation have influenced Indian and Atlantic Ocean deep water isotopic composi- tions respectively. There is no evidence so far for an imprint of the final closure of the Panama Isthmus on the Pb and Nd isotopic composition in either Atlantic or Pacific deep water masses.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The radionuclide <sup>10</sup>Be (half-life 9 1:5 my), produced naturally in the Earth's atmosphere by nuclear interactions of cosmic rays, was sought in ocean sediments in the late fifties, considering its potential usefulness as a radiotracer for dating sediments. <sup>10</sup>Be was discovered independently by two groups, one in India and the other in the USA, and used only for dating marine sediments and manganese nodules until the seventies. Subsequently, as a result of a technical advance resulting in the improvement in the sensitivity of measurement of <sup>10</sup>Be by about a factor of 10<sup>6</sup>, there was a global rush to measure this nuclide in most materials participating in the physical, chemical and biological processes in the dynamic geosphere. This paper outlines the reasons for this ``isotope rush'', and the lessons learned from these studies. I also present my personal views of the special attractive features of this nuclide on the one hand, and on the other, the pitfalls or the wrong message this nuclide could convey!</p>

				<title>Sr isotopes in the Orgueil CI meteorite:  Chronology of early solar system hydrothermal  activity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0187-0193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New Sr isotopic analyses and calculated formation ages of carbonates from the Orgueil CI meteorite are reported. Among the samples analyzed in this work, dolomites give the youngest formation ages and may have been deposited intermittently starting near the time of parent body formation and continuing for at least 30 Ma. The Sr isotope data also suggest that breunnerites (Fe-Mn-Mg carbonates) crystallized after dolomite formation. Leaching experiments on bulk meteorite samples provide evidence for a very mobile, water soluble Sr reservoir in Orgueil that is characterized by extremely radiogenic Sr (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr $\approx 0.81- 0.82$). This unsupported Sr reflects recent element redistribution, possibly at the time of parent body breakup recorded by the ∼10 Ma exposure age of Orgueil. The carbonate data in particular corroborate earlier indications that hydrothermal processes were among the earliest events to affect the CI parent body.</p>

					<p>The notion of remote element synthesis has recently been modified to explain the presence of nucleogenetic isotopic anomalies and decay products of short-lived nuclides by injection of a small amount of exotic nucleogenetic material.

The activity during this period was marked by the development of a monsoon depression from 26th-29th October that weakened over the sea; onset of northeast monsoon along the east coast of India on 29th October; a low pressure area that formed on 2nd November over southwest Bay off Sri Lanka -southTamilnadu coast; and another cyclonic circulation that formed towards the end of the BOBMEX-Pilot period.

				<abstract>
					<p>Although India has a long experience in ship-borne experiments and oceanographic instrumentation, the atmospheric component has not received much attention in the past. In this paper, the basis of the atmospheric instrumentation system assembled for use on board ORV Sagar Kanya for the BOBMEX- Pilot experiment is described along with some representative results. Wherever possible, Woods Hole's IMET recommendations for meteorological sensors for applications in the marine environment have been followed to keep our measurements in par with international standards. The sensors were tested during the BOBMEX-Pilot experiment and all sensors worked well. Velocity, humidity and temperature data have been successfully collected using fast sensors. It is shown that the component due to the ship's pitching motion can be removed from the measured vertical velocity by making use of an accelerometer. This makes it possible to calculate the surface fluxes by direct methods.</p>

Surface meteorological data were acquired continuously through an automatic weather monitoring system and manually every three hours. High resolution radiosondes were launched to obtain the vertical thermal structure of the atmosphere. The study area was convectively active, the SSTs were high, surface air was warm and moist, and the surface air moist static energy was among the highest observed over the tropical oceans. The mean sea air temperature difference was about 1.25&#176;C and the sea skin temperature was cooler than bucket SST by 0.5&#176;C. The atmospheric mixed layer was shallow, fluctuated in response to synoptic conditions from 100 m to 900 m with a mean around 500 m.</p>

				<page>0239-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes measurement of air-sea parameters and estimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes by the ``Inertial-Dissipation'' technique over south Bay of Bengal. The data were collected on ORV Sagar Kanya during BOBMEX-Pilot cruise during the period 23rd October 1998 to 12th November 1998 over south Bay of Bengal. The fluxes are estimated using the data collected through fast response sensors namely Gill anemometer, Sonic anemometer and IR Hygrometer. In this paper the analyses carried out for two days, one relatively cloud free day on November 3rd and the other cloudy with rain on November 1st, are presented. Sea surface and air temperatures are higher on November 3rd than on November 1st. Sensible heat flux for both the days does not show any significant variation over the period of estimation, whereas latent heat flux is more for November 3rd than November 1st. An attempt is made to explain the variation of latent heat flux with a parameter called thermal stability on the vapor transfer from the water surface, which depends on wind speed and air to sea surface temperature difference.</p>

				<title>Thermohaline structure and circulation in the upper layers of the southern Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-Pilot (October &#8212; November 1998)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0255-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrographic data collected on board ORV Sagar Kanya in the southern Bay of Bengal during the BOBMEX-Pilot programme (October - November 1998) have been used to describe the thermohaline structure and circulation in the upper 200 m water column of the study region. The presence of seasonal Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the study area, typically characterized with enhanced cloudiness and flanked by the respective east/northeast winds on its northern part and west/southwest winds on its southern part, has led to net surface heat loss of about 55 W/m<sup>2</sup>. The sea surface dynamic topography relative to 500 db shows that the upper layer circulation is characterised by a cyclonic gyre encompassing the study area. The eastward flowing Indian Monsoon Current (IMC) between 5&#176; N and 7&#176; N in the south and its northward branching along 87&#176; E up to 13&#176; N appear to feed the cyclonic gyre. The Vessel-Mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VM-ADCP) measured currents confirm the presence of the cyclonic gyre in the southern Bay of Bengal during the withdrawing phase of the southwest monsoon from the northern/central parts of the Bay of Bengal.</p>

				<title>Diurnal variability of upper ocean temperature and heat budget in the southern Bay of Bengal during October &#8212; November, 1998 (BOBMEX-Pilot)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0267-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-series data on upper-ocean temperature, Vessel-Mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VM-ADCP) measured currents and surface meteorological parameters have been obtained for the first time in the southern Bay of Bengal at 7&#176; N, 10&#176; N, and 13&#176; N locations along 87&#176; E during October - November, 1998 under BOBMEX-Pilot programme. These data have been analysed to examine the diurnal variability of upper oceanic heat budget and to estimate the eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper layer. Diurnal variation of near-surface temperature is typical at northern location (13&#176;N) with a range of 0.5&#176;C while the diurnal range of temperature is enhanced to 0.8&#176;C at the central location (10&#176; N) due to intense solar radiation (1050 W/m<sub>2</sub>), clear skies and low wind speeds. At the southern location (7&#176;N), the diurnal variation of temperature is atypical with the minimum temperature occurring at 2000 hrs instead of at early morning hours. In general, the diurnal curve of temperature penetrated up to 15 to 20 m with decreasing diurnal range with depth. The VM-ADCP measured horizontal currents in the upper ocean were predominantly easterly/northeasterly at southern location, north/northerly at central location and northwesterly at northern location, thus describing a large-scale cyclonic gyre with the northward meridional flow along 87&#176;E. The magnitudes of heat loss at the surface due to air-sea heat exchanges and in the upper 50 m layer due to vertical diffusion of heat are highest at the southern location where intense convective activity followed by overcast skies and synoptic disturbance prevailed in the lower atmosphere. This and the estimated higher value (0.0235 m<sup>2</sup>/s) of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper ocean (0-50 m depth) suggest that 1-D processes controlled the upper layer heat budget at the southern location. On the other hand, during the fair weather conditions, at the central and northern locations, the upper layer gained heat energy, while the sea surface lost (gained) heat energy at northern (central) location. This and lower values of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat (0.0045 and 0.0150m<sup>2</sup>/s) and the northward intensification of horizontal currents at these locations suggest the greater role of horizontal heat advection over the 1-D processes in the upper ocean heat budget at these two locations.</p>

				<title>Controls of dimethyl sulphide in the Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-Pilot cruise 1998</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0279-0283</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The air-sea exchange is one of the main mechanisms maintaining the abundances of trace gases in the atmosphere. Some of these, such as carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulphide (DMS), will have a bearing on the atmospheric heat budget. While the former facilitates the trapping of radiation (greenhouse effect) the latter works in the opposite direction through reflectance of radiation back into space by sulphate aerosols that form from oxidation of DMS in atmosphere. Here we report on the first measurements made on DMS in the Bay of Bengal and the factors regulating its abundance in seawater. Phytoplankton alone does not seem to control the extent of DMS concentrations. We find that changes in salinity could effectively regulate the extent of DMSP production by marine phytoplankton. In addition, we provide the first ever evidence to the occurrence of DMS precursor, DMSP, in marine aerosols collected in the boundary layer. This suggests that the marine aerosol transport of DMSP will supplement DMS gaseous evasion in maintaining the atmospheric non-sea salt sulphur budget.</p>

				<page>0293-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt has been made to study the marine boundary layer characteristics over Bay of Bengal using BOBMEX (Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment) pilot experiment data sets, which was conducted between 23rd October and 12th November 1998 on board ORV Sagar Kanya. A one-dimensional multi- level atmospheric boundary layer with TKE-𝜀 closure scheme is employed to study the marine boundary layer characteristics. In this study two synoptic situations are chosen: one represents an active convection case and the other a suppressed convection. In the present article the marine boundary layer charac- teristics such as temporal evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, height of the boundary layer and the air- sea exchange processes such as sensible and latent heat fluxes, drag coefficient for momentum are simulated during both active and suppressed convection. Marine boundary layer height is estimated from the vertical profiles of potential temperature using the stability criterion. The model simulations are compared with the available observations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is based on the observed features of the MBL (Marine Boundary Layer) during the Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) - Pilot phase. Conserved Variable Analysis (CVA) of the conserved variables such as potential temperature, virtual potential temperature, equivalent potential temperature, saturation equivalent potential temperature and specific humidity were carried out at every point of upper air observation obtained on board ORV Sagar Kanya. The values are estimated up to a maximum of 4 km to cover the boundary layer. The Marine Boundary Layer Height is estimated from the conserved thermodynamic profiles. During the disturbed period when the convective activity is observed, the deeper boundary layers show double mixing line structures. An attempt is also made to study the oceanic heat budget using empirical models. The estimated short-wave radiation flux compared well with the observations.</p>

				<title>Ocean circulation in the tropical Indo-Pacific during early Pliocene (5.6 - 4.2 Ma):  Paleobiogeographic and isotopic evidence</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0315-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A Comparison of late Neogene planktic foraminferal biogeography and stable isotopic records of shallow dwelling and deep dwelling planktic foraminifera from DSDP sites 214 (Ninetyeast Ridge, northeast Indian Ocean) and 586B (ontong-Java Plateau, western Equatorial Pacific) provides a clue to the nature of the ocean circulation in the tropical Indo-Pacific during early Pliocene.</p>
					<p>The Present study reveals that the late Neogene planktic foraminiferal data from the eastern and western sides of the Indonesian Seaway are very similar. The only distinct inter-ocean difference however is the absence of Pulleniatina spectablis from the Indian Ocean. This species makes its first evolutionary appearance in the Equatorial Pacific at about 5.6 Ma (Early Gilbert reversed) and ranges up to 4.2 Ma (Top Conhiti subchron). The complete absence of Pulleniatina spectablis from the Indian Ocean is attributed to blocking of westward flow of tropical waters of the Pacific to the Indian Ocean resulting in a major change in the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans during 5.6 to 4.2 ma.</p>
					<p>In order to understand the nature of this blockage, isotopic depth ranking of selected planktic foraminifera and thus may be interpreted that the shallow sills that mark the Seaway in modern times were present as early as 5.6 Ma.</p>
					<p>The distribution of Pulleniatina spectablis throughout the Equatorial Pacific reveals that Modern Equatorial Pacific Under Current (Cromwell Current) flowing towards east at a depth of 200-300 m (which is also the depth habitat of  Pulleniatina spectablis) was present at the beginning of the Pliocene (5.6 Ma).</p>
					<p>As a dequel to the blocking of the Indonesian Seaway and the resultant interruption in the flow of central Equatorial Current System of the Pacific to the west there was an increase in the western Pacific Warm Pool Waters and strengthening of the gyral circulation in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This eventually triggered the intensification of the Asian Monsoon System.</p>

				<title>Response of an ocean general circulation model to wind and thermodynamic forcings</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0329-0337</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stretched-coordinate ocean general circulation model has been designed to study the observed variability due to wind and thermodynamic forcings. The model domain extends from 60&#176;N to 60&#176;S and cyclically continuous in the longitudinal direction. The horizontal resolution is 5&#176; &#215; 5&#176; and 9 discrete vertical levels. First a spin-up experiment has been done with ECMWF-AMIP 1979 January mean fields. The wind stress, ambient atmospheric temperature, evaporation and precipitation have been used in order to derive mechanical and thermodynamical surface forcings. Next, the experiment has been extended for another 30 years (3 cycles each of 10 year period) with varying surface boundary conditions (from January 1979 to December 1988 of ECMWF-AMIP monthly fields for each cycle) along with 120 years extended spin-up control run's results as initial conditions. The results presented here are for the last 10 years simulations. The preliminary results of this experiment show that the model is capable of simulating some of the general features and the pattern of interannual variability of the ocean.</p>

				<title>Precipitation reconstruction using ring-width chronology of Himalayan cedar from western Himalaya: Preliminary results</title>

				<page>0339-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara (D. Don) G. Don) due to its long age and wide ecological amplitude in the Himalayan region has strong dendroclimatic potential. A well replicated ring-width chronology of it, derived from the ensemble of tree-ring samples of two adjacent homogeneous sites, has been used to reconstruct precipitation for the non-monsoon months (previous year October to concurrent May) back to AD 1171. This provides the first record of hydrological conditions for the western Himalayan region, India during the whole of the `Little Ice Age' and latter part of the `Medieval Warm Period'. The reconstruction revealed the wettest and the driest non-monsoon months during the fourteenth and the thirteenth centuries, respectively. The seventeenth century consistently recorded dry non-monsoon months in the western Himalayan region. Surplus precipitation, especially more pronounced since the 1950s, is recorded in the current century.</p>

				<title>Diverse signatures of deformation, pressure-temperature and anatexis in the Rayagada sector of the Eastern Ghats granulite terrane</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0347-0369</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The granulites and granitoids around Rayagada in the north central part of the Eastern Ghats belt display structural and petrological differences when compared to similar rocks from Chilka and Jenapore in the northern Eastern Ghats. The impress of F<sub>1</sub> deformation is almost erased while that of F<sub>3</sub> is muted. The metapelites have a restricted chemical range and are non-migmatitic. There are two varieties of leptynitic granitoids, one of which is interlayered with yet another S-type granite containing cordierite. The maximum recorded temperature from geothermometers is 780&#176;C, but the magnitude of pressure is comparatively low, the highest value being 6.3 kbar. Another distinctive feature of the pressure- temperature record is the absence of evidence of decompression in the lower realms of pressure and temperature. Metamorphic reactions that could be identified indicate cooling, a noteworthy reaction being the sillimanite to andalusite transformation. Integration of data from pressure-temperature sensors suggest cooling at two pressures, 6 and 5 kbar. The generation of two types of granitoids from metapelites is interpreted to be due to intersection with solidus curves for pelitic and graywacke-like compositions, constrained by recent experiments, at 6 and 5 kbar. The first melting occurred on a prograde path while the second one was due to increase in temperature during exhumation at tectonic rates.</p>
					<p>Thus inspite of a broad similarity in the geodynamic scenario across the northern part of the Eastern Ghat belt, differences in exhumation rates and in style of melting were responsible for producing different signatures in the Rayagada granulite terrane.</p>

					<p>A plain strain problem of an isotropic elastic liquid-saturated porous medium in poroelasticity has been studied. The eigenvalue approach using the Laplace and Fourier transforms has been employed and these transforms have been inverted by using a numerical technique. An application of infinite space with concentrated force at the origin has been presented to illustrate the utility of the approach. The displacement and stress components in the physical domain are obtained numerically. The results are shown graphically and can be used for a broad class of problems related to liquid-saturated porous media.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The degree sheet Aeromagnetic maps up to 17&#176;N, acquired from the Geological Survey of India, have been manually redigitised at 6 minute intervals to study the long wavelength anomalies over peninsular India. These data have been collected at different survey altitude, epochs, flight line directions, etc. Great care has been taken to correct the total field map and remove the contribution due to the core field and prepare an accurate crustal anomaly map. For the first time, a regional map, depicting the NW-SE structural features north of the orthopyroxene isograd with the essentially E-W features to the south of it and revealing several well known structures, is presented. The analytical signal is calculated to delineate the source fields of these anomalies. It dramatically maps the charnockites and is able to delineate the orthopyroxene isograd. In the Dharwar region the magnetic signatures are associated with the intrusives/ iron ore bodies. Thus, we find that the source rocks of the aeromagnetic anomalies are the host province of charnockites in the SGT and the intrusives/iron ore bodies in the Dharwar belt.

				<title>Analysis of pathfinder SST algorithm for global and regional conditions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0395-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As part of the Pathfinder program developed jointly by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a large database of in situ sea surface temperature (SST) measurements coincident with satellite data is now available to the user community. The Pathfinder Matchup Database (PMDB) is a multi-year, multi-satellite collection of coincident measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and broadly distributed buoy data (matchups). This database allows the user community to test and validate new SST algorithms to improve the present accuracy of surface temperature measurements from satellites. In this paper we investigate the performance of a global Pathfinder algorithm to specific regional conditions. It is shown that for zenith angles less than 45&#176;, the best-expected statistical discrepancy between satellite and buoy data is about $∼0.5 $ K. In general, the bias of the residuals (satellite - buoy) is negative in most regions, except in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas, where the residuals are always positive. A seasonal signal in SST residuals is observed in all regions and is strongest in the Indian Ocean. The channel-difference term used as a proxy for atmospheric water vapor correction is observed to be unresponsive for columnar water vapor values greater than 45 mm and high zenith angles. This unresponsiveness of the channels leads to underestimation of sea surface temperature from satellites in these conditions.</p>

				<title>Radiative Transfer Code: Application to the calculation of PAR</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0407-0413</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The production of carbon in the ocean, the so-called primary production, depends on various physico- biological parameters: the biomass and nutrient amounts in oceans, the salinity and temperature of the water and the light available in the water column. We focus on the visible spectrum of the solar radiation defined as the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). We developed a model (Chami et al. 1997) to simulate the behavior of the solar beam in the atmosphere and the ocean. We first describe the theoretical basis of the code and the method we used to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE): the successive orders of scattering (SO). The second part deals with a sensitivity study of the PAR just above and below the sea surface for various atmospheric conditions. In a cloudy sky, we computed a ratio between vector fluxes just above the sea surface and spherical fluxes just beneath the sea surface. When the optical thickness of the cloud increases this ratio remains constant and around 1.29. This parameter is convenient to convert vector flux at the sea surface as retrieved from satellite to PAR. Subsequently, we show how solar radiation as vector flux rather than PAR leads to an underestimate of the primary production up to 40% for extreme cases.</p>

				<title>Bio-optical properties of gelbstoff in the Arabian Sea at the onset of southwest monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0415-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As part of the German JGOFS Indian Ocean Programme, a cruise occurred in the Arabian Sea in May 1997 at the onset of the southwest monsoon. Data on gelbstoff, chlorophyll 𝑎 and tryptophan-like fluorescence as well as gelbstoff absorption were obtained. They indicate, that these optical parameters support the interpretation of hydrographic and biogeochemical conditions. Tryptophan-like fluorescence seems to be a useful indicator of changes in the constitution of the biomass.</p>
					<p>A comparison of gelbstoff absorption and fluorescence data from the upper 100 m reveals only a weak covariance. Special emphasis is given to the fit procedure used for retrieving the exponential slope 𝑆 of the spectral absorption coefficient. 𝑆 values with a mean of 0.016 nm<sup>-1</sup> are found in the 350 to 480 nm wavelength range. A mean slope 𝑆 set to the frequently reported value of 0.014 nm<sup>-1</sup> in the exponential description of gelbstoff absorption might lead to a systematic over/underestimation, and thus to systematic errors, if single-wavelength absorption values are extrapolated to other spectral regions on the basis of this parameter.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0427-0432</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Remotely sensed data on ocean colour of waters surrounding Sri Lanka received from the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) are processed and analyzed. Raw data of 1 km resolution on relatively cloud free days during 1978-1986 are processed to produce sea surface chlorophyll maps within latitudes 4.5N-11N and longitudes 78E-85E, a region in the Indian Ocean surrounding Sri Lanka. The processed data include about 110 single day maps and composite averages for each month and season. The months of July, August and September are omitted in the calculation of averages due to insufficient data. The waters in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay areas show high chlorophyll-a concentrations throughout the year. However, these high  values may represent other suspended particles and dissolved organic matter besides chlorophyll-a as this region is shallow (&lt; 100 m). Regions with high chlorophyll concentrations (&gt;0:5 mg m<sup>-3</sup>) along the coast and western ocean region can be seen in the months of October and November, after the southwest monsoon period. As high surface chlorophyll concentrations may indicate high productivity, these regions need extensive measurements of primary production and also continuous monitoring of fish catches, during and after the southwest monsoon. Studies of particle composition in shallow water areas, in particular waters in Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar, should be carried out in order to elucidate the effect of non-phytogenic.</p>

				<title>Physical control of primary productivity on a seasonal scale in the central and eastern Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0433-0441</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using <i>in situ</i> data collected during 1992$-$1997, under the Indian programme of Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), we show that the biological productivity of the Arabian Sea is tightly coupled to the physical forcing mediated through nutrient availability. The Arabian Sea becomes productive in summer not only along the coastal regions of Somalia, Arabia and southern parts of the west coast of India due to coastal upwelling but also in the open waters of the central region. The open waters in the north are fertilized by a combination of divergence driven by cyclonic wind stress curl to the north of the Findlater Jet and lateral advection of nutrient-rich upwelled waters from Arabia. Productivity in the southern part of the central Arabian Sea, on the other hand, is driven by advection from the Somalia upwelling. Surface cooling and convection resulting from reduced solar radiation and increased evaporation make the northern region productive in winter. During both spring and fall inter-monsoons, this sea remains warm and stratified with low production as surface waters are oligotrophic. Inter-annual variability in physical forcing during winter resulted in one-and-a-half times higher production in 1997 than in 1995.</p>

				<title>Abundance and relationship of bacteria with transparent exopolymer particles during the 1996 summer monsoon in the Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0443-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bacterial abundance and production, numbers, sizes and concentrations of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were measured during the 1996 summer monsoon to understand the relationship between TEP, the most labile particulate organic carbon, and bacteria. While high regional variability in the vertical distribution of TOC was discernible, TEP concentrations  were high in surface waters at 18-20&#176;N along 64&#176;E with concentrations well over 25 mg alginic acid equivalents $1^{-1}$ due to upwelling induced productivity. Their concentrations decreased with depth and were lower between 200 and 500 m. Bacterial concentrations were up to 1.99 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> 1<sup>-1</sup> in the surface waters and decreased by an order of magnitude or more at depths below 500 m. A better relationship has been found between bacterial abundance and concentrations of TEP than between bacteria and TOC, indicating that bacterial metabolism is fueled by availability of TEP in the Arabian Sea. Assuming a carbon assimilation of 33%, bacterial carbon demand (BCD) is estimated to be 1.017 to 4.035 g C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in the surface waters. The observed TEP concentrations appear to be sufficient in meeting the surface and  subsurface BCD in the northern Arabian Sea.</p>

				<title>A vertically resolved model for phytoplankton aggregation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0453-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work presents models of the vertical distribution and flux of phytoplankton aggregates, including changes with time in the distribution of aggregate sizes and sinking speeds. The distribution of sizes is described by two parameters, the mass and number of aggregates, which greatly reduces the computational cost of the models. Simple experiments demonstrate the effects of aggregation on the timing and depth distribution of primary production and export. A more detailed ecological model is applied to sites in the Arabian Sea; it demonstrates that aggregation can be important for deep sedimentation even when its effect on surface concentrations is small, and it presents the difference in timing between settlement of aggregates and fecal pellets.</p>

				<title>Seasonal controls on surface pCO<sub>2</sub> in the central and eastern Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0471-0479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variability in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>) and its control by biological and physical processes in the mixed layer (ML) of the central and eastern Arabian Sea during inter-monsoon, northeast monsoon, and southwest monsoon seasons were studied. The ML varied from 80-120 m during NE monsoon, 60-80 m and 20-30 m during SW- and inter-monsoon seasons, respectively, and the variability resulted from different physical processes. Significant seasonal variability was found in pCO<sub>2</sub> levels. During SW monsoon, coastal waters contain two contrasting regimes; (a) pCO<sub>2</sub> levels of 520-685 𝜇atm were observed in the SW coast of India, the highest found so far from this region, driven by intense upwelling and (b) low levels of pCO<sub>2</sub> (266 𝜇 atm) were found associated with monsoonal fresh water influx. It varied in ranges of 416-527 𝜇atm and 375-446 𝜇atm during inter- and NE monsoon, respectively, in coastal waters with higher values occurring in the north. The central Arabian Sea pCO<sub>2</sub> levels were 351-433, 379-475 and 385-432 𝜇atm during NE- inter and SW monsoon seasons, respectively. The mixed layer pCO<sub>2</sub> relations with temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll 𝑎 and primary production revealed that the former is largely regulated by physical processes during SW- and NE monsoon whereas both physical and biological processes are important in inter-monsoon. Application of Louanchi <i>et al</i> (1996) model revealed that the mixing effect is the dominant during monsoons, however, the biological effect is equally significant during SW monsoon whereas thermodynamics and fluxes influence during inter-monsoons.</p>

				<title>350 ka organic 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C record of the monsoon variability on the Oman continental margin, ArabianSea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0481-0489</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stable isotope compositions of sedimentary organic carbon and content of organic carbon for sediment cores recovered at two sites (sites 724C and 725C) during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg. 117 on the Oman continental margin are used to document variability of the monsoon winds for the past 350 ka. Although both sites have a mean 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C value of -20.1%, three zones depleted in <sup>13</sup>C are observable at site 724C during isotope stages 3, 8 and 10, while only one zone is recognizable at site 725C. Increased coastal upwelling during isotope stage 3 owing to intense SW monsoon winds resulted in higher concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the water column causing the formation of organic matter that was depleted in <sup>13</sup>C. The other two zones deposited during oxygen isotope stages 8 and 10, which are also characterized by low values of organic carbon, nitrogen and C/N ratios, could be attributed to the dilution by terrestrial material derived from paleosol by transported by northwesterlies. Because of utilization of <sup>13</sup>C enriched dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> during the last glacial maximum Holocene sedimentary organic materials are depleted in <sup>13</sup>C relative to the the fomer. The content of residues organic carbon (ROC) is higher at site 724C (with an average of 2.3 ± 1.2%) relative to site 725C, which averages to 0.9 ± 0.4% probably because of differences in the degree of preservation. Organic material deposited at site 725C has undergone more degradation relative to site 724C as reflected by a systematic downcore decrease in <sup>13</sup>C resulting from a loss of <sup>13</sup>C enriched organic compounds. Owing to lack of good chronology at site 725C, a zone that is characterized by low 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C values it could not be correlated with the other three zones observed at Site 724C.</p>

This paper presents the development and application of a data assimilation procedure based on optimal control theory. The aim of the procedure is to identify a set of model coefficient values that ensures the best fit between data and model results by minimizing a function that measures model and data discrepancies. In this sense, twin experiments have been successfully implemented in order to have a better estimation of biological model parameters and biological initial conditions.</p>

				<title>A coupled physical-biological-chemical model for the Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0503-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A coupled physical-biological-chemical model has been developed at C-MMACS. for studying the time- variation of primary productivity and air-sea carbon-dioxide exchange in the Indian Ocean. The physical model is based on the Modular Ocean Model, Version 2 (MOM2) and the biological model describes the nonlinear dynamics of a 7-component marine ecosystem. The chemical model includes dynamical equation for the evolution of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. The interaction between the biological and chemical model is through the Redfield ratio. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide pCO<sub>2</sub> of the surface layer is obtained from the chemical equilibrium equations of Peng <i>et al</i> 1987. Transfer coefficients for air-sea exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> are computed dynamically based on the wind speeds. The coupled model reproduces the high productivity observed in the Arabian Sea off the Somali and Omani coasts during the Southwest (SW) monsoon. The entire Arabian Sea is an outgassing region for CO<sub>2</sub>   in spite of high productivity with transfer rates as high as 80 m-mol C/m<sup>2</sup>/day during SW monsoon near the Somali Coast on account of strong winds.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0001-0008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The temperature field within the crust is closely related to tectonic history as well as many othergeological processes inside the earth. Therefore, knowledge of the crustal thermal structure of a region is of great importance for its tectonophysical studies. This work deals with the two-dimensional thermal modelling to delineate the crustal thermal structure along a 230 km long Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profile in the north Cambay basin. In this work P-wave velocities obtained from the DSS studies have been converted into heat generation values for the computation of temperature distribution. The model result reveals the Curie isotherm at a depth of ≈ 22 km and Moho temperature at around 900&#176;C.</p>

				<title>Earthquake source model using strong motion displacement as response of finite elastic media</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0009-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The strong motion displacement records available during an earthquake can be treated as the response of the earth as the a structural system to unknown forces acting at unknown locations. Thus, if the part of the earth participating in ground motion is modelled as a known finite elastic medium, one can attempt to model the source location and forces generated during an earthquake as an inverse problem in structural dynamics. Based on this analogy, a simple model for the basic earthquake source is proposed. The unknown source is assumed to be a sequence of impulses acting at locations yet to be found. These unknown impulses and their locations are found using the normal mode expansion along with a minimization of mean square error. The medium is assumed to be finite, elastic, homogeneous, layered and horizontal with a specific set of boundary conditions. Detailed results are obtained for Uttarkashi earthquake. The impulse locations exhibit a linear structure closely associated with the causative fault. The results obtained are shown to be in good agreement with reported values. The proposed engineering model is then used to simulate the acceleration time histories at a few recording stations. The earthquake source in terms of a sequence of impulses acting at different locations is applied on a 2D finite elastic medium and acceleration time histories are found using finite element methods. The synthetic accelerations obtained are in close match with the recorded accelerations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Detailed gravity data collected across the Gadwal schist belt in the state of Andhra Pradesh show an  8.4 mgal residual gravity anomaly associated with meta-sediments/volcanics of the linear NNW-SSE trending schist belt that shows metamorphism from green schist to amphibolite facies. This schist belt is flanked on either side by the peninsular gneissic complex. The elevation and slab Bouguer corrected residual gravity profile data were interpreted using 2-D prism models. The results indicate a synformal structure having a width of 1.8 km at the surface, tapering at a depth of about 2.6 km with a positive density contrast of 0.15 gm/cc with respect to the surrounding peninsular gneissic complex.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry of sericite deposits at the base of the Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup, Rajasthan, India: Evidence for metamorphosed and metasomatised Precambrian Paleosol</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0039-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fine grained sericite deposits occur at the interface between Archean Mewar Gneiss Complex and the Proterozoic Aravalli Supergroup independent of shearing. They show a gradational contact with the basement granites and gneisses and a sharp contact with the overlying quartz pebble conglomeratic quartzites. Rip-up clasts of these sericite schists are found in the overlying conglomerates. The sericite schists are rich in sericite towards the top and contain chlorite towards the base. The sericite in these schists was formed by metasomatic alteration of kyanite and not from the feldspars of the basement granitoids and gneisses. Uni-directional variations of SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, high Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> content (&gt;30%), positive correlation between Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> , Ti/Al and Ti/Zr ratios, high pre-metasomatic chemical  indices of alteration (&gt;90), and enrichment of heavy rare earth elements relative to the parent granites and gneisses &#8212; all these chemical characteristics combined with field evidence suggest that the sericite schists are formed from a paleosol protolith, which developed on Archean basement between 2.5 and ∼2.1 Ga in the Precambrian of Rajasthan. The superimposed metasomatic alteration restricts the use of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Ti and Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Ti ratios of these paleosols for interpretation of PO<sub>2</sub> conditions in the atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Are Majhgawan-Hinota pipe rocks truly group-I kimberlite?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The diamond bearing pipe rocks in Majhgawan–Hinota (more than four pipes) occur as intrusives in sandstones of Kaimur Group. These Proterozoic (974 ± 30–1170 ± 20 Ma) intrusive rocks, occupying the southeastern margin of Aravalli craton, were called as `micaceous kimberlite' in tune with the reported kimberlite occurrences from other parts of the world. Judging from the definition of kimberlite, as approved by the IUGS Subcommission on Systematics of Igneous Rocks, it is not justified to call these rocks as `micaceous kimberlite'. Rather the mineralogical assemblages such as absence of typomorphic mineral monticellite (primary), abundance of phlogopite cognate, frequent presence of barite and primary carbonate mostly as calcite coupled with ultrapotassic and volatile-rich (dominantly H<sub>2</sub>O) nature and high concentration of incompatible elements (such as Ba, Zr, Th, U), low Th/U ratios, low REE and no Eu-anomaly clearly indicate a close similarity with that of South African orangeites. Thus orangeites of Proterozoic age occur outside the Kaapvaal craton of South Africa which are much younger (200 Ma to 110 Ma) in age.</p>

				<title>Retrieval of vertical wind profiles during monsoon from satellite observed winds over the Indian Ocean using complex EOF analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0077-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of deriving vertical wind profiles from current satellite observations. With this aim, we carried out complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis of a large number of radiosonde observations of wind profiles over the Indian Ocean during the monsoon months. It has been found that the first two CEOFs explain 67% of the total variance in wind fields. While the first principal component is well correlated with the winds at 850 mb ($r= 0.80$), the second one is highly correlated with winds at 200 mb ($r= 0.89$). This analysis formed the basis of a retrieval algorithm which ensures the retrieval of vertical profiles of winds using satellite tracked cloud motion vector winds. Under the assumption that accurate measurements of wind are available at the above mentioned levels, the r.m.s. error of retrieval of each component of wind is estimated to range between 2ms<sup>-1</sup> and 6ms<sup>-1</sup> at different levels, which is much less than the natural variance of winds at these levels. For a better visualization of retrieval, we have provided retrieved and true wind profiles side by side for four typical synoptic conditions during the monsoon season.</p>

				<title>Occurrence of heavy rainfall around the confluence line in monsoon disturbances and its importance in causing floods</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0087-0094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known that heavy rainfall occurs in the southwestern sector of the monsoon depressions due to strong convergence in that sector. By examining the rainfall distribution associated with the monsoon disturbances (lows and depressions) in one of the central Indian river basins, `Godavari', the author found that when the disturbance-centre is away from the basin, heavy rainfall may also occur in the basin area close to the confluence line and cause severe floods in the river. The confluence line is the zone of convergence between the northeasterlies to the west of the disturbance centre and the monsoon westerlies. This study further reveals the importance of the position and movement of the confluence line with respect to the basin, on which the intensity and the raising period of the resulting flood depend.</p>

				<title>Marine  biogeochemistries of Be and Al:  A study based on cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be, Be and Al in marine calcite, aragonite, and opal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0095-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geochemical behaviors of Be and Al in ocean waters have been successfully studied in recent years using natural, cosmogenic, radioactive <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al as tracers. The present day dissolved concentrations and distribution of the stable and radioactive isotopes of Be and Al in ocean waters have revealed their short residence times and appreciable effects of exchange uxes at the coastal and ocean-sediment interfaces. It follows that concentrations of these particle-active elements must have varied in the past with temporal changes in climate, biological productivity and aeolian ux of continental detritus to the oceans. We therefore investigated the feasibility of extending the measurements of Be and Al isotope concentrations in marine systems to the $10^3-10^6 y$ BP time scale. We report here the discovery of significant amounts of intrinsic Be and Al in marine foraminiferal calcite and coral aragonite, and of Al in opal (radiolarians) and aragonite (coral), which makes it possible to determine <sup>10</sup>Be/Be and <sup>26</sup>Al/Al in oceans in the past. We also report measured <sup>10</sup>Be/<sup>9</sup>Be in foraminiferal calcite in Pacific Ocean cores, which reveal that the concentrations and ratios of the stable and cosmogenic isotopes of Be and Al have varied significantly in the past 30 ky. The implications of these results are discussed.</p>

				<title>High Iridium concentration of alkaline rocks of Deccan and implications to K/T boundary</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0103-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here an unusually high concentration of iridium in some alkali basalts and alkaline rocks of Deccan region having an age of about 65Ma, similar to the age of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The alkali basalts of Anjar, in the western periphery of Deccan province, have irid-ium concentration as high as 178pg/g whereas the alkaline rocks and basalts associated with the Amba Dongar carbonatite complex have concentrations ranging between 8 and 80 pg/g. Some of these values are more than an order of magnitude higher than the concentration in the tholeiiticbasalts of Deccan, indicating the significance of alkaline magmatism in the iridium inventory at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Despite higher concentration, their contribution to the global inventory of iridium in the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary clays remains small. The concentration of iridium in uorites from Amba Dongar was found to be &lt; 30 pg/g indicating that iridium is not incorporated during their formation in hydrothermal activity.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry and magnetostratigraphy of Deccan flows at Anjar, Kutch</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0111-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chemical analysis of nine Deccan flow basalts at Anjar, Kutch, western India, indicates that all,except the uppermost flow F-9, are alkaline. In their major and trace element composition, the alkali basalts resemble Ocean island basalts (OIB). Similarities of many diagnostic trace element ratios (e.g. Sm/Nd, Ba/Nb,Y/Nb and Zr/Nb) are similar to those found in the Réunion Island basalts. The uppermost basalt is tholeiitic and chemically resembles the least contaminated Deccan basalt (Ambenali type). The Anjar basalts have iridium concentration ranging between 2 and 178 pg/g. Some of these values are higher by about an order of magnitude compared to the Ir concentration in other basalts of the Deccan. A synthesis of chemical, palaeomagnetic and geochronologic data enables us to construct a chemical and magnetic stratigraphy for these flows.</p>
					<p>The three flows below the iridium enriched intertrappean bed (IT III) show normal magnetic polarity whereas all except one of the upper basalts show reversed magnetic polarity. The sequence seems to have started in polarity zones 31N and probably continued up to 28R or 27R. The results presented here support the view that Deccan volcanism in Kutch occurred on a time span of a few million years.</p>

					<p>The paper describes the variation pattern of magnetic susceptibility of Lameta sediments and isotopic variation of organic <sup>13</sup>C from Chui Hill, Bergi, Kholdoda, Pisdura and Girad. The susceptibility pattern and a negative carbon isotopic anomaly allows fixation of the K/T boundary at these localities and they dier in these aspects from the inter-trappean sediments at Anjar.</p>

					<p>The clay layers at Anjar, associated closely with Ir-enrichments, are strongly leached, rhyolitic bentonites containing low-quartz paramorphs after high-quartz with glass inclusions.</p>
					<p>It is concluded, that the inter-trappean lake deposits at Anjar were deposited in the early part of magnetochron 29R and are unrelated to the K/T boundary.</p>

				<title>REE geochemistry of ore zones in the Archean auriferous schist belts of the eastern Dharwar craton, south India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0143-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The eastern Dharwar Craton of southern India includes at least three $∼2700Ma$ supracrustal belts (schist belts) which have mesothermal, quartz-carbonate vein gold mineralization emplaced within the sheared metabasalts. In the Hutti and the Kolar schist belts, the host rocks are amphibolites and the ore veins have been anked by only a thin zone of biotitic alteration; in the Ramagiri belt, however, the host rocks to the veins have been a ected by more extensive but lower temperature alteration by uids. The rare earth element (REE) geochemistry of the host metabasalts, alteration zones, ore veins and the bulk sulfides separated from the ore veins and the alteration zones suggest that</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the REE chemistry of the immediate host rocks has been modified by uids which added LREE,</li>
						<li>the REE abundance of the ore veins vary with the amount of host rock fragments included in the veins,</li>
						<li>the sulfides formed during mineralization have significant REE concentration with patterns nearly identical to the ore veins and alteration zones and</li>
						<li>therefore the ore uids involved in gold mineralization here could be LREE enriched.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Because alteration and mineralization involved addition of REE, more LREE compared to HREE, the uids could be of higher temperature origin. The initial Nd isotope ratios in the host rocks (𝜀 Nd calculated at 2700 Ma) showed a large variation (+8 to $-$4) and a deep crustal source for the uid REE seems likely. A crustal source for Pb and Os in the ore samples of Kolar belt has previously been suggested (Krogstad <i>et al</i> 1995; Walker <i>et al</i> 1989). Such a source for ore uids is consistent with a late Archean (2500Ma) accretionary origin for the terrains of the eastern Dharwar Craton.</p>

				<title>Extreme heterogeneity in Sr isotope systematic in the Himalayan leucogranites: A possible mechanism of partial melting based on thermal modeling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0161-0169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The small leucogranite plutons occurring in linear belts in the Higher Himalayas have formed due to post-collision partial melting within the Himalayan crust. Several studies have documented that the Sr isotopic ratios in the granite bodies show chaotic variation and meaningful Rb-Sr isochron ages are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. In tectonically overthickened crust, the depth-temperature profile (geotherm) remains strongly transient for the first tens of millions of years. It is proposed here that the intersecting relations between the transient geotherms and activity-dependent solidus/melting curves may generate small pods of magma at di erent depths and at di erent times. Each of these pods will have its unique Sr isotopic ratios. Coalescence of   these small pods of magma without any e ective homogenization due to deformation-induced fast segregation, ascent and emplacement may lead to pluton-wide extreme heterogeneity in Sr isotopic ratios.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><sup>40</sup>Ar$-$<sup>39</sup>Ar analyses of one alkali pyroxenite whole rock and two phlogopite separates of calcite carbonatites from the Sung Valley carbonatite-alkaline complex, which is believed to be a part of the Rajmahal-Bengal-Sylhet (RBS) ood basalt province, yielded indistinguishable plateau ages of 108.8 ± 2.0 Ma, 106:4 ± 1.3 Ma and 107.5 ± 1.4 Ma, respectively. The weighted mean of these ages, 107.2 ± 0.8 Ma, is the time of emplacement of this complex.

				<title>Development of micro-scale joints in volcanic rocks under thermal stress</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0191-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Petrographic studies of samples of the Rajmahal basalt reveal a variety of microscopic joints within phenocrysts, which seem to have developed under the in uence of thermal stresses during cooling. The theoretical analysis shows that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>thermal stresses develop in a system only under unsteady state of cooling,</li>
						<li>the stresses responsible for the development of joints are tensile in nature, and</li>
						<li>the magnitude of stresses increases with increasing rates of cooling.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In order to understand the effects of cooling rate on the mode of jointing, analogue model experiments were performed by quenching melt films of organic, crystalline materials under varying cooling conditions. In experiments, non-branching linear joints developed at relatively lower rates of cooling by a process of sub-critical crack propagation. On the other hand, at higher rates of cooling the mechanism of crack propagation was essentially supercritical leading to the development of branching joints.</p>

				<title>Scattering of a spherical pulse from a small inhomogeneity: Dilation and rotation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0205-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Perturbations in elastic constants and density distinguish a volume inhomogeneity from its homogeneous surroundings. The equation of motion for the first order scattering is studied in the perturbed medium. The scattered waves are generated by the interaction between the primary waves and the inhomogeneity. First order scattering theory is modified to include the source term generating the primary waves. The body force equivalent to the scattering source is presented in a convenient form involving the perturbations in wave velocities and gradient of density perturbation.</p>
					<p>A procedure is presented to study the scattering of a spherical pulse from a small inhomogeneity, in time domain. The size of inhomogeneity is assumed small as compared to its distance from source and receiver. No restrictions are placed on the positions of source, receiver and inhomogeneity. The dilatation and rotations are calculated for a pulse scattered from an arbitrary point in a spherical volume. The aggregate of the scattered phases from all the points of the inhomogeneity, reaching at a fixed receiver, gives the amount of scattering from the inhomogeneity. The interaction of both P and S waves with inhomogeneity are considered. Dilatation and rotations for scattering are obtained as integral expressions over the solid angle of inhomogeneity. These expressions are computed numerically, for hypothetical models. The effects of source (unit force) orientations, velocity and density perturbations, and size of inhomogeneity, on the scattered phases, are discussed.</p>

					<p>Recent algorithms for Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (DMSP-SSM/I) satellite data are used for estimating integrated water vapour over the Indian seas. Integrated water vapour obtained from these algorithms is compared with that derived from radiosonde observations at Minicoy and Port Blair islands. Algorithm-3 of Schlussel and Emery (1990) performed best.

				<title>Estimation of surface latent heat fluxes from IRS-P4/MSMR satellite data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0231-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The brightness temperatures of the Microwave sensor MSMR (Multichannel Scanning Microwave Radiometer) launched in May 1999 onboard Indian Oceansat-1 IRS-P4 are used to develop a direct retrieval method for latent heat ux by multivariate regression technique. The MSMR measures the microwave radiances at 8 channels at frequencies of 6.6, 10.7, 18 and 21 GHz at both vertical and horizontal polarizations. It is found that the surface LHF (Latent Heat Flux) is sensitive to all the channels. The coeficients were derived using the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data of three months: July, September, November of 1999. The NCEP daily analyzed latent heat uxes and brightness temperatures observed by MSMR were used to derive the coeficients. Validity of the derived coeficients was checked with <i>in situ</i> observations over the Indian Ocean and with NCEP analyzed LHF for global points. The LHF derived directly from the MSMR brightness temperature (Tb) yielded an accuracy of 35 watt/m<sup>2</sup>. LHF was also computed by applying bulk formula using the geophysical parameters extracted from MSMR. In this case the errors were higher apparently due to the errors involved in derivation of the geophysical parameters.</p>

				<title>Influence of micrometeorological features on coastal boundary layer aerosol characteristics at the tropical station, Trivandrum</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0247-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characteristics of aerosols in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) obtained from a bistatic CW lidar at Trivandrum for the last one decade are used to investigate the role of ABL micro- meteorological processes in controlling the altitude distribution and size spectrum. The altitude structure of number density shows three distinct zones depending on the prevailing boundary layer feature; viz, the well-mixed region, entertainment region and upper mixing region. In the lower altitudes vertical mixing is very strong (the well-mixed region) the upper limit of which is defined as aerosol-mixing height, is closely associated with the low level inversion. The aerosol mixing height generally lies in the range 150 to 400 m showing a strong dependence on the vertical eddy mixing processes in ABL. Above this altitude, the number density decreases almost exponentially with increase in altitude with a scale height of 0.5 -1.5 km. The aerosol mixing height is closely associated with the height of the Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL). Sea-spray aerosols generated as a result of the interaction of surface wind with sea surface forms an important component of mixing  region aerosols at this location. This component shows a non-linear dependence on wind speed. On an average, depending on the season, the mixing region contributes about 10-30% of the columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 0.5 𝜇 m wavelength. A long term increasing trend (∼ 2.8% per year) is observed in mixing region AOD from 1989 to 1997. A study on the development of the aerosols in the nocturnal mixing region shows that the convectively driven daytime altitude structure continues to persist for about 4-5 hrs. after the sunset and thereafter the altitude structure is governed by vertical structure of horizontal wind. Stratified aerosol layers associated with stratified turbulence is very common during the late night hours.</p>

				<title>Earth support systems: Threatened? Why? What can we do?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0269-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The most important concept to emerge in the 20th century was the recognition that sustainability is threatened. A sustainable society is one that functions and lives in such harmony with earth systems that future generations will be able to function with equal or greater ease and the quality of life will in no way be diminished.</p>
					<p>Evidence of threats to sustainability is found in: global energy use; global climate change; availability of sufficient safe water; degradation of soil on agricultural lands; food production for a global population of 9,000 million by 2050; accelerated extinction rates and loss of biodiversity; human under- and over-nourishment; and the spread of diseases.</p>
					<p>Ignorance borne of alienation from nature deprives us of sensitivity to the threats human activities cause. Alienation may be traced to the agricultural revolution, but has become widespread and even inescapable for many with massive control of energy and the industrial revolution, dependence on machines, and urbanization. With the control of enough energy to dominate nature and the achievement of a high, but transient, level of wealth, a world view extolling growth - led by the highly industrialized nations, but now being emulated in the developing countries - has committed the world to an unsustainable path.</p>
					<p>Because of this, world societies must work to find practical "sustainability" world views to help guide our future choices. Wise choices will depend upon good scientiffic understanding and must be based upon a deep respect for the non-human world and a concern for the future. The environmental meaning of different world views, whether founded in the world religions or in non-religious philosophy, share a common concern to promote an equitable, harmonious, and sustainable relationship between humanity and nature. The similarities in pragmatic meaning in relation to nature of, e.g., Christian stewardship and Deep Ecology, illustrate this.</p>
					<p>Our attention must not be directed towards alternative symbolic or linguistic vocabularies, but toward the practical environmental commitments that different world views entail. Our problems have global reach and many of them are urgent, but they are not intrinsically unsolvable. We must seek ways to find and use common ground in the search for sustainability. We must work together, but remember that each of us contributes to the final outcome.</p>

					<p>Metavolcanic rocks containing low-Ca amphiboles (gedrite, cummingtonite) and biotite can undergo substantial dehydration-melting. This is likely to be most prominent in Barrovian Facies Series (kyanite-sillimanite) and occurs at the same time as widespread metapelite dehydration- melting. In lower pressure facies series, metavolcanics will be represented by granulites rich in orthopyroxene when dehydration occurs at much lower temperatures than melting. In higher pressure facies series it is not well known whether metavolcanic rocks dehydrate or melt at temperatures lower or similar to that of metapelites.</p>

				<title>Some aspects of the role of intergranular fluids in the compositional evolution of metamorphic rocks</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0293-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Minerals that react with each other during the progressive evolution of metamorphic terranes are not always in physical contact. As such, an "intergranular fluid" could play a major role in element transfer and chemical evolution. However, the nature of this uid and its specific role remains somewhat elusive. Recent experiments in our laboratory shed some light on the behavior of such a uid. Here we present a simple mathematical model which accounts for diffusion within crystals and fluid, solubility in the fluid and mass balance between the various reservoirs. The model elucidates the nature of element exchange between two minerals via the mediation of an intergranular fluid. It is shown that a coupling of thermodynamics and kinetics controls the evolution of the system and the concentration of an element in the intergranular fluid is a key parameter of interest.</p>
					<p>The results have important implications for standard tools of metamorphic petrology such as geothermometers and barometers, geospeedometry and the closure of isotopic systems. For example, homogeneity of mineral grains may be a poor criterion for equilibrium and the rim compositions of minerals showing diffusion zoning may be out of equilibrium with distant exchange partners, even in the presence of a uid in which transport is fast.</p>

				<title>Reaction texture and Fe-Mg zoning in granulite garnet from S𝜙strene Island, Antarctica: Modeling and constraint on the time scale of metamorphism during the Pan-African Collisional event</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0305-0312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Garnets from the S𝜙strene island, Antarctica, show reaction textures corresponding to two metamorphic episodes, one at c. 1000 Ma (M1) and the other at c. 500 Ma (M2). The latter is associated with a Pan-African tectono-metamorphic event that has been interpreted to represent a continent-continent collision followed by extensional collapse. Reaction-diffusion modeling of the compositional zoning of garnet associated with the development of reaction texture during M2 yields a time scale of ∼5-16 Myr for the duration of the peak of this overprinting metamorphism at ∼730 ± 20&#176;C. The associated velocity of the reaction front is ∼∼5.0-1.6 𝜇 m/Myr. The inferred duration of peak metamorphism during the Pan-African event seems to be in good agreement with the available U-Pb SHRIMP ages of zircon and monazite that may be interpreted to have formed at the beginning and end stages of crystallization of granite during the metamorphic peak.</p>

				<title>Orogeny, migmatites and leucogranites: A review</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0313-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The type of P-T-t path and availability of fluid (H<sub>2</sub>O-rich metamorphic volatile phase or melt) are important variables in metamorphism. Collisional orogens are characterized by clockwise P-T evolution, which means that in the core, where temperatures exceed the wet solidus for common crustal rocks, melt may be present throughout a significant portion of the evolution. Field observations of eroded orogens show that lower crust is migmatitic, and geophysical observations have been interpreted to suggest the presence of melt in active orogens. A consequence of these results is that orogenic collapse in mature orogens may be controlled by a partially-molten layer that decouples weak crust from subducting lithosphere, and such a weak layer may enable exhumation of deeply buried crust. Migmatites provide a record of melt segregation in partially molten crustal materials and syn-anatectic deformation under natural conditions. Grain boundary ow and intra- and inter-grain fracture ow are the principal grain scale melt ow mechanisms. Field observations of migmatites in ancient orogens show that leucosomes occur oriented in the metamorphic fabrics or are located in dilational sites. These observations are interpreted to suggest that melt segregation and extraction are syntectonic processes, and that melt migration pathways commonly relate to rock fabrics and structures. Thus, leucosomes in depleted migmatites record the remnant permeability network, but evolution of permeability networks and amplification of anomalies are poorly understood. Deformation of partially molten rocks is accommodated by melt-enhanced granularow, and volumetric strain is accommodated by melt loss. Melt segregation and extraction may be cyclic or continuous, depending on the level of applied differential stress and rate of melt pressure buildup. During clockwise P-T evolution, H<sub>2</sub>O is transferred from protolith to melt as rocks cross dehydration melting reactions, and H<sub>2</sub>O may be evolved above the solidus at low P by crossing supra-solidus decompression-dehydration reactions if micas are still present in the depleted protolith. H<sub>2</sub>O dissolved in melt is transported through the crust to be exsolved on crystallization. This recycled H<sub>2</sub>O may promote wet melting at supra-solidus conditions and retrogression at sub-solidus conditions. The common growth of `late' muscovite over sillimanite in migmatite may be the result of this process, and in ux of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O may not be necessary. However, in general, metasomatism in the evolution of the crust remains a contentious issue. Processes in the lower-most crust may be inferred from studies of xenolith suites brought to the surface in lavas. Based on geochemical data, we can use statistical methods and modeling to evaluate whether migmatites are sources or feeder zones for granites, or simply segregated melt that was stagnant in residue, and to compare xenoliths of inferred lower crust with exposed deep crust. Upper-crustal granites are a necessary complement to melt-depleted granulites common in the lower crust, but the role of mafic magma in crustal melting remains uncertain. Plutons occur at various depths above and below the brittle-to-viscous transition in the crust and have a variety of 3-D shapes that may vary systematically with depth. The switch from ascent to emplacement may be caused by amplification of instabilities within (permeability, magma ow rate) or surrounding (strength or state of stress) the ascent column, or by the ascending magma intersecting some discontinuity in the crust that enables horizontal magma emplacement followed by thickening during pluton inflation. Feedback relations between rates of pluton filling, magma ascent and melt extraction maintain compatibility among these processes.</p>

				<title>Patchy charnockites from Jenapore, Eastern Ghats granulite belt, India: Structural and petrochemical evidences attesting to their relict nature</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0337-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The charnockite patches that occur within leptynite host, in and around Jenapore, northern sector of the Eastern Ghats granulite belt, are disposed in a linear fashion and generally have sharp lithological contact with the host leptynite. Sometimes the patches and foliations of the host are cofolded. Also, the patches sometimes have the internal $S_1$ foliation, while the host leptynite records only $S_2$ foliation. Mineralogically and chemically patchy charnockites and host leptynites are distinct entities, and cannot be related by any prograde and retrograde reactions. Particularly important is the peraluminous granitic composition and high Rb/Sr ratios of the leptynites, presumably resulting from biotite-dehydration melting; as against metaluminous granodioritic to tonalitic composition and low Rb/Sr ratios of the patchy charnockites, presumably resulting from hornblende-dehydration melting. The charnockite patches here can be interpreted as caught up patches or xenolith within granitic melt (leptynite). Mg-rich rims of garnet in the charnockite patch were probably caused by heat from the crystallising melt or decompression during ascent of melt.</p>

				<title>Evolution of the Bhandara-Balaghat granulite belt along the southern margin of the Sausar Mobile Belt of central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0351-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Bhandara-Balaghat granulite (BBG) belt occurs as a 190 km long, detached narrow, linear, NE-SW to ENE-WSW trending belt that is in tectonic contact on its northern margin with the Sausar Group of rocks and is bordered by the Sakoli fold belt in the south. The Bhandara part of the BBG belt is quite restricted, comprising a medium to coarse grained two-pyroxene granulite body that is of gabbroic composition and preserves relic igneous fabric. The main part of the belt in Arjuni-Balaghat section includes metasedimentary (quartzite, BIF, Al- and Mg-Al metapelites) and metaigneous (metaultramafic, amphibolite and two-pyroxene granulite) protoliths interbanded with charnockite and charnockitic gneiss. These rocks, occurring as small bands and enclaves within migmatitic and granitic gneisses, show polyphase deformation and metamorphism. Geochemically, basic compositions show tholeiitic trend without Fe-enrichment, non-komatitic nature, continental affinity and show evolved nature. Mineral parageneses and reaction textures in different rock compositions indicate early prograde, dehydration melt forming reactions followed by orthopyroxene stability with or without melt. Coronitic and symplectitic garnets have formed over earlier minerals indicating onset of retrograde IBC path. Evidences for high temperature ductile shearing are preserved at places. Retrogressive hydration events clearly post-date the above paths. The present study has shown that the BBG belt may form a part of the Bastar Craton and does not represent exhumed oceanic crust of the Bundelkhand Craton. It is further shown that rocks of the BBG belt have undergone an earlier high-grade granulite metamorphism at 2672 ± 54 Ma (Sm-Nd age) and a post-peak granulite metamorphism at 1416 ± 59 Ma (Sm-Nd age, 1380 ± 28 Ma Rb-Sr age). These events were followed by deposition of the Sausar supracrustals and Neoproterozoic Sausar orogeny between 973 ± 63 Ma and 800 ± 16 Ma (Rb-Sr ages).</p>

				<title>A reappraisal of polymetamorphism in the Eastern Ghats belt - A view from north of the Godavari rift</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0369-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Evidence collated from different parts of the Eastern Ghats belt north of the Godavari rift (barring the "Western Charnockite Zone") indicates that this sector evolved through a series of compressive structures ($F_1$ to $F_3$), with prolific migmatization in quartzofeldspathic and metapelitic gneisses synchronous with $F_1$ shortening, as was the syn- $F_1$ emplacement of profuse megacrystic K-feldspar-bearing granitoid bodies. Thereafter, melt productivity of the rocks (synchronous with $F_2$ - $F_3$ folding) sharply decreased. Mineral parageneses stable in the $S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_3$ fabrics indicate persistence of granulite facies conditions. P-T estimates on orthopyroxene + garnet + plagioclase + quartz assemblages anchored to recrystallized mosaic that overgrow all penetrative fabric elements in mafic granulites, granitoids and quartzofeldspathic gneisses are in the range of 900&#176;-950&#176;C and $P \cong 8-9$ kbar. This estimate is comparable to those retrieved from sapphirine-bearing paragenesis in Mg-Al metapelites that appear to be diachronous in relation to the fabric elements, and arguably disrupt the granoblastic mosaic. These facets in the northern sector of the orogenic belt are compatible with either a single cycle of tectonic events (i.e., $F_1$, $F_2$ and $F_3$ in continuum), or temporally-separate thermo-tectonic events, with the peak of earlier metamorphism (pre- to syn-$F_1$) at lower temperature (in the granulite facies) in comparison to the record of high post-$F_3$-$T_{\text{max}}$ values.</p>
					<p>It is suggested on the basis of the above evidence that the late Proterozoic/Pan-African granulites in the Eastern Ghats belt north of the Godavari rift, are unlikely to be reworked equivalents of any older granulitic crust, such as the ∼1.6 Ga granulites south of the rift. Instead, the temporally disparate sectors may represent different crustal segments with unconnected pre-amalgamation tectonic history. However, if the ∼1.6 Ga granulites of the Western Charnockite Zone continue northwards across the rift, as suggested by recent isotope data, there are serious doubts as to the validity of a north-south division within the Eastern Ghats belt.</p>

				<title>U-Pb age of the Diana Complex and Adirondack granulite petrogenesis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0385-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>U-Pb isotopic analyses of eight single and multi-grain zircon fractions separated from a syenite of the Diana Complex of the Adirondack Mountains do not define a single linear array, but a scatter along a chord that intersects the Concordia curve at 1145 ± 29 and 285 ± 204 Ma. For the most concordant analyses, the <sup>207</sup>Pb/<sup>206</sup>Pb ages range between 1115 and 1150 Ma. Detailed petrographic studies revealed that most grains contained at least two phases of zircon growth, either primary magmatic cores enclosed by variable thickness of metamorphic overgrowths or magmatic portions enclosing presumably older xenocrystic zircon cores. The magmatic portions are characterized by typical dipyramidal prismatic zoning and numerous black inclusions that make them quite distinct from adjacent overgrowths or cores when observed in polarizing light microscopy and in back- scattered electron micrographs. Careful handpicking and analysis of the "best" magmatic grains, devoid of visible overgrowth of core material, produced two nearly concordant points that along with two of the multi-grain analyses yielded an upper-intercept age of 1118 ± 2.8 Ma and a lower- intercept age of 251 ± 13 Ma. The older age is interpreted as the crystallization age of the syenite and the younger one is consistent with late stage uplift of the Appalachian region. The 1118 Ma age for the Diana Complex, some 35 Ma younger than previously believed, is now approximately synchronous with the main Adirondack anorthosite intrusion, implying a cogenetic relationship among the various meta-igneous rocks of the Adirondacks. The retention of a high-temperature contact metamorphic aureole around Diana convincingly places the timing of Adirondack regional metamorphism as early as 1118 Ma. This result also implies that the sources of anomalous high- temperature during granulite metamorphism are the syn-metamorphic intrusions, such as the Diana Complex.</p>

				<title>The Rajahmundry Traps, Andhra Pradesh: Evaluation of their petrogenesis relative to the Deccan Traps</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Geochemical and geochronological data for rocks from the Rajahmundry Traps, are evaluated for possible correlation with the main Deccan province. Lava flows are found on both banks of the Godavari River and contain an intertrappean sedimentary layer. Based on <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar age data, rocks on the east bank are post K-T boundary, show normal magnetic polarity, and belong to chron 29N. Their chemistry is identical to lavas in the Mahabaleshwar Formation in the Western Ghats, ∼1000 km away. It was suggested earlier that the genetic link between these geographically widely separated rocks resulted from lava owing down freshly incised river canyons at ∼64 Ma. For the west bank rocks, recent paleomagnetic work indicates lava flows below and above the intertrappean (sedimentary) layer show reversed and normal magnetic polarity, respectively. The chemical composition of the west bank ow above the intertrappean layer is identical to rocks on the east bank. The west bank lava lying below the sedimentary layer, shows chemistry similar to Ambenali Formation lava ows in the western Deccan. <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar dating and complete chemical characterization of this ow is required to elucidate its petrogenesis with respect to the main Deccan Province.</p>

				<title>Generation of Deccan Trap magmas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0409-0431</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deccan Trap magmas may have erupted through multiple centers, the most prominent of which may have been a shield volcano-like structure in the Western Ghats area. The lavas are predominantly tholeiitic; alkalic mafic lavas and carbonatites are rare. Radioisotope dating, magnetic chronology, and age constraints from paleontology indicate that although the eruption started some 68 Ma, the bulk of lavas erupted at around 65-66 Ma. Paleomagnetic constraints indicate an uncertainty of ± 500, 000 years for peak volcanic activity at 65 m.y. in the type section of the Western Ghats. Maximum magma residence times were calculated in this study based on growth rates of   "giantplagioclase" crystals in lavas that marked the end phase of volcanic activity of different magma chambers. These calculations suggest that the &gt; 1.7 km thick Western Ghats section might have erupted within a much shorter time interval of ∼55,000 years, implying phenomenal eruption rates that are orders of magnitude larger than any present-day eruption rate from any tectonic environment. Other significant observations/conclusions are as follows: (1) Deccan lavas can be grouped into stratigraphic subdivisions based on their geochemistry; (2) While some formations are relatively uncontaminated others are strongly contaminated by the continental crust; (3) Deccan magmas were produced by 15-30% melting of a Fe-rich lherzolitic source at ∼3-2 GPa; (4) Parent magmas of the relatively uncontaminated Ambenali formation had a primitive composition with 16% MgO, 47% SiO<sub>2</sub>; (5) Deccan magmas were generated much deeper and by significantly more melting than other continental flood basalt provinces; (6) The erupted Deccan tholeiitic lavas underwent fractionation and magma mixing at ∼ 0.2 GPa. The composition and origin of the crust and crust/mantle boundary beneath the Deccan are discussed with respect to the in uence of Deccan magmatic episode.</p>

				<title>Petrology, geochemistry and tectonic settings of the mafic dikes and sills associated with the evolution of the Proterozoic Cuddapah Basin of south India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0433-0453</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this article we summarize the petrological, geochemical and tectonic processes involved in the evolution of the Proterozoic intracratonic Cuddapah basin. We use new and available ages of Cuddapah igneous rocks, together with field, stratigraphic, geophysical and other criteria, to arrive at a plausible model for the timing of these processes during basin evolution. We present petrological and geochronological evidence of dike emplacement along preferred lineament directions around the basin in response to stresses, which may have been responsible for the evolution of the basin itself. Basaltic dike intrusion started on the south Indian shield around 2400 Ma and continued throughout the Cuddapah basin evolution and sedimentation. A deep mantle perturbation, currently manifested by a lopolithic cupola-like intrusion under the southwestern part of the basin, may have occurred at the onset of basin evolution and played an important role in its development. Paleomagnetic, gravity and geochronological evidence indicates that it was a constant thermal source responsible for dike and sill emplacement between 1500 and 1200 Ma both inside and outside the basin. Lineament reactivation in the NW-SE and NE-SW directions, in response to the mantle perturbation, intensified between 1400 and 1200 Ma, leading to the emplacement of several cross cutting dikes.</p>
					<p>Fe-Mg partition coefficients of olivine and augite and Ca-Na partition coefficient of plagioclase, calculated from the composition of these minerals and bulk composition of their host rocks, indicate that the dikes outside the Cuddapah basin are cumulates. The contemporary dikes may be related by fractional crystallization as indicated by a positive correlation between their plagioclase Ca#(atomic Ca/[Ca+Na]) and augite Mg&#35;(atomic Mg/[Mg+Fe]). A few NW-SE and NE-SW cross cutting dikes of the period between 1400 and 1200 Ma, preserve petrographic evidence of episodic magmatic intrusive activity along preferred directions. Petrological reasoning indicates that a magmatic liquid reacted with a set of cross cutting dikes, intruding into one that was already solidified and altering the composition of the magma that produced the other dike.</p>
					<p>The Cuddapah basin tholeiites may be related by fractional crystallization at 5 kb and 1019-1154&#176;C, which occurred in the lopolithic cupola near the southwestern margin of the basin. Xenolith bearing picrites, which occur near the periphery of the cupola, originated by the accumulation of xenoliths in the tholeiites. This is indicated by the composition of the olivine in the xenoliths (Fo<sub>78.7−81.9</sub>), which are closely similar to calculated olivine compositions (Fo<sub>77.8−78.3</sub>) in equilibrium with the tholeiites under the same <i>P-T</i> conditions. It is inferred that fractionation in the cupola resulted in crystals settling on its walls. Hence, the xenolith-bearing sills occur at the periphery of the lopolithic body.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0001-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aftershock sequence of the September 30th, 1993 Killari earthquake in the Latur district of Maharashtra state, India, recorded by 41 temporary seismograph stations are used for estimating 3-D velocity structure in the epicentral area. The local earthquake tomography (LET) method of Thurber (1983) is used. About 1500 𝑃 and 1200 𝑆 wave travel-times are inverted. The 𝑃 and 𝑆 wave velocities as well as $V_P /V_S$ ratio vary more rapidly in the vertical as well as in the horizontal directions in the source region compared to the adjacent areas. The main shock hypocentre is located at the junction of a high velocity and a low velocity zone, representing a fault zone at 6 - 7 km depth. The estimated average errors of 𝑃 velocity and $V_P / V_S$ ratio are ± 0.07 km/s and ± 0.016, respectively. The best resolution of 𝑃 and 𝑆-wave velocities is obtained in the aftershock zone. The 3-D velocity structure and precise locations of the aftershocks suggest a `stationary concept' of the Killari earthquake sequence.</p>

				<page>0017-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analyses of bathymetry, gravity and seismic reflection data of the diffusive plate boundary in the central Indian Ocean reveal a new kind of deformed structure besides the well-reported structures of long-wavelength anticlinal basement rises and high-angle reverse faults. The structure (basement trough) has a length of about 150 km and deepens by up to 1 km from its regional trend (northward dipping). The basement trough includes a rise at its center with a height of about 1.5 km. The rise is about 10 km wide with rounded upper surface and bounded by vertical faults. A broad free-air gravity low of about 20 mGal and a local high of 8 mGal in its center are associated with the identified basement trough and rise structure respectively. Seismic results reveal that the horizontal crustal compression prevailing in the diffusive plate boundary might have formed the basement trough possibly in early Pliocene time. Differential loading stresses have been generated from unequal crust/sediment thickness on lower crustal and upper mantle rocks. A thin semi-ductile serpentinite layer existing near the base of the crust that is interpreted to have been formed at mid-ocean ridge and become part of the lithosphere, may have responded to the downward loading stresses generated by the sediments and crustal rocks to inject the serpentinites into the overlying strata to form a classic diapiric structure.</p>

				<title>Records of climatic changes and volcanic events in an ice core from Central Dronning Maud Land (East Antarctica) during the past century</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The depth profiles of electrical conductance, 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O, <sup>210</sup>Pb and cosmogenic radio isotopes 10Be and <sup>36</sup>Cl have been measured in a 30 m ice core from east Antarctica near the Indian station, Dakshin Gangotri. Using <sup>210</sup>Pb and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O, the mean annual accumulation rates have been calculated to be 20 and 21 cm of ice equivalent per year during the past ∼150 years. Using these acumulation rates, the volcanic event that occurred in 1815 AD, has been identified based on electrical conductance measurements. Based on 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O measurements, the mean annual surface air temperatures (MASAT) data observed during the last 150 years indicates that the beginning of the 19th century was cooler by about 2&#176;C than the recent past and the middle of 18th century. The fallout of cosmogenic radio isotope <sup>10</sup>Be compares reasonably well with those obtained on other stations (73&#176; S to 90&#176;S) from Antarctica and higher latitudes beyond 77&#176;N. The fallout of <sup>36</sup>Cl calculated based on the present work agrees well with the mean global production rate estimated earlier by Lal and Peters (1967) The bomb pulse of <sup>36</sup>Cl observed in Greenland is not observed in the present studies a result which is puzzling and needs to be studied on neighbouring ice cores from the same region.</p>

				<title>Velocity of small-scale auroral ionospheric current systems over Indian Antarctic station Maitri</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0051-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian Antarctic station Maitri (geog. 70&#176; 45/S, 11&#176; 45/E, geom. 66&#176; .03S, 53&#176;.21E) occupies a sub-auroral location during magnetically quiet conditions (𝜎 Kp &lt; 10), but attains an auroral position when the auroral oval shifts equatorwards with increasing strength of magnetic disturbance. At the latter times, triangulation with 3 uxgate magnetometers located at the vertices of a suitable triangle provides a means of monitoring mobile auroral ionospheric current systems over Maitri. The spacing between the magnetometers is typically kept at 75-200 km, keeping in mind the scale-sizes of ∼100 km for these mobile current systems. This work reports the results of two triangulation experiments carried out around Maitri in January 1992 and January 1995, both during Antarctic summer. The velocities estimated for pulsations of the Pc4 and Pc5 type were about 0.59 km/sec in the direction 102&#176;.7 east of due north, in the first case, and about 1-3 km/sec in the second case in the east-west direction.</p>
					<p>While several magnetometer arrays exist in the northern auroral regions (e.g., the Alberta array in Canada, the Alaskan array in the U.S. and the IMS Scandinavian array), there is no report in literature of triangulation through arrays in Antarctica, except for a one-day study by Neudegg <i>et al</i> 1995 for ULF pulsations of the Pc1 and Pc2 type. The velocities obtained for the Pi3 type of irregular pulsations over Antarctica in the present study tally well with those obtained for northern auroral locations.</p>

				<title>Thermal Internal Boundary Layer characteristics at a tropical coastal site as observed by a mini-SODAR under varying synoptic conditions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Atmospheric boundary layer observations are conducted at a coastal site during a transition phase from winter to summer season over the Indian peninsula. Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL) characteristics in presence of an off-shore and a weakly in uenced on-shore synoptic wind are examined with the help of measurements carried out with a mini-SODAR (SOund Detection And Ranging), tethered balloon, and tower-based micrometeorological measurements. In uence of the changing synoptic scale conditions on turbulent characteristics of TIBL is discussed.</p>
					<p>Mini-SODAR data showed the development and decay of sea and land breeze. It is seen that the characteristics of TIBL over the coastal land after sea breeze onset are similar to that of a shallow convective boundary layer (CBL) commonly found over plain land. Inside the TIBL, a maximum wind speed was noted close to the surface due to the penetration of sea breeze. In the off-shore case, a distinct sea breeze circulation was observed unlike in the case of on-shore ow. In the presence of weak on-shore case, a `minor sea' breeze is noted before the establishment of sea breeze and a reduction in the momentum uxes gives rise to decrease in the turbulence intensity. Updraft in the sea breeze front was stronger during weak synoptic conditions. In uence of synoptic changes on the sea breeze-land breeze circulation such as onset, strength and duration of the sea-land breeze are also examined.</p>

				<title>Trace element and isotopic studies of Permo-Carboniferous carbonate nodules from Talchir sediments of peninsular India: Environmental and provenance implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0087-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Syngenetic carbonate nodules constitute an interesting feature of the glaciogene sediments of various Talchir basins in peninsular India. Petrographic, cathodoluminescence and sedimentary results suggest that many of these nodules contain primary carbonate precipitates whose geochemical signatures can be used for determining environment of deposition and provenance of the sediments and drainage source. Several nodules were collected from Gondwana basins of east-central India and analyzed for stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, REE and trace element composition, and Sr isotope ratio. The mean 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O and 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C values of the calcites in the nodules are &#8212; 19.5‰ and -9.7‰ (w.r.t. PDB) respectively suggesting a freshwater environment (probably lacustrine) for formation of these objects. Trace element ratios (Eu/Eu<sup>&#8727;</sup> and La/Yb) of the nodule samples show that the source of the sediments in the Damodar valley basin was the granites, gneisses and intrusives in the Chotanagpur region. The sediments in the Mahanadi valley were derived from granulites, charnockites and granites of the eastern ghat region. The Sr concentration of the carbonate phase of the nodules is low, ranging from 10-60 ng/g . The <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios of the samples from the west Bokaro basin and Ramgarh basin vary from 0.735 to 0.748 (mean: 0.739) and from 0.726 to 0.733 (mean: 0.730) respectively. These values are consistent with our proposition that water of these basins drained through the granitic rocks of the Chotanagpur region. In contrast, the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios of the samples from the Talchir basin (Type area) of Mahanadi valley vary from 0.718 to 0.723 (mean: 0.719). These <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios are close to those of the granulites in the adjoining eastern ghat belt suggesting that area as the drainage source.</p>

				<title>Electron spin resonance dating of fault gouge from Desamangalam, Kerala: Evidence for Quaternary movement in Palghat gap shear zone</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0103-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The field investigations in the epicentral area of the 1994 Wadakkancheri (Desamangalam), Kerala, earthquake (M 4.3) indicate subtle, but clearly recognizable expressions of geologically recent fault zone, consisting of fracture sets showing brittle displacement and a gouge zone. The fracture zone confines to the crystalline basement, and is spatially coincident with the elongation of the isoseismals of the 1994 mainshock and a 10-km-long WNW-ESE trending topographic lineament. The preliminary results from the electron spin resonance (ESR) dating on the quartz grains from the fault gouge indicate that the last major faulting in this site occurred 430 ± 43 ka ago. The experiments on different grain sizes of quartz from the gouge showed consistent decrease in age to a plateau of low values, indicating that ESR signals in finer grains were completely zeroed at the time of faulting due to frictional heat. The results show a relatively young age for displacement on the fault that occurs within a Precambrian shear zone. Discrete reactivated faults in such areas may be characterized by low degree of activity, but considering the ESR age of the last significant faulting event, the structure at Desamangalam may be categorized as a potentially active fault capable of generating moderate earthquakes, separated by very long periods of quiescence.</p>

					<p>Static deformation of two monoclinic elastic half-spaces in welded contact due to a long inclined strike-slip fault situated in one of the half-spaces is studied analytically and numerically. Closedform algebraic expressions for the displacement at any point of the medium are obtained. The variation of the displacement at the interface with the horizontal distance from the fault is studied. The effect of anisotropy on the displacement field is examined. It is found that while the anisotropy of the source half-space has a significant effect on the displacement at the interface, the anisotropy of the other half-space has only a marginal effect.</p>

					<p>Eigenvalue approach, following Laplace and Fourier transforms, has been employed to find the general solution to the field equations in an anisotropic liquid-saturated porous medium, in the transformed domain. The results of isotropic liquid-saturated porous medium can be derived as a special case. A numerical inversion technique has been applied to get the solutions in the physical domain. To illustrate the utility of the approach, an application of infinite space with impulsive force at the origin has been considered.

				<page>0153-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analysis of monthly momentum transport of zonal waves at 850 hPa for the period 1979 to 1993, between 30&#176;S and 30&#176;N for January to April, using zonal (𝑢) and meridional (𝜐) components of wind taken from the ECMWF reanalysis field, shows a positive correlation (.1% level of significance) between the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (June through September) and the momentum transport of wave zero TM(0) over latitudinal belt between 25&#176;S and 5&#176;N (LB) during March. Northward (Southward) TM(0) observed in March over LB subsequently leads to a good (drought) monsoon season over India which is found to be true even when the year is marked with the El- Nino event. Similarly a strong westerly zone in the Indian Ocean during March, indicates a good monsoon season for the country, even if the year is marked with El-Nino. The study thus suggests two predictors, TM(0) over LB and the strength of westerly zone in the Indian Ocean during March.</p>

				<title>Seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton pigment in the Laccadive (Lakshadweep) Sea as observed by the Coastal Zone Color Scanner</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0163-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on Coastal Zone Color Scanner data from November 1978 through December 1981, the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton pigment in the upper part of the euphotic zone is established for the off shore Laccadive Sea. Year-round, the pigment content is low and the seasonal range is small, following the pattern of the nutrient-poor Arabian Sea to the west. Apparently, indigenous phytoplankton blooms are absent. July and August, however, were poorly studied because of cloud cover. Interannual differences during the northeast monsoon and the spring intermonsoon periods are minor. The abundant phytoplankton caused by the upwelling off India during the southwest monsoon remains essentially restricted to the shelf, but there are occasional large, zonal outbreaks into the Laccadive Sea, as well as others advected to the south of India. Visual inspection of the raw CZCS scenes for June through November 1982-1985, with almost no data until August or even September, shows such outbreaks of pigment-rich water to be common. Inspection of monthly SeaWiFS images for 1997 through part of 2001 confirms the absence of indigenous phytoplankton blooms.</p>

				<title>Retrieval of sea surface velocities using sequential Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0189-0195</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-P4 (Oceansat-I) launched on May 26th, 1999 carried two sensors on board, i.e., the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and the Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR) dedicated for oceanographic research. Sequential data of IRS-P4 OCM has been analysed over parts of both east and west coast of India and a methodology to retrieve sea surface current velocities has been applied. The method is based on matching suspended sediment dispersion patterns, in sequential two time lapsed images. The pattern matching is performed on a pair of atmospherically corrected and geo-referenced sequential images by Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) technique. The MCC technique involves computing matrices of cross-correlation coe#cients and identifying correlation peaks. The movement of the pattern can be calculated knowing the displacement of windows required to match patterns in successive images. The technique provides actual flow during a specified period by integrating both tidal and wind influences. The current velocities retrieved were compared with synchronous data collected along  the east coast during the GSI cruise ST-133 of R.V. Samudra Kaustubh in January 2000. The current data were measured using the ocean current meter supplied by the Environmental Measurement and CONtrol (EMCON), Kochi available with the Geological Survey of India, Marine Wing. This current meter can measure direction and magnitude with an accuracy of ± 5&#176; and 2% respectively. The measurement accuracies with coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of 0.99, for both magnitude (cm.s<sup>-1</sup>) and direction (deg.) were achieved.</p>

				<title>Estimation of colored dissolved organic matter and salinity fields in case 2 waters using SeaWiFS: Examples from Florida Bay and Florida Shelf</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0197-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estimates of water quality variables such as chlorophyll 𝑎 concentration (Chl), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), or salinity from satellite sensors are of great interest to resource managers monitoring coastal regions such as the Florida Bay and the Florida Shelf. However, accurate  stimates of these variables using standard ocean color algorithms have been di#cult due to the complex nature of the light field in these environments. In this study, we process SeaWiFS satellite  data using two recently developed algorithms; one for atmospheric correction and the other a semi-analytic bio-optical algorithm and compare the results with standard SeaWiFS algorithms. Overall, the two algorithms produced more realistic estimates of Chl and CDOM distributions in Florida Shelf and Bay waters. Estimates of surface salinity were obtained from the CDOM absorption field assuming a conservative mixing behavior of these waters. A comparison of SeaWiFS-derived Chl and CDOM absorption with field measurements in the Florida Bay indicated that although well correlated, CDOM was underestimated, while Chl was overestimated. Bottom reflectance appeared to affect these estimates at the shallow central Bay stations during the winter. These results demonstrate the need for new bio-optical algorithms or tuning of the parameters used in the bio-optical  algorithm for local conditions encountered in the Bay.</p>

				<title>Primary production in the Sulu Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0209-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Sulu Sea, located between Borneo and the Philippines, is separated from the surrounding ocean by two chains of islands. There are no passages below 500m depth and the basin, which at the deepest is 5,000 m, is filled with warm low oxygen water.</p>
					<p>The near surface chlorophyll concentration has been examined with the aid of ocean colour sensors on board satellites. Direct comparisons between a field observation of chlorophyll and its remotely sensed values from OCTS (Ocean Colour Temperature Scanner) are found to be in satisfactory agreement. An 8-month time series of chlorophyll near the centre of the Sulu Sea has been used to show that the chlorophyll level is significantly higher than the level in the adjacent South China Sea. This was most pronounced at the period of change between the monsoons. The greater primary productivity may provide the explanation for the higher deposition rate of carbon in the Sulu Sea.</p>
					<p>Although the Sulu Sea is more productive than the adjacent South China Sea, the central area can still be classified as a desert. Estimates of the new primary production in the central Sulu Sea seem to be just su#cient to support the current fishery.</p>

				<title>Seasonal and interannual variations in pigments in the Adriatic Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0215-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spatial and temporal variability of pigments was studied from the CZCS satellite data and from <i>in situ</i> chlorophyll and transparency for the period 1979-1985. The three Adriatic sites, Northern, Middle, and Southern Adriatic are differently in oceanographic parameters. The differences between seasonal <i>in situ</i> chlorophyll and remotely sensed pigment concentrations (from CZCS satellite data) from the Adriatic are large in winter. Through the correlation analysis, pigments were compared to meteo-oceanographic and hydrological parameters from different Adriatic sites. The PCA (principal component analysis) was applied to the pigment data series and significant components were compared. Different correlations are obtained for warm and cold periods of the year pointing to seasonal differences in the underlying mechanism of pigment variability. The first PC is in more parameters seem to in field, than in the cold period. The pigments in the Adriatic are in good correlation to a number of hydrologic and meteo-oceanographic factors.</p>

				<title>Variability of photosynthetic pigments in the Colombian Pacific Ocean and its relationship with the wind field using ADEOS-I data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0227-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variability of the oceanographic conditions in the Colombian Pacific Ocean, a part of the Panama Basin, is subjected to the variability of wind conditions in the equatorial part of the Pacific Ocean. Data of OCTS and NSCAT of ADEOS-I satellite provided as monthly averages for the period November 1996 &#8212; June 1997 by NASDA, were processed and manipulated. A meridional (N-S) component and a zonal (E-W) component were run in order to analyse the data variability and correlation. It is concluded that the variability of the oceanic surface chlorophyll and SST in the Colombian Pacific is a seasonal event related to the migration of the ITCZ and the generation of a wind jet at the Isthmus of Panama. Upwelling due to the wind rotor is present throughout the whole period, with variable spatial distribution and a tendency to be located towards the eastern part of the basin. In a similar way, high chlorophyll concentrations observed in March coincide with both the intensification of the vertical velocities during that month, and the maximal rise of the thermocline in the northern part of the Panama Basin. Picture series of surface chlorophyll, SST, wind stress and Ekman pumping are provided for the studied area.</p>

				<title>Vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient ($K_d$) based optical classification of IRS-P3 MOS-B satellite ocean colour data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0237-0245</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The optical classification of the different water types provides vital input for studies related to primary productivity, water clarity and determination of euphotic depth. Image data of the IRS- P3 MOS-B, for Path 90 of 27th February, 1998 was used for deriving vertical diffuse attenuation Coeffcient ($K_d$) and an optical classification based on $K_d$ values was performed. An atmospheric correction scheme was used for retrieving water leaving radiances in blue and green channels of 412, 443, 490 and 550 nm. The upwelling radiances from 443nm and 550nm spectral channels were used for computation of vertical diffuse attenuation coeffcient $K_d$ at 490 nm. The waters off the Gujarat coast were classified into different water types based on Jerlov classification scheme. The oceanic water type IA ($K_{d}$ range 0.035$-$0.040m<sup>-1</sup>), type IB (0.042$-$0.065m<sup>-1</sup>), type II (0.07$-$0.1m<sup>-1</sup>) and type III (0.115$-$0.14m<sup>-1</sup>) were identified. For the coastal waters along Gujarat coast and Gulf of Kachchh, $K_d$(490) values ranged between 0.15m<sup>-1</sup> and 0.35m<sup>-1</sup>. The depth of 1% of surface light for water type IA, IB, II and III corresponds to 88, 68, 58 and 34 meters respectively. Classification of oceanic and coastal waters based on $K_d$ is useful in understanding the light transmission characteristics for sub-marine navigation and under-water imaging.</p>

				<title>Intercomparison of IRS-P4-MSMR derived geophysical products with DMSP-SSM/I and TRMM-TMI finished products</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0247-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, MSMR geophysical products like Integrated Water Vapour (IWV), Ocean Surface Wind Speed (OWS) and Cloud Liquid Water (CLW) in different grids of 50, 75 and 150 kms are compared with similar products available from other satellites like DMSP-SSM/I and TRMM- TMI. MSMR derived IWV, OWS and CLW compare well with SSM/I and TMI finished products. Comparison of MSMR derived CLW with that derived from TMI and SSM/I is relatively in less agreement. This is possibly due to the use of 37 GHz in SSM/I and TMI that is highly sensitive to CLW, while 37 GHz channels are not available on MSMR. Monthly comparison of MSMR geo- physical products with those from TMI is all carried out for climatological purpose. The monthly comparisons were much better compared to instantaneous comparisons. In this paper, details of the data analysis and comparison results are presented. The usefulness of the MSMR vis-#a-vis other sensors is also discussed.</p>

				<title>Rain rate measurements over global oceans from IRS-P4 MSMR</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0257-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper rain estimation capability of MSMR is explored. MSMR brightness temperature data of six channels corresponding to three frequencies of 10, 18 and 21 GHz are colocated with the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) derived rain rates to find a new empirical algorithm for rain rate by multiple regression. Multiple correlation analysis involving various combinations of channels in linear and non-linear forms and rain rate from TMI is carried out, and thus the best possible algorithm for rain rate measurement was identified which involved V and H polarized brightness temperature measurements at 10 and 18 GHz channels. This algorithm explained about 82 per cent correlation (𝑟) with rain rate, and 1.61 mm h<sup>-1</sup> of error of estimation.</p>
					<p>Further, this algorithm is used for generating global average rain rate map for two contrasting months of August (2000) and January (2001) of northern and southern hemispheric summers, respectively. MSMR derived monthly averaged rain rates are compared with similar estimates from TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), and it was found that MSMR derived rain rates match well, quantitatively and qualitatively, with that from PR.</p>

				<title>Wind-driven circulation in the subarctic north Pacific using altimeter data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0267-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-dependent wind-driven circulation in the subarctic north Pacific is investigated by using Topex/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) wind data for about 6 years. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of the T/P- derived sea level anomaly (SLA) without the variation related to the steric height change (SLA1) and the first EOF of the ECMWF-based wind stress curl fields represent basin-sized south-north oscillations and their time series agree well with a correlation of 0.49. They appear to express the spin-up and spin-down of the subarctic gyre. The third EOF of SLA (SLA3) and the second EOF of the wind stress curl are also related to the variation of the subarctic gyre. Though the correlation of their time series is 0.27, drastic changes in early winter coincide well. The two EOF pairs can be considered to mean that the SLA variation followed by the latitudinal migration of the Aleutian low is separated into two standing oscillation patterns, that is, the sea level variation combined with SLA1 and SLA3 expresses seasonal variations of the wind-driven circulation of the subarctic gyre. The interannual SLAs constructed by subtracting the SLA1 and SLA3 components clearly show trans-pacific westward propagation even in the high-latitudes. The time series of SLA1 is in agreement with that of <i>in situ</i> SLAs measured with the tide gauge at Petropavlovsk (53-01N, 158-38E), which implies the possibility to monitor the subarctic circulation using tide gauge data.</p>

				<title>Oceanic eddies in synthetic aperture radar images</title>

				<page>0281-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous observations since 1991 by using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on board the Almaz-1, ERS-1/2, JERS-1, and RADARSAT satellites support the well-known fact that oceanic eddies are distributed worldwide in the ocean. The paper is devoted to an evaluation of the potential of SAR for detection of eddies and vortical motions in the ocean. The classification of typical vortical features in the ocean detected in remote sensing images (visible, infrared, and SAR) is presented as well as available information on their spatial and temporal scales. Examples of the Almaz-1 and ERS-1/2 SAR images showing different eddy types, such as rings, spiral eddies of the open ocean, eddies behind islands and in bays, spin-off eddies and mushroom-like structures (vortex dipoles) are given and discussed. It is shown that a common feature for most of the eddies detected in the SAR images is a broad spectrum of spatial scales, spiral shape and shear nature. It is concluded that the spaceborne SARs give valuable information on ocean eddies, especially in combination with visible and infrared satellite data.</p>

				<title>Auto-correlation analysis of ocean surface wind vectors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0297-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nature of the inherent temporal variability of surface winds is analyzed by comparison of winds obtained through different measurement methods. In this work, an auto-correlation analysis of a time series data of surface winds measured <i>in situ</i> by a deep water buoy in the Indian Ocean has been carried out. Hourly time series data available for 240 hours in the month of May, 1999 were subjected to an auto-correlation analysis. The analysis indicates an exponential fall of the auto- correlation in the first few hours with a decorrelation time scale of about 6 hours. For a meaningful comparison between satellite derived products and <i>in situ</i> data, satellite data acquired at different time intervals should be used with appropriate `weights', rather than treating the data as concurrent in time. This paper presents a scheme for temporal weighting using the auto-correlation analysis. These temporal `weights' can potentially improve the root mean square (rms) deviation between satellite and <i>in situ</i> measurements. A case study using the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and Indian Ocean buoy wind speed data resulted in an improvement of about 10%.</p>

				<title>Study of the relationship between non-dimensional roughness length and wave age, effected by wave directionality</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0305-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relationship between the non-dimensional roughness length and inverse of wave age has been discussed without consideration of wave directions, though wind wave field consists of various directional component waves. In this study we observe wave heights by an array of four wave gauges at the Hiratsuka Tower of (Independent Administrative Institution) National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED), Japan, and discuss the effect of wave directionality. As a result, the data sets were classified into two different groups according to the directional wave spectrum distribution. In case 1 only swell and wind waves exist and in case 2 there exist wave components from several directions. It is shown that the case of multiple- directional component waves (case 2) may affect the non-dimensional roughness length and friction velocity.</p>

				<title>Oceanic whitecaps: Sea surface features detectable via satellite that are indicators of the magnitude of the air-sea gas transfer coefficient</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0315-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stage A whitecaps (spilling wave crests) have a microwave emissivity of close to 1. Thus if even a small fraction of the sea surface is covered by these features there will be a detectable enhancement in the apparent microwave brightness temperature of that surface as determined by satellite-borne microwave radiometers. This increase in the apparent microwave brightness temperature can as a consequence be routinely used to estimate the fraction of the sea surface covered by stage A whitecaps. For all but the very lowest wind speeds it has been shown in a series of controlled experiments that the air-sea gas transfer coeffcient for each of a wide range of gases, including carbon dioxide and oxygen, is directly proportional to the fraction of the sea surface covered by these stage A whitecaps.</p>

					<p>A high resolution model, using the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM), has been implemented for the first time to study the seasonal circulation and coastal upwelling off the southwest Indian coast during 1974. This model is part of a model and data assimilation system capable of describing the ocean circulation and variability in the Indian Ocean and its predictability in response to the monsoon system.</p>
					<p>Along the southwest coast of India the dominant coastal current is the reversing West Indian Coastal Current which is well simulated and described, in addition to the weaker undercurrent of the opposite direction. Upwelling of cold water, 4&#176;C lower than offshore temperatures appear in April. The upwelling intensifies with the southwest monsoon and is simulated in accordance with <i>in situ</i> observations. Upwelling appears to be strongest off Cochin and Quilon, and the upwelling of cold water is seen together with a decrease in salinity in the model simulation.</p>

				<title>Chlorophyll modulation of mixed layer thermodynamics in a mixed-layer isopycnal General Circulation Model - An example from Arabian Sea and equatorial Pacific</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0339-0349</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Western tropical Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and the equatorial Pacific are known as regions of intense bio-chemical-physical interactions: the Arabian Sea has the largest phytoplankton bloom with seasonal signal, while the equatorial Pacific bloom is perennial with quasi-permanent upwelling. Here, we studied three dimensional ocean thermodynamics comparing recent ocean observation with ocean general circulation model (OPYC) experiment combined with remotely sensed chlorophyll pigment concentrations from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). Using solar radiation parameterization representing observations that a higher abundance of chlorophyll increases absorption of solar irradiance and heating rate in the upper ocean, we showed that the mixed layer thickness decreases more than they would be under clear water conditions. These changes in the model mixed layer were consistent with Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) observations during the 1994-1995 Arabian Sea experiment and epi-fluorescence microscopy (EFM) on samples collected during Equatorial Pacific Ocean Climate Study (EPOCS) in November, 1988. In the Arabian Sea, as the chlorophyll concentrations peak in October (3mg/m<sup>3</sup>) after the summer plankton bloom induced by coastal upwelling, the chlorophyll induced biological heating enhanced the sea surface temperature (SST) by as much as 0.6&#176;C and sub-layer temperature decreases and sub-layer thickness increases. In the equatorial Pacific, modest concentrations of chlorophyll less than 0.3mg/m<sup>3</sup> is enough to introduce a meridional differential heating, which results in reducing the equatorial mixed layer thickness to more than 20 m. The anomalous meridional tilting of the mixed layer bottom enhances off equatorial westward geostrophic currents. Consequently, the equatorial undercurrent transports more water from west to east. We proposed that these numerical model experiments with use of satellite and <i>in situ</i> ocean observations are consistent under three dimensional ocean circulation theory combined with solar radiation transfer process.</p>

				<title>Assimilation of IRS-P4 (MSMR) meteorological data in the NCMRWF global data assimilation system</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0351-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oceansat-1 was successfully launched by India in 1999, with two payloads, namely Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR) and Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) to study the biological and physical parameters of the ocean. The MSMR sensor is configured as an eight-channel radiometer using four frequencies with dual polarization. The MSMR data at 75km resolution from the Oceansat-I have been assimilated in the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) data assimilation forecast system. The operational analysis and forecast system at NCMRWF is based on a T80L18 global spectral model and Spectral Statistical Inter-polation (SSI) scheme for data analysis. The impact of the MSMR data is seen globally, however it is significant over the oceanic region where conventional data are rare. The dry-nature of the control analyses have been removed by utilizing the MSMR data. Therefore, the total precipitable water data from MSMR has been identified as a very crucial parameter in this study. The impact of surface wind speed from MSMR is to increase easterlies over the tropical Indian Ocean. Shifting of the positions of westerly troughs and ridges in the south Indian Ocean has contributed to reduction of temperature to around 30&#176;S.</p>

				<title>Meteorological fields variability over the Indian seas in pre and summer monsoon months during extreme monsoon seasons</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0365-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the possible linkage between summer monsoon rainfall over India and surface meteorological fields (basic fields and heat budget components) over monsoon region (30&#176; E-120&#176;E, 30&#176;S-30&#176;N) during the pre-monsoon month of May and summer monsoon season (June to September) are examined. For this purpose, monthly surface meteorological fields anomaly are analyzed for 42 years (1958-1999) using reanalysis data of NCEP/NCAR (National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research). The statistical significance of the anomaly (difference) between the surplus and deficient monsoon years in the surface meteorological fields are also examined by Student's t-test at 95% confidence level.</p>
					<p>Significant negative anomalies of mean sea level pressure are observed over India, Arabian Sea and Arabian Peninsular in the pre-monsoon month of May and monsoon season. Significant positive anomalies in the zonal and meridional wind (at 2m) in the month of May are observed in the west Arabian Sea off Somali coast and for monsoon season it is in the central Arabian Sea that extends up to Somalia. Significant positive anomalies of the surface temperature and air temperature (at 2m) in the month of May are observed over north India and adjoining Pakistan and Afghanistan region. During monsoon season this region is replaced by significant negative anomalies. In the month of May, significant positive anomalies of cloud amount are observed over Somali coast, north Bay of Bengal and adjoining West Bengal and Bangladesh. During monsoon season, cloud amount shows positive anomalies over NW India and north Arabian Sea.</p>
					<p>There is overall reduction in the incoming shortwave radiation flux during surplus monsoon years. A higher magnitude of latent heat flux is also found in surplus monsoon years for the month of May as well as the monsoon season. The significant positive anomaly of latent heat flux in May, observed over southwest Arabian Sea, may be considered as an advance indicator of the possible behavior of the subsequent monsoon season. The distribution of net heat flux is predominantly negative over eastern Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean. Anomaly between the two extreme monsoon years in post 1980 (i.e., 1988 and 1987) shows that shortwave flux, latent heat flux and net heat flux indicate reversal in sign, particularly in south Indian Ocean. Variations of the heat budget components over four smaller sectors of Indian seas, namely Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and west Indian Ocean and east Indian Ocean show that a small sector of Arabian Sea is most dominant during May and other sectors showing reversal in sign of latent heat flux during monsoon season.</p>

					<p>Enriched <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup> ratios with 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C ∼3‰ (w.r.t PDB) of two Late Riphean (∼700-610Ma) intracratonic carbonate successions viz., Bhander Limestone of Vindhyan Basin and Raipur Limestone of Chattisgarh Basin suggest higher organic productivity during this period. This view is supported by sedimentological evidence of higher biohermal growth and consequent increase in depositional relief in the low gradient ramp settings inferred for these basins. Oxygen isotope analysis of these carbonates show distinct segregation between enriched deeper water carbonate mudstone and depleted shallow water stromatolite facies that received fresh water influx. This shows that facies-specific analyses can be useful in understanding the depositional setting of these sediments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Spectacular exposures of granulite-migmatite occur in the Chilka Lake area of the Eastern Ghats belt. The garnetiferous granite gneiss of peraluminous granitic composition, often contains restitic metapelite inclusions and is demonstrably a product of biotite-dehydration melting in pelitic rocks. On the other hand, older layers and bands of charnockitic rocks frequently occur as dismembered patches within the peraluminous granite, thus imparting a measled appearance of the granite exposures.</p>
					<p>The partial melting and emplacement of the peraluminous granite represent the Grenvillian thermal event, as evidenced by Rb-Sr whole rock and Pb-Pb zircon dating. On the other hand, minor patches of charnockite represent migmatized relict, as evidenced by some older zircons, in addition to those of Grenvillian age.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of plane waves in an anisotropic elastic medium possessing monoclinic symmetry is discussed. The expressions for the phase velocity of <i>qP</i> and <i>qSV</i> waves propagating in the plane of elastic symmetry are obtained in terms of the direction cosines of the propagation vector. It is shown that, in general, <i>qP</i> waves are not longitudinal and <i>qSV</i> waves are not transverse. Pure longitudinal and pure transverse waves can propagate only in certain specific directions. Closed-form expressions for the reflection coefficients of <i>qP</i> and <i>qSV</i> waves incident at the free surface of a homogeneous monoclinic elastic half-space are obtained. These expressions are used for studying numerically the variation of the reflection coefficients with the angle of incidence. The present analysis corrects some fundamental errors appearing in recent papers on the subject.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of low frequency oscillations of the atmosphere-ocean coupling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0413-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The low frequency oscillation of latent heat flux over the tropical oceans has been studied. The NCEP reanalyzed fields of wind and humidity alongwith Reynolds SST are used to compute the instantaneous as well as monthly mean surface latent heat fluxes (LHF) for the year 1999. The procedure of LHF computation is based on bulk method. Spectral analysis shows that significant energy is contained in Madden Julian Oscillation band in the winds, SST, moisture and in  the latent heat flux. The global distribution of wind, humidity, SST and LHF oscillation on the time scale of 30-50 days are analyzed. Maximum amplitude of oscillation on this time scale in all the above mentioned parameters were found over the Indian Ocean. The fluctuation of surface wind speed and moisture controls the latent heat flux on this time scale. The fluctuation of SST on this time scale does not seem to be important over most of the oceans.</p>

				<title>Detection of marine aerosols with IRS P4-Ocean Colour Monitor</title>

				<page>0425-0435</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The atmospheric correction bands 7 and 8 (765nm and 865nm respectively) of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS P4-OCM (Ocean Colour Monitor) can be used for deriving aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the oceans. A retrieval algorithm has been developed which computes the AOD using band 7 data by treating the ocean surface as a dark background after removing the Rayleigh path radiance in the sensor-detected radiances.

				<title>Study on the sensitivity of the vertical cooling (heat sink) on the displacements of the mid-tropospheric ridge using a linear model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0437-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A linear model of the response of a stratified atmosphere to isolated heat sources in spherical coordinates is used to study the maintenance of the mean position of the mid tropospheric ridge and its displacement. It is well known that the performance of the southwest Indian monsoon is related to the latitudinal position of the April 500 hPa ridge along 75&#176;E. It was demonstrated that an anomalous cooling associated with the increased snow cover in Eurasia can result in moderate southward displacement of the mid-tropospheric ridge. The results of this study indicate that the vertically integrated cooling rate (strength of heat sink) has more effect on the southward displacement of the ridge when the sink is closer to the ridge.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0467-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Laboratory studies of 30 samples from 158m long drill core of the Hole 1105A (ODP Leg 179) of the Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge have revealed magnetic properties of the gabbros, olivine gabbros, oxide gabbros and olivine oxide gabbros down the core. Comparison of modal proportions of the oxides, grain sizes and magnetization parameters of the rocks has confirmed that most coarse-grained oxide mineral bearing rocks record low Koenigsberger ratio (2 to 5) and median destructive fields (5 to 7 mT). Average natural remanent magnetization ($J_{nrm}$) and stable remanent magnetization ($J_{st}$) of the core samples are 5.8A/m and 1.9 A/m, respectively. Their mean stable magnetic inclination is 66&#176; ± 4&#176;, about 14&#176; steeper than the expected dipole inclination of the area similar to the one reported at Hole 735 B. The excess inclination perhaps marks a tectonic block rotation of the reversely magnetized rocks of the bank. We interpret that gabbros and serpentinites devoid of basaltic carapace significantly contribute to seafloor spreading anomalies of the bank.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary sea level and environmental changes from relic carbonate deposits of the western margin of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relic carbonate deposits along the western margin of India occur as dolomite crusts, aragonite sands (pelletal / oolitic) and aragonite-cemented limestones, oyster shells, corals, encrusted coralline algal and foraminiferal-dominated nodules. The petrology and mineralogy of the deposits indicate that except for aragonite sands and foraminiferal nodules, the others were formed in shallow marine conditions and serve as sea level indicators. Radiocarbon dates were measured for 62 relic deposits covering the entire margin. The age of these deposits on the continental shelf off Cape Comorin and Mangalore, between 110 and 18m depth, ranges between 12, 610 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP and 6,390 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP. On the northwestern margin of India, especially on the carbonate platform (between 64 and 100 m), the age ranges from 17,250 to 6,730 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP. The relic deposits of the Gulf of Kachchh at depths between 35 and 25m are dated at 12,550-9,630 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP. The age vs. depth plot of the relic deposits further indicates that the Gulf of Kachchh was inundated much early, atleast by 15 ka, after the Last Glacial Maximum, and was subjected to uplift and subsidence during the Holocene. The carbonate platform subsided during the early Holocene. Some of the relic deposits between Cape Comorin and Mangalore plot on or, closely follow the glacio-eustatic sea level curve. Despite abundant siliciclastic flux discharged by the Narmada and Tapti during the early Holocene, the platform off these rivers is largely devoid of this flux and carbonate sedimentation continued until 6,700 <sup>14</sup>C yr BP. We suggest that the river-derived ediment flux diverted southwards under the influence of the SW monsoon current and, thereby, increased the turbidity on the shelf and slope southeast of the carbonate platform and facilitated the formation of deeper water foraminiferal nodules off Vengurla-Goa.</p>

				<title>Effects of galvanic distortions on magnetotelluric data: Interpretation and its correction using deep electrical data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0027-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The non-inductive galvanic disturbances due to surficial bodies, lying smaller than high frequency skin depth, cause serious interpretational errors in magnetotelluric data. These frequency independent distortions result in a quasi-static shift between the apparent resistivity curves known as static shift. Two-dimensional modelling studies, for the effects of surficial bodies on magnetotelluric interpretation, show that the transverse electric (TE) mode apparent resistivity curves are hardly affected compared to the transverse magnetic (TM) mode curves, facilitating the correction by using a curve shifting method to match low frequency asymptotes. But in the case of field data the problem is rather complicated because of the random distribution of geometry and conductivity of near surface inhomogeneities. Here we present the use of deep resistivity sounding (DRS) data to constrain MT static shift. Direct current sensitivity studies show that the behaviour of MT static shift can be estimated using DC resistivity measurements close to the MT sounding station to appreciable depths. The distorted data set is corrected using the MT response for DRS model and further subject to joint inversion with DRS data. Joint inversion leads to better estimation of MT parameters compared to the separate inversion of data sets.</p>

				<title>2D Stabilised analytic signal method in DC pole-pole potential data interpretation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0037-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using analytic signal method, interpretation of pole-pole secondary electric potentials due to 2D conductive/resistive prisms is presented. The estimated parameters are the location, lateral extent or width and depth to top surface of the prism. Forward modelling is attempted by 2D-Finite Difference method. The proposed stabilised analytic signal algorithm (RES2AS) uses Tikhonov's regularization scheme and FFT routines. The algorithm is tested on three theoretical examples and field data from the campus of Roorkee University. The stability of RES2AS is also tested on synthetic error prone secondary pole-pole potential data.</p>

				<page>0051-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temporal variations have been observed in both dissolved helium and TDS in the form of increase in basaltic and decrease in alluvial aquifers. The increase in basaltic aquifers has been explained by enhanced pumping of old groundwater with relatively higher concentration of dissolved helium and salt, whereas the decrease in alluvial aquifers has been explained by dilution from the post monsoon groundwater recharge. Therefore, the observed temporal variations cannot be ascribed to the contemporary enhanced seismic activity in this region since August-September 2000.</p>

				<title>Indian Ocean surface winds from NCMRWF analysis as compared to QuikSCAT and moored buoy winds</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0061-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The quality of the surface wind analysis at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (NCMRWF), New Delhi over the tropical Indian Ocean and its improvement in 2001 are examined by comparing it with <i>in situ</i> buoy measurements and satellite derived surface winds from NASA QuikSCAT satellite (QSCT) during 1999, 2000 and 2001. The NCMRWF surface winds su ered from easterly bias of 1.0-1.5 ms<sup>-1</sup> in the equatorial Indian Ocean (IO) and northerly bias of 2.0-3.0 ms<sup>-1</sup> in the south equatorial IO during 1999 and 2000 compared to QSCT winds. The amplitude of daily variability was also underestimated compared to that in QSCT. In particular, the amplitude of daily variability of NCMRWF winds in the eastern equatorial IO was only about 60% of that of QSCT during 1999 and 2000. The NCMRWF surface winds during 2001 have significantly improved with the bias of the mean analyzed winds considerably reduced everywhere bringing it to within $0.5 ms^{-1}$ of QSCT winds in the equatorial IO. The amplitude and phase of daily and intraseasonal variability are very close to that in QSCT almost everywhere during 2001. It is shown that the weakness in the surface wind analysis during 1999 and 2000 and its improvement in 2001 are related to the weakness in simulation of precipitation by the forecast model in the equatorial IO and its improvement in 2001. </p>

				<title>Impact of horizontal resolution on prediction of tropical cyclones over Bay of Bengal using a regional weather prediction model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0079-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is carried out to examine the performance of a regional atmospheric model in forecasting tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal and its sensitivity to horizontal resolution. Two cyclones, which formed over the Bay of Bengal during the years 1995 and 1997, are simulated using a regional weather prediction model with two horizontal resolutions of 165km and 55 km. The model is found to perform reasonably well towards simulation of the storms. The structure, intensity and track of the cyclones are found to be better simulated by finer resolution of the model as compared to the coarse resolution. Rainfall amount and its distribution are also found to be sensitive to the model horizontal resolution. Other important fields, viz., vertical velocity, horizontal divergence and horizontal moisture flux are also found to be sensitive to model horizontal resolution and are better simulated by the model with finer horizontal grids.</p>

				<title>The Indian summer monsoon as revealed by NCMRWF system</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0095-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, we present the mean seasonal features of the Indian summer monsoon circulation in the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) global data assimilation and forecast system. The large-scale budgets of heat and moisture are examined in the analyzed and model atmosphere. The daily operational analyses and forecasts (day 1 through day 5) produced for the summer seasons comprising June, July and August of 1995 and 1993 have been considered for the purpose. The principal aim of the study is two-fold. Primarily, to comprehend the influence of the systematic errors over the Indian summer monsoon, secondarily, to analyze the performance of the model in capturing the interseasonal variability.</p>
					<p>The heat and moisture balances show reduction in the influx of heat and moisture in the model forecasts compared to the analyzed atmosphere over the monsoon domain. Consequently, the diabatic heating also indicates reducing trend with increase in the forecast period. In effect, the strength of Indian summer monsoon, which essentially depends on these parameters, weakens considerably in the model forecasts. Despite producing feeble monsoon circulation, the model captures interseasonal variability realistically. Although, 1995 and 1993 are fairly normal monsoon seasons, the former received more rainfall compared to the latter in certain pockets of the monsoon domain. This is clearly indicated by the analyzed and model atmosphere in terms of energetics.</p>

				<title>Laser microprobe for the study of noble gases and nitrogen in single grains: A case study of individual chondrules from the Dhajala meteorite</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0113-0127</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A laser microprobe capable of analysing nitrogen and noble gases in individual grains with masses less than a milligram is described. It can be used in both continuous wave (CW) mode, useful for stepwise heating of an individual grain, as well as in pulsed mode, useful for ablating material from a small selected area of a sample, for gas extraction. We could achieve low blanks (in ccSTP units) for <sup>4</sup>He (4.8 &#215; 10<sup>-12</sup>), <sup>22</sup>Ne(1.0 &#215; 10<sup>-12</sup>), <sup>36</sup>Ar(1.0 &#215; 10<sup>-13</sup>), <sup>84</sup>Kr(2.9 &#215; 10<sup>-14</sup>), <sup>132</sup>Xe(2.6 &#215; 10<sup>-14</sup>), and N (87 pg), using this system. Preliminary data for individual chondrules from the Dhajala meteorite show that noble gases and nitrogen from grains as small as 170 microgram can be analysed using the present laser microprobe setup. The amount of trapped neon in Dhajala chondrules is very small, and nitrogen in the chondrules is isotopically heavier as compared to the bulk meteorite.</p>

				<title>Some salient features of the atmosphere observed over the north Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0131-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the near surface characteristics and vertical variations based on the observations made at 17.5&#176;N and 89&#176;E from ORV Sagar Kanya in the north Bay of Bengal during the Bay of Bengal Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) carried out in July-August 1999. BOBMEX captured both the active and weak phases of convection. SST remained above the convection threshold  throughout the BOBMEX. While the response of the SST to atmospheric forcing was clearly observed, the response of the atmosphere to SST changes was not clear. SST decreased during periods of large scale precipitation, and increased during a weak phase of convection. It is shown that the latent heat flux at comparable wind speeds was about 25-50% lower over the Bay during BOBMEX compared to that over the Indian Ocean during other seasons and tropical west Pacific. On the other hand, the largest variations in the surface daily net heat flux are observed over the Bay during BOBMEX. SST predicted using observed surface fluxes showed that 1-D heat balance model works sometime but not always, and horizontal advection is important. The high resolution Vaisala radiosondes launched during BOBMEX could clearly bring out the changes in the vertical structure of the atmosphere between active and weak phases of convection. Convective Available Potential Energy of the surface air decreased by 2-3 kJ $kg^{−1}$ following convection, and recovered  in a time period of one or two days. The mid tropospheric relative humidity and water vapor content, and wind direction show the major changes between the active and weak phases of convection.</p>

				<title>A study on the structure of the convective atmosphere over the Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0147-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Convective activity is one of the major processes in the atmosphere influencing the local and large scale weather in the tropics. The latent heat released by the cumulus cloud is known to drive monsoon circulation, which on the other hand supplies the moisture that maintains the cumulus clouds. An investigation is carried out on the convective structure of the atmosphere during active and suppressed periods of convection using data sets obtained from the Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX). The cumulus convection though being a small-scale phenomenon, still influences its embedding environment by interaction through various scales. This study shows the variation in the kinematic and convective parameters during the transition from suppressed to active periods of convection. Convergence in the lower levels and strong upward vertical velocity, significant during active convection are associated with the formation of monsoon depressions. The apparent heat source due to latent heat release and the vertical transport of the eddy heat by cumulus convection, and the apparent moisture sink due to net condensation and vertical divergence of the eddy transport of moisture, are estimated through residuals of the thermodynamic equation and examined in relation to monsoon activity during BOBMEX.</p>

				<title>Circulation characteristics of a monsoon depression during BOBMEX-99 using high-resolution analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0165-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The skill and efficiency of a numerical model mostly varies with the quality of initial values, accuracy on parameterization of physical processes and horizontal and vertical resolution of the model. Commonly used low-resolution reanalyses are hardly able to capture the prominent features associated with organized convective processes in a monsoon depression. The objective is to prepare improved high-resolution analysis by the use of MM5 modelling system developed by the Pennsyl- vania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR). It requires the objective comparison of high and low-resolution analysis datasets in assessing the specific convective features of a monsoon depression. For this purpose, reanalysis datasets of NCAR/NCEP (National Center for Atmospheric Research/National Centers for Environmental Prediction) at a horizontal resolution of 2.5&#176; (latitude/longitude) have been used as first guess in the objective analysis scheme. The additional asynoptic datasets obtained during BOBMEX-99 are utilized within the assimilation process. Cloud Motion Wind (CMW) data of METEOSAT satellite and SSM/I surface wind data are included for the improvement of derived analysis. The multiquadric (MQD) interpolation technique is selected and applied for meteorological objective analysis at a horizontal resolution of 30 km. After a successful inclusion of additional data, the resulting reanalysis is able to produce the structure of convective organization as well as prominent synoptic features associated with monsoon depression. Comparison and error verifications have been done with the help of available upper-air station data. The objective verification reveals the efficiency of the analysis scheme.</p>

				<title>Simulation of Marine Boundary Layer characteristics using a 1-D PBL model over the Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0185-0204</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The characteristic features of the marine boundary layer (MBL) over the Bay of Bengal during the southwest monsoon and the factors influencing it are investigated. The Bay of Bengal and Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) carried out during July-August 1999 is the first observational experiment under the Indian Climate Research Programme (ICRP). A very high-resolution data in the vertical was obtained during this experiment, which was used to study the MBL characteristics off the east coast of India in the north and south Bay of Bengal. Spells of active and suppressed convection over the Bay were observed, of which, three representative convective episodes were considered for the study. For this purpose a one-dimensional multi-level PBL model with a TKE$-𝜀 closure scheme was used. The soundings, viz., the vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, zonal and meridional component of wind, obtained onboard ORV Sagar Kanya and from coastal stations along the east coast are used for the study. The temporal evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, marine boundary layer height (MBLH), sensible and latent heat fluxes and drag coefficient of momentum are simulated for different epochs of monsoon and monsoon depressions during BOBMEX-99.The model also generates the vertical profiles of potential temperature, specific humidity, zonal and meridional wind. These simulated values compared reasonably well with the observations available from BOBMEX.</p>

				<title>Study of total column atmospheric aerosol optical depth, ozone and precipitable water content over Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0205-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The spatial and temporal variations in aerosols and precursor gases over oceanic regions have special importance in the estimation of radiative forcing parameters and thereby in the refinement of general circulation models. Extensive observations of the columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD), total column ozone (TCO) and precipitable water content (PWC) have been carried out using the on-line, multi-band solar radiometers onboard ORV Sagar Kanya (Cruise&#35;SK 147B) over Bay of Bengal during 11th-28th August 1999. Aerosol optical and physical properties (optical depth and angstrom parameter) have been estimated at six wavelengths covering from UV to NIR (380-1020 nm) while TCO and PWC have been determined using the UV band around 300nm and NIR band around 940 nm, respectively. Added, concurrent meteorological and satellite observations during this field phase of BOBMEX-99 have been utilized to investigate spectral-temporal variations of AOD, TCO and PWC in marine environment.</p>
					<p>The results indicate lower AODs (around 0.4 at characteristic wavelength of 500 nm) and size distributions with abundance of coarse-mode particles as compared to those aerosols of typical land origin. An interesting result that is found in the present study is the significant reduction in AOD at all wavelengths from initial to later part of observation period due to cloud-scavenging and rain-washout effects as well as signature of coastal aerosol loading. The clear-sky daytime diurnal variation of TCO shows gradual increase during post-sunrise hours, broad maximum during afternoon hours and gradual decrease during pre-sunset hours, which is considered to be due to photochemical reactions. The diurnal variation curve of PWC showed maximum (∼4cm) during morning hours and gradual decrease (∼3.5cm) towards evening hours, which are found to be greater as compared to typical values over land. Another interesting feature observed is that although the PWC values are very high, there was no proportionate or appreciable enhancement in AOD &#8212; a feature that can be utilized to infer composition of aerosols over the study region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A daily rainfall dataset and the corresponding rainfall maps have been produced by objective analysis of rainfall data. The satellite estimate of rainfall and the raingauge values are merged to form the final analysis. Associated with epochs of monsoon these rainfall maps are able to show the rainfall activities over India and the Bay of Bengal region during the BOBMEX period. The intra-seasonal variations of rainfall during BOBMEX are also seen using these data. This dataset over the oceanic region compares well with other available popular datasets like GPCP and CMAP. Over land this dataset brings out the features of monsoon in more detail due to the availability of more local raingauge stations.</p>

					<p>Analysis of the spatial data collected along two sections of temperature and salinity from Chennai to $13&#176;N and 87&#176;E and back to Chennai onboard INS Sagardhwani during the Bay of Bengal  Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX) from 10th to 20th August 1999 revealed the presence of a prominent cyclonic eddy centered around 280km away from the coast. Analysis of the dissipation rate of the cyclonic eddy from transect one to transect two and from the analysis of the TOPEX data, it may be inferred that the cyclonic eddy is possibly due to the presence of westward propagating Rossby waves in the Bay of Bengal.</p>

					<p>We document the flow features, which are associated with the important synoptic systems that affected the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and its neighbourhood and controlled the convective activity there during BOBMEX. The monsoon during July and August, 1999 was subdued. It was slightly more active in the initial phase of BOBMEX that commenced on 15th July 1999 and continued up to first week of August 1999 but weakened during the second half of August. The convection was accordingly affected, reducing the rainfall over India. There were several active and weak spells of convection over the Bay of Bengal that manifested in five low pressure systems, of which twobecame depressions.</p>

				<title>Observations of wind and waves in the central Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99 and their effect on mixed layer depth variability due to forced mixing</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0255-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time-series wind and wave measurements were carried out onboard INS Sagardhwani in the central Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX-99. Various other marine meteorological and oceanographic measurements relevant to monsoon studies were also collected simultaneously. The observed variations of wind and waves and the associated mixed layer depth (MLD) variability based on both temperature and density criteria at 3 hourly intervals are presented in this paper as a case study. At the time-series location (13&#176;N, 87&#176;E) wind varied between 6 and 16 m/s and the predominant direction was southwesterly. The significant wave height and period varied from 1.9 to 3.7m and 8 to 13 s respectively. Some of the available statistical predictive methods for the determination of MLD by forced mixing are utilized to test the extent of mechanical mixing within the top layer of water by the local wind and wave activity. The same is extended to formulate a new empirical relation for gross estimation of effective depth within which the sound energy is generally trapped during its transmission in the surface duct. The present analysis aiming for estimation of observed MLD variability (35 to 75 m) using the suggested simple empirical relation reveals that, the mixed layer variability observed during the experiment depends on both local ocean variability as well as remote forcing as reported earlier.</p>

				<title>An experimental study of radiative fluxes in the south Bay of Bengal during BOBMEX 1999</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0267-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time series measurements of radiative fluxes were made onboard INS Sagardhwani (SD) in the south Bay of Bengal near DS3 (13&#176;N and 87&#176;E) during the BOBMEX field experiment. An inter- comparison experiment conducted at DS3 showed that the radiative fluxes measured by Kipp and Zonen, Albedo meter and net Pyrgeometer onboard SD and by Eppley radiometers onboard ORV Sagar Kanya (SK) are well matched. It may be mentioned that the measurements showed consistency and good agreement between SD and SK ships, even though no Gimbal mounting was used for radiation instruments onboard SD.</p>
					<p>The main aim of the experiment was collection of high quality radiation data during the monsoon period, which can give an insight into the nature of the ocean-atmosphere coupling. The data on the four radiative fluxes collected on SD are averaged at 5 minute intervals and then hourly and daily averages have been computed. The hourly shortwave albedo and the atmospheric transmission factor are also computed and the variation of albedo in relation to the solar altitude and the transmissivity factor (TF) are studied. The mean albedo over the south Bay of Bengal under clear, partly cloudy and overcast skies are found to be 0.05, 0.07 and 0.2 respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface meteorological parameters acquired during the field phase experiment, BOBMEX-99, for the stationary periods (SP I and II) of the ship ORV Sagar Kanya over Bay of Bengal have been analysed. Active and weak monsoon conditions were observed during the first and the second phase of the experiment respectively over India as well as over the stationary ship location. The phase mean sea surface temperature (SST) is found to be the same in both the phases, however large differences have been observed in the phase mean values of wind speed, mean sea level pressure, latent heat and momentum fluxes at air-sea interface. Synoptic scale monsoon disturbances formed only during the period of strong north-south pressure gradient over the Bay region. Events of prominent fall in SST and in the upper 15m ocean layer mean temperature and salinity values during typical rainfall events are cited. The impact of monsoon disturbances on ocean-atmosphere interface transfer processes has been investigated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Thermodynamic structure of the marine atmosphere in the region between 80 and 87&#176;E along 13&#176;N over the Bay of Bengal was studied using 13 high resolution radiosonde profiles from surface −400 hPa collected onboard ORV Sagar Kanya during the period 27th-30th August, during BOBMEX-99. Saturation point concept, mixing line analysis and conserved variable diagrams have been used to identify boundary layer characteristics such as air mass movement and stability of the atmosphere. The results showed relatively dry air near the ocean surface between 1000 and 950 hPa. This feature is confirmed by the conserved 𝜃<sub>v</sub> structure in this layer. Further, 𝜃<sub>v</sub> seldom showed any inversions in this region. The 𝜃<sub>e</sub> and 𝜃<sub>es</sub> profiles showed persistent low cloud layers between 900 and 700 hPa. The conserved variable diagrams (𝜃<sub>e-q</sub>) showed the existence of double mixing line structures approximately at 950 and 700 hPa levels.</p>

				<title>Flexure of the Indian plate and intraplate earthquakes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0315-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The flexural bulge in central India resulting from India's collision with Tibet has a wavelength of approximately 670 km. It is manifest topographically and in the free-air gravity anomaly and the geoid. Calculations of the stress distribution within a flexed Indian plate reveal spatial variations throughout the depth of the plate and also a function of distance from the Himalaya. The wave- length (and therefore local gradient) of stress variation is a function of the effective elastic thickness of the plate, estimates of which have been proposed to lie in the range 40-120 km. The imposition of this stress field on the northward moving Indian plate appears fundamental to explaining the current distribution of intraplate earthquakes and their mechanisms. The current study highlights an outer trough south of the flexural bulge in central India where surface stresses are double the contiguous compressional stresses to the north and south. The Bhuj, Latur and Koyna earthquakes and numerous other recent reverse faulting events occurred in this compressional setting. The N/S spatial gradient of stress exceeds 2 bars/km near the flexural bulge. The overall flexural stress distribution provides a physical basis for earthquake hazard mapping and suggests that areas of central India where no historic earthquakes are recorded may yet be the locus of future damaging events.</p>

				<title>Pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic displacements associated with the Bhuj 2001 earthquake derived from recent and historic geodetic data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0331-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake occurred in the Kachchh Rift Basin which has a long history of major earthquakes. Great Triangulation Survey points (GTS) were first installed in the area in 1856-60 and some of these were measured using Global Positioning System (GPS) in the months of February and July 2001. Despite uncertainties associated with repairs and possible reconstruction of points in the past century, the re-measurements reveal pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic deformation related to Bhuj earthquake. More than 25 𝜇-<i>strain</i> contraction north of the epicenter appears to have occurred in the past 140 years corresponding to a linear convergence rate of approximately 10 mm/yr across the Rann of Kachchh. Motion of a single point at Jamnagar 150km south of the epicenter in the 4 years prior to the earthquake, and GTS-GPS displacements in Kathiawar suggests that pre-seismic strain south of the epicenter was small and differs insignificantly from  that measured elsewhere in India. Of the 20 points measured within 150km of the epicenter, 12 were made at existing GTS points which revealed epicentral displacements of up to 1m, and strain changes exceeding 30 𝜇-<i>strain</i>. Observed displacements are consistent with reverse co-seismic slip. Re-measurements in July 2001 of one GTS point (Hathria) and eight new points established in February reveal post-seismic deformation consistent with continued slip on the Bhuj rupture zone.</p>

				<title>An eyewitness account of the Bhuj earthquake</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0347-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrence of a severe earthquake is a rare event with its effect localized in a limited region. There are no prior indications of its occurrence too; hence experiencing such an event is just a matter of chance, which the author had by virtue of his posting at Bhuj. This paper presents a detailed account of observations made in the wake of the Bhuj earthquake of January 26th 2001, describing physical and mental reactions during the earthquake, the post-quake scenario, the nature and cause of damage to buildings, the trend of aftershocks, various deformities, including ruptures and fissures on the surface of the earth, etc. which may be useful for a detailed study of the seismological activity in the region.</p>

				<title>A media-based assessment of damage and ground motions from the January 26th, 2001 M7.6 Bhuj, India earthquake</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0353-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compiled available news and internet accounts of damage and other effects from the 26th January, 2001, Bhuj earthquake, and interpreted them to obtain modified Mercalli intensities at over 200 locations throughout the Indian subcontinent. These values are used to map the intensity distribution using a simple mathematical interpolation method. The maps reveal several interesting features. Within the Kachchh region, the most heavily damaged villages are concentrated towards the western edge of the inferred fault, consistent with western directivity. Significant sediment- induced amplification is also suggested at a number of locations around the Gulf of Kachchh to the south of the epicenter. Away from the Kachchh region intensities were clearly amplified significantly in areas that are along rivers, within deltas, or on coastal alluvium such as mud flats and salt pans. In addition we use fault rupture parameters inferred from teleseismic data to predict shaking intensity at distances of 0-1000 km. We then convert the predicted hard rock ground motion parameters to MMI using a relationship (derived from internet-based intensity surveys) that assigns MMI based on the average effects in a region. The predicted MMIs are typically lower by 1-2 units than those estimated from news accounts. This discrepancy is generally consistent with the expected effect of sediment response, but it could also reflect other factors such as a tendency for media accounts to focus on the most dramatic damage, rather than the average effects. Our modeling results also suggest, however, that the Bhuj earthquake generated more high-frequency shaking than is expected for earthquakes of similar magnitude in California, and may therefore have been especially damaging.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Damage observed during the Kutch earthquake of 26th January 2001 is classified according to the type of structure. This damage pattern has been used to draw the isoseismal map on the basis of the intensity scale given in IS 1893-2002 which covers only traditional one to two storey houses. Having thus estimated intensities, and observed damage to other types of structures, a new criterion was adopted which is included in this paper. Areas that showed maximum damage to structures have been assigned maximum intensity X.</p>

				<title>Aftershocks of 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake and seismotectonics of the Kutch region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0385-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake was followed by intense aftershock activity. Aftershock data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) utilized in this study encompasses three months period from 26th January to 26th April 2001. Epicenters of the aftershock are plotted on a map depicting active faults. All the aftershocks of magnitude &gt; 5 and 70% of those ranging between magnitude 3 and 5 are confined to an area resembling a horseshoe pattern with a pointed end towards NE. The other 20% of magnitude 3 to 5 are enclosed within an almost parallel boundary. Only 10% are found to be beyond this limiting boundary. 50% of the recorded aftershocks took place within the first week of the main event and this study reveals that the basic characteristic pattern of aftershock activity can be determined on the basis of the data of only one week.</p>
					<p>Four major NW-SE trending active faults are mapped in the Kutch region. They define the western limit of Cambay structure and also mark the western limit of Dharangadhra and Wadhwan basins along the SE continuation in Saurashtra. These faults separate the Kutch region into two geologically different blocks. On the SW side the mapped horseshoe pattern gets characteristically truncated along the western most fault, which is characterized by a strike-slip movement in the south and vertical movement in the north. The present study has revealed that the epicenter of the 26th January earthquake is located in the vicinity of the Bhachau township, close to the intersection with the Kutch mainland fault. Furthermore, it has been noticed that most of the epicenters of the aftershock are confined in the intersectional area of the Kutch mainland fault and the NW-SE faults.</p>

				<title>Aftershock activity of Bhuj earthquake of January 26th, 2001</title>

				<page>0391-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Following a large-sized Bhuj earthquake ($M_s = 7.6$) of January 26th, 2001, a small aperture 4- station temporary local network was deployed, in the epicentral area, for a period of about three weeks and resulted in the recording of more than 1800 aftershocks ($-0.07 \leq M_L$ &lt; 5.0). Preliminary locations of epicenters of 297 aftershocks ($2.0 \leq M_L$ &lt; 5.0) have brought out a dense cluster of aftershock activity, the center of which falls 20km NW of Bhachau. Epicentral locations of after-shocks encompass a surface area of about 50 &#215; 40km<sup>2</sup> that seems to indicate the surface projection of the rupture area associated with the earthquake. The distribution of aftershock activity above magnitude 3, shows that aftershocks are nonuniformly distributed and are aligned in the north, northwest and northeast directions. The epicenter of the mainshock falls on the southern edge of the delineated zone of aftershock activity and the maximum clustering of activity occurs in close proximity of the mainshock. Well-constrained focal depths of 122 aftershocks show that 89% of the aftershocks occurred at depths ranging between 6 and 25km and only 7% and 4% aftershocks occur at depths less than 5 and more than 25km respectively. The Gutenberg-Richter (GR) relationship, log $N = 4.52-0.89 M_L$, is fitted to the aftershock data ($1.0 \leq M_L$ &lt; 5.0) and the 𝑏-value of 0.89 has been estimated for the aftershock activity.</p>

					<p>A study of 531 aftershocks, in the magnitude range of 3.0-5.7, recorded at Vadodara Seismological Observatory till March 31st, 2001 has been carried out and various statistical parameters calculated. The total energy released during the study period is calculated to be 8.2 &#215; 10<sup>14</sup> joule. Sudden occurrence of the main shock without any foreshock in the same tectonic system is a unique feature of this sequence. The 𝑏-value (0.86), value of $M_0-M_1$ (1.2), high $M_1/M_0$ (0.89) and high value of the decay constant ℎ (0.91), all support the tectonic origin of the present study.</p>

				<title>Study of the epicentral trends and depth sections for aftershocks of the 26th January 2001, Bhuj earthquake in western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0401-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Geological Survey of India (GSI) established a twelve-station temporary microearthquake (MEQ) network to monitor the aftershocks in the epicenter area of the Bhuj earthquake ($M_w7.5$) of 26th January 2001. The main shock occurred in the Kutch rift basin with the epicenter to the north of Bhachao village, at an estimated depth of 25km (IMD). About 3000 aftershocks ($M_d \geq 1.0$), were recorded by the GSI network over a monitoring period of about two and half months from 29th  January 2001 to 15th April 2001. About 800 aftershocks ($M_d \geq 2.0$) are located in this study. The epicenters are clustered in an area 60km &#215; 30km, between 23.3&#176;N and 23.6&#176;N and 70&#176;E and 70.6&#176;E. The main shock epicenter is also located within this zone.</p>
					<p>Two major aftershock trends are observed; one in the NE direction and other in the NW direction. Out of these two trends, the NE trend was more pronounced with depth. The major NE-SW trend is parallel to the Anjar-Rapar lineament. The other trend along NW-SE is parallel to the Bhachao lineament. The aftershocks at a shallower depth (&lt; 10 km) are aligned only along the NW-SE direction. The depth slice at 10km to 20km shows both the NE-SW trend and the NW-SE trend. At greater depth (20 km{38 km) the NE-SW trend becomes more predominant. This observation suggests that the major rupture of the main shock took place at a depth level more than 20 km; it propagated along the NE-SW direction, and a conjugate rupture followed the NW-SE direction.</p>
					<p>A N-S depth section of the aftershocks shows that some aftershocks are clustered at shallower depth &#8804; 10km, but intense activity is observed at 15-38km depth. There is almost an aseismic layer at 10-15km depth. The activity is sparse below 38 km. The estimated depth of the main shock at 25km is consistent with the cluster of maximum number of the aftershocks at 20-38 km. A NW-SE depth section of the aftershocks, perpendicular to the major NE-SW trend, indicates a SE dipping plane and a NE-SW depth section across the NW-SE trend shows a SW dipping plane.</p>
					<p>The epicentral map of the stronger aftershocks 𝑀 &#8805; 4.0 shows a prominent NE trend. Stronger aftershocks have followed the major rupture trend of the main shock. The depth section of these stronger aftershocks reveals that it occurred in the depth range of 20 to 38 km, and corroborates with a south dipping seismogenic plane.</p>

				<title>Fault plane solutions of the January 26th, 2001 Bhuj earthquake sequence</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0413-0419</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 12-station temporary microearthquake network was established by the Geological Survey of India for aftershock monitoring of the January 26th, 2001 Bhuj earthquake ($M_W$ 7.6) in the Kutch district of Gujarat state, western India. The epicentres of the aftershocks show two major trends: one in the NE direction and the other in the NW direction. Fault-plane solutions of the best- located and selected cluster of events that occurred along the NE trend, at a depth of 15-38 km, show reverse faulting with a large left-lateral strike-slip motion, which are comparable with the main-shock solution. The NW trending upper crustal aftershocks at depth &lt; 10 km, on the other hand, show reverse faulting with right-lateral strike-slip motion, and the mid crustal and lower crustal aftershocks, at a depth of 15-38 km, show pure reverse faulting as well as reverse faulting with right-lateral and left-lateral strike-slip motions; these solutions are not comparable with the main-shock solution. It is inferred that the intersection of two faults has been the source area for stress concentration to generate the main shock and the aftershocks.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0421-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The current designs of supporting structures of elevated water tanks are extremely vulnerable under lateral forces due to an earthquake and the Bhuj earthquake provided another illustration when a great many water tank stagings suffered damage and a few collapsed. The more popular shaft type stagings suffer from poor ductility of thin shell sections besides low redundancy and toughness whereas framed stagings consist of weak members and poor brace-column joints. A strength analysis of a few damaged shaft type stagings clearly shows that all of them either met or exceeded the strength requirements of IS:1893-1984, however, they were all found deficient when compared with requirements of the International Building Code. IS:1893-1984 is unjustifiably low for these systems which do not have the advantage of ductility and redundancy and are currently being underestimated at least by a factor of 3 and need an upward revision of forces immediately.</p>

				<title>Behaviour of masonry structures during the Bhuj earthquake of January 2001</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0431-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A variety of masonry structures suffered damage during the recent Bhuj earthquake. Some of the traditional masonry structures had no earthquake resistant features and suffered considerable damage. This paper attempts to evaluate the behaviour of masonry structures based on the type of masonry used in places like Bhuj, Anjar, Bhachau, Morbi, Samakhyali and several other places. Quite a few masonry buildings had used earthquake resistant features like lintel bands and corner reinforcements. The cracking and failure patterns of such buildings have also been examined. The paper concludes with a discussion on the relevance of the current codal provisions for earthquake resistance of masonry structures and the direction of further research in the area.</p>

				<title>Estimation of S-wave site response in and around Delhi region from weak motion data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0441-0462</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Site response in and around Delhi is studied using digital seismograms recorded by a thirteen-station VSAT-based 24-bit digital Delhi telemetry network of the India Meteorological Department. Nine local ($M_l \geq 2.3$) and nine regional ($M_l \geq 3.9$) earthquakes are selected for the estimation of site amplification factor using the classical standard spectral ratio for regional events (Ridge Delhi Observatory being the reference station), normalized standard spectral ratio for local events, horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio or receiver function and the generalized inversion techniques in the frequency range of 0.5 to 7.5 Hz. Site response curves at all the thirteen stations exhibit station to station variation of the site amplification factor reflecting the changes in geologic/geotectonic/soil conditions. A comparison of the site response values obtained by the generalized inversion with those computed using receiver function technique shows a large scatter even though the pattern of the curves remain more or less similar. However, the site effects computed by generalized inversion and standard spectral ratio exhibit a good 1:1 correspondence. The peaks yielded by all the methods have been observed to occur at the same frequencies. It is evident that the softer fluvial deposits of the newer alluvium of the east Yamuna sector show steeper site amplification gradient at lower frequencies, while the greater Delhi experiences moderate site amplification. The variation of site response corroborates the abrupt changes in intensity from one location to another due to local site condition.</p>

				<title>2.5D Simulation of basin-edge effects on the ground motion characteristics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0463-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of basin-edge and soil velocity on the ground motion characteristics have been simulated using 2.5D modeling. One of the most significant advantages of the 2.5D simulation is that 3D radiation pattern can be generated in a 2D numerical grid using double-couple shear dislocation source. Further, 2.5D numerical modeling avoids the extensive computational cost of 3D modeling. The responses of basin-edge model using different soil velocities revealed that surface waves were generated near the edge of the basin and propagated normal to the edge, towards the basin. Further, the results depict increase of amplification, duration and surface wave generation with the decrease in soil velocity.</p>

				<page>0471-0477</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Bhuj earthquake of January 26th, 2001, induced wide spread liquefaction within the Kachch peninsula. It has been pointed out that inundation due to soil liquefaction was short lived in some parts than in others in the affected region. Several geological, seismological and hydrological factors would have cumulatively contributed to these observed changes.</p>
					<p>We simulate in this article, undrained or short-term change in pore pressure in a poroelastic half space, in response to a simplified model of the Bhuj earthquake source. We find that the regions of relatively shorter lived inundation due to soil liquefaction may fall in the region where pore pressure responsible for soil liquefaction attributable to strong ground shaking was counteracted by pore pressure changes due to undrained poroelastic effect and vice versa.</p>

				<title>Determination of rare earth and refractory trace element abundances in early solar system objects by ion microprobe</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0485-0498</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experimental and analytical procedures devised for measurement of rare earth element (REE)  abundances using a secondary ion mass spectrometer (ion microprobe) are described. This approach is more versatile than the conventional techniques such as neutron activation analysis and isotope dilution mass spectrometry by virtue of its high spatial resolution that allows determination of REE abundances in small domains (10-20 micron) within individual mineral phases. The ion microprobe measurements are performed at a low mass-resolving power adopting the energy-filltering technique (Zinner and Crozaz 1986) for removal and suppression of unresolved complex molecular interferences in the REE masses of interest. Synthetic standards are used for determining various instrument specific parameters needed in the data deconvolution procedure adopted for obtaining  REE abundances. Results obtained from analysis of standards show that our ion microprobe may be used for determining REE abundances down to ppm range with uncertainties of ∼10 to 15%. Abundances of rare earth and several other refractory trace elements in a set of early solar system objects isolated from two primitive carbonaceous chondrites were determined using the procedures devised by us. The results suggest that some of these objects could be high temperature nebular condensates, while others are products of melting and recrystallization of precursor nebular solids in a high temperature environment.</p>

				<title>Prediction of monsoon rainfall with a nested grid mesoscale limited area model</title>

				<page>0499-0519</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At the India Meteorological Department (IMD), New Delhi, a 12-level limited area model with 100km horizontal resolution has been in use for weather forecasting. The present study uses this model together with a higher horizontal resolution (50 km) and vertical resolution (16-levels) model to examine the impact of increased resolution to simulate mesoscale features of rainfall during monsoon disturbances. The model was run for 22 days in the month of August 1997 and one week in September 1997 during three monsoon depressions and one cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal. The model results are compared with observations. The study shows that the model can capture mesoscale convective organization associated with monsoon depression.</p>

				<title>Indian monsoon variability in relation to Regional Pressure Index</title>

				<page>0521-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper Regional Pressure Index (RPI) over the Indian region (20&#176;N-40&#176;N and 70&#176;E-85&#176;E) has been constructed for 101 years (1899-1999) on a monthly scale. The relationship of these indices was carried out with the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (June-September) (ISMR) over the various homogeneous regions, for all the time scales. From the analysis it has been seen that RPI in the month of May is significantly associated with ISMR over various regions on all the scales. The relationship is statistically significant at 1% level. The study reveals that RPI in the month of May and January will be a new precursor for the long range forecasting of ISMR on the smaller spatial scale. On the decadal and climatological scale, winter and spring time RPI show a significant inverse relationship with the rainfall over the regions Peninsular India (PI) and North West India (NWI), while the association is direct with Central North East India (CNEI) and North East India (NEI). The relationship is significant at 0.1 and 1% level respectively.</p>

				<title>On breaks of the Indian monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0529-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For over a century, the term break has been used for spells in which the rainfall over the Indian monsoon zone is interrupted. The phenomenon of `break monsoon' is of great interest because long intense breaks are often associated with poor monsoon seasons. Such breaks have distinct circulation characteristics (heat trough type circulation) and have a large impact on rainfed agriculture.Although interruption of the monsoon rainfall is considered to be the most important feature of the break monsoon, traditionally breaks have been identified on the basis of the surface pressure and wind patterns over the Indian region. We have defined breaks (and active spells) on the basis of rainfall over the monsoon zone. The rainfall criteria are chosen so as to ensure a large overlap with the traditional breaks documented by Ramamurthy (1969) and De <i>et al</i> (1998). We have identified these rainbreaks for 1901-89. We have also identified active spells on the basis of rainfall over the Indian monsoon zone. We have shown that the all-India summer monsoon rainfall is significantly negatively correlated with the number of rainbreak days (correlation coefficient −0.56) and significantly positively correlated with the number of active days (correlation coefficient 0.47).Thus the interannual variation of the all-India summer monsoon rainfall is shown to be related to the number of days of rainbreaks and active spells identified here.</p>
					<p>There have been several studies of breaks (and also active spells in several cases) identified on the basis of different criteria over regions differing in spatial scales (e.g., Webster <i>et al</i> 1998; Krishnan <i>et al</i> 2000; Goswami and Mohan 2000; and Annamalai and Slingo 2001). We find that there is considerable overlap between the rainbreaks we have identified and breaks based on the traditional definition. There is some overlap with the breaks identified by Krishnan <i>et al</i> (2000) but little overlap with breaks identified by Webster <i>et al</i> (1998). Further, there are three or four active-break cycles in a season according to Webster <i>et al</i> (1998) which implies a time scale of about 40 days for which Goswami and Mohan (2000), and Annamalai and Slingo (2001) have studied breaks and active minus break fluctuations. On the other hand, neither the traditional breaks (Ramamurthy 1969; and De <i>et al</i> 1998) nor the rainbreaks occur every year. This suggests that the `breaks' in these studies are weak spells of the intraseasonal variation of the monsoon, which occur every year.</p>
					<p>We have derived the OLR and circulation patterns associated with rainbreaks and active spells and compared them with the patterns associated with breaks/active minus break spells from these studies. Inspite of differences in the patterns over the Indian region, there is one feature which is seen in the OLR anomaly patterns of breaks identified on the basis of different criteria as well as the rainbreaks identified in this paper viz., a quadrapole over the Asia-west Pacific region arising from anomalies opposite (same) in sign to those over the Indian region occurring over the equatorial Indian Ocean and northern tropical (equatorial) parts of the west Pacific. Thus it appears that this quadrapole is a basic feature of weak spells of the intraseasonal variation over the Asia-west Pacific region. Since the rainbreaks are intense weak spells, this basic feature is also seen in the composite patterns of these breaks. We find that rainbreaks (active spells) are also associated with negative (positive) anomalies over a part of the east Pacific suggesting that the convection over the Indian region is linked to that over the east Pacific not only on the interannual scale (as evinced by the link between the Indian summer monsoon rainfall and ENSO) but on the intraseasonal scale as well. </p>

				<title>Ion acoustic instability of HPT particles, FAC density, anomalous resistivity and parallel electric field in the auroral region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0559-0567</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the magnetic storm of 21st March 1990, the DE-1 spacecraft encountered the auroral region at high invariant latitude at altitudes ranging from a few thousand kilometers in the ionosphere to many earth radii in the magnetosphere. The magnetic field perturbations interpretable as field aligned current (FAC) layers and the electrostatic turbulence possibly due to electrostatic ion acoustic instability driven by these currents are shown. The critical drift velocity of Hot Plasma Torus (HPT) electrons and the growth rate of ion acoustic wave as a function of electron to ion temperature ratio ($T_e/T_i$) for low and high current densities and energy of HPT electrons are found out. The intense FAC destabilizes the ion acoustic wave and the resultant electrostatic turbulence creates an anomalous resistivity. The current driven resistivity produces parallel electric field and high power dissipation. The anomalous resistivity $\eta $, potential differnece along the auroral field lines $V_\parallel$, intensity of electric field turbulence $E_\parallel$ and power produced per unit volume $P$ are computed. It is found that the change in westward magnetic perturbation increases $J_\parallel; \eta; V_\parallel ;E_\parallel$ and $P$. Hence HPT electrons are heated and accelerated due to power dissipation during magnetically active periods in the auroral region. Concerning, applications, such HPT electrons can be used in particle accelerators like electron ring accelerator, smokatron etc.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Coda $Q(Q_c)$ estimates for the Kumaun Himalaya region have been obtained in high frequency range. Local earthquakes, recorded by a digital seismic network in the region, which fall in the epicentral distances range of 10 to 80km and with a local magnitude range of 1.4 to 2.8, have been used. The coda waves of 30 sec window length, filtered at seven frequency bands centered at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 Hz, have been analysed using the single backscattering model. The values of $Q_c$ estimates vary from 65 to 283 at 1.5 Hz to 2119 to 3279 at 24.0 Hz which showed that $Q_c$ is frequency dependent and its value increases as frequency increases.</p>
					<p>A frequency-dependent $Q_c$ relationship, $Q_c$ = (92 ± 4.73)$f^{(1.07 \pm .023)}$, is obtained for the region  representing the average attenuation characteristics of seismic waves for Kumaun Himalaya region.</p>

				<title>Structural appraisal of the Gadag schist belt from gravity investigations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0577-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Semi-detailed gravity investigations were carried out over an area of approximately 2750 sq km with maximum N-S and E-W extents of 55 and 50km respectively in the Gadag region in the Dharwar craton with a view to obtain a clearer perception of the structural configuration of the region.</p>
					<p>From qualitative analysis of the gravity data, several tectonic features are inferred: the high density Gadag schist belt is characterized by a gravity high and occurs in two discontinuous segments &#8212; the main N-S trending segment, and its thinner NW-SE trending extension, the two separated by a NE-SW trending deep seated fault. While the N-S trend of the Gadag schist belt is bounded on its east by the NW-SE trending Chitradurga thrust fault and on its west by another major NNW-SSE trending fault, the NW-SE extension is likewise bounded by two other NW-SE major faults.</p>
					<p>Quantitative evaluation from forward modeling/inversion of five profiles in the region, assuming a density contrast of 0.29 gm/cc of the anomalous schistose body with the gneissic host rocks indicated a synclinal structure plunging to the southeast along its axis for the Gadag schist belt. The maximum width and depth from surface of the schist belt are 22km and 5.6km respectively.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Closed form analytical expressions of stresses and displacements at any field point due to a very long dip-slip fault of finite width buried in a homogeneous, isotropic elastic half-space, are presented. Airy stress function is used to derive the expressions of stresses and displacements which depend on the dip angle and depth of the upper edge of the fault. The effect of dip angle and depth of the upper edge of the fault on stresses and displacements is studied numerically and the results obtained are presented graphically. Contour maps for stresses and displacements are also presented. The results of Rani and Singh (1992b) and Freund and Barnett (1976) have been reproduced.</p>

				<title>Physical properties of aerosols at Maitri, Antarctica</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of the submicron aerosol size distribution made at the Indian Antarctic station, Maitri (70&#176; 45&#8242;S, 11&#176; 44&#8242;E) from January 10th to February 24th, 1997, are reported. Total aerosol concentrations normally range from 800 to 1200 particles cm<sup>-3</sup> which are typical values for the coastal stations at Antarctica in summer. Aerosol size distributions are generally trimodal and open- ended with a peak between 75 and 133nm and two minima at 42 and 420 nm. Size distributions remain almost similar for several hours or even days in absence of any meteorological disturbance. Total aerosol concentration increases by approximately an order of magnitude whenever a low pressure system passes over the station. Based on the evolution of aerosol size-distributions during such aerosol enhancement periods, three types of cases have been identified. The nucleation mode in all three cases has been suggested to result from the photochemical conversion of the DMS emissions transported either by the marine air or by the air from the ice-melt regions around Maitri. Subsidence of midtropospheric air during the weakening of radiative inversion is suggested as a possible source of the nucleation mode particles in the third case. Growth of the nucleation mode particles by condensation, coagulation and/or by cloud processes has been suggested to be responsible for other modes in size distributions.</p>

				<title>Isotopic evidence of Middle Proterozoic magmatism from Bombay High Field: Implications to crustal evolution of western offshore of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0027-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Precambrian granitic basement rocks obtained from well BH-36 of Bombay High Field, western offshore of India has been studied both by Rb-Sr and K-Ar dating methods. Seven basement samples chosen from two cores have yielded whole rock Rb-Sr isochron age of 1446 ± 67Ma with an initial <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio of 0.7062 ± 0.0012. This age has been interpreted as the formation/emplacement time of the granite. Two biotite fractions of different grain size separated from a sample CC6B2T have yielded Rb-Sr mineral isochron age of 1385 ± 21 Ma. However, these fractions when studied by K-Ar dating method have yielded slightly higher but mutually consistent ages of 1458 ± 43Ma and 1465 ± 43Ma, respectively.</p>
					<p>Further, two biotites separated from additional samples CC5B9T and CC6B3B have yielded K-Ar ages of 1452 ± 42Ma and 1425 ± 40Ma with an overall mean age of 1438 ± 19Ma. This mean K-Ar age is indistinguishable from whole rock Rb-Sr isochron as well as mineral isochron age within experimental error. The similarity in the whole rock and biotite ages obtained by different isotopic methods suggests that no thermal disturbance has occurred in these rocks after their emplacement/formation around 1450Ma ago. The present study provides the evidence for the existence of an important Middle Proterozoic magmatic event around 1400-1450Ma on the  western offshore of India which, hitherto, was thought to be mainly confined to the eastern Ghats, Satpura and Delhi fold belt of India. This finding may have an important bearing on the reconstruction of Proterozoic crustal evolution of western Indian shield.</p>

				<title>Alkaline intrusion in a granulite ensemble in the Eastern Ghats belt, India: Shear zone pathway and a pull-apart structure</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0037-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The alkaline complex of Koraput, Orissa, India, is one of several bodies in the high-grade Eastern Ghats belt, but this one is an integral part of the high-grade belt and remote from the western boundary against the Bastar craton. The Koraput complex forms a lozenge-shaped intrusion into the metapelitic granulites and is bounded by shear zones. The combined effect of movement along these shear zones, is a northeasterly elongated sygmoidal cavity with maximum width along the northwesterly trending Reidel shear. Thus the Koraput alkaline complex can be considered to have been emplaced in a pull-apart structure, developed in the granulitic country rocks. Moreover, in view of the fact that the western margin of the high-grade Eastern Ghats belt bears clear evidence of collisional features, rather than that of rifting or break-up, the rift-valley model for the alkaline magmatism in this high-grade belt appears untenable.</p>

				<title>A direct inversion scheme for deep resistivity sounding data using artificial neural networks</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0049-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Initialization of model parameters is crucial in the conventional 1D inversion of DC electrical data, since a poor guess may result in undesired parameter estimations. In the present work, we investigate the performance of neural networks in the direct inversion of DC sounding data, without the need of a <i>priori</i> information. We introduce a two-step network approach where the first network identifies the curve type, followed by the model parameter estimation using the second network. This approach provides the flexibility to accommodate all the characteristic sounding curve types with a wide range of resistivity and thickness. Here we realize a three layer feed-forward neural network with fast back propagation learning algorithms performing well. The basic data sets for training and testing were simulated on the basis of available deep resistivity sounding (DRS) data from the crystalline terrains of south India. The optimum network parameters and performance were decided as a function of the testing error convergence with respect to the network training error. On adequate training, the final weights simulate faithfully to recover resistivity and thickness on new data. The small discrepancies noticed, however, are well within the resolvability of resistivity sounding curve interpretations.</p>

				<title>Artificial neural network approach for estimation of surface specific humidity and air temperature using Multifrequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0089-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microwave sensor MSMR (Multifrequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer) data onboard Oceansat-1 was used for retrieval of monthly averages of near surface specific humidity ($Q_a$) and air temperature ($T_a$) by means of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The MSMR measures the microwave radiances in 8 channels at frequencies of 6.6, 10.7, 18 and 21 GHz for both vertical and horizontal polarizations.</p>
					<p>The artificial neural networks (ANN) technique is employed to find the transfer function relating the input MSMR observed brightness temperatures and output ($Q_a$ and $T_a$) parameters. Input data consist of nearly 28 months (June 1999 &#8212; September 2001) of monthly averages of MSMR observed brightness temperature and surface marine observations of $Q_a$ and $T_a$ from Comprehensive Ocean- Atmosphere Data Set (COADS).</p>
					<p>The performance of the algorithm is assessed with independent surface marine observations. The results indicate that the combination of MSMR observed brightness temperatures as input parameters provides reasonable estimates of monthly averaged surface parameters. The global root mean square (rms) differences are 1.0&#176;C and $1.1 g kg^{−1}$ for air temperature and surface specific humidity respectively.</p>

				<title>Remote sensing of spectral signatures of tropospheric aerosols</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0103-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With the launch of the German Aerospace Agency's (DLR) Modular Opto-electronic Scanner (MOS) sensor on board the Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS-P3) launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in March 1996, 13 channel multi-spectral data in the range of 408 to 1010nm at high radiometric resolution, precision, and with narrow spectral bands have been available for a variety of land, atmospheric and oceanic studies. We found that these data are best for validation of radiative transfer model and the corresponding code developed by one of  the authors at Space Applications Centre, and called ATMRAD (abbreviated for ATMospheric RADi-ation). Once this model/code is validated, it can be used for retrieving information on tropospheric aerosols over ocean or land. This paper deals with two clear objectives, viz.,</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Validation  of ATMRAD model/code using MOS data and synchronously measured atmospheric data, and if found performing well, then to</li>
						<li>derive relationship between MOS radiances and Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The data validation procedure essentially involves</p>
					<ul>
						<li>near-synchronous measurements of columnar aerosol optical thickness and altitude profiles of aerosol concentration using ground-based multi-filter solar radiometers and Argon-ion Lidar, respectively and</li>
						<li>computation of the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiances from a low reflecting target (near clear water reservoir in the present study) using the ATMRAD model.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The results show that the model performance is satisfactory and a relationship between the spectral parameters of MOS radiances and aerosol optical thickness can be established. In this communication, we present the details of the experiments conducted, database, validation of the ATMRAD model and development of the relationship between AOT and MOS radiance.</p>

				<title>Estimation of spectral reflectance of snow from IRS-1D LISS-III sensor over the Himalayan terrain</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0117-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Marine and Water Resources Group, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, 380 015, India. The sensor onboard the satellite views the earth as a plain surface and consequently the satellite obtained spectral radiances cannot represent true values over a mountainous terrain. The relative magnitudes of terrain slope and its aspect with respect to the sun's position will determine the amount of direct solar radiation incident on an undulating surface. Estimation of spectral reflectance from satellite data forms an important component in many of the snow and glacier studies. The spectral reflectance of snow is influenced by its various parameters. The changes in snowpack characteristics as a result of various metamorphic processes, with age, can cause variations in its spectral reflectances. Since, the terrain geometry also modifies the amount of reflected radiation from a rugged surface, one has to correct the estimated spectral reflectances for terrain topography so as to use them in deriving the snowpack characteristics accurately. Also, the amounts of melt runoff originating from glaciers having different slopes and orientations will not be the same. Considering these aspects, a model has been developed to estimate the terrain corrected spectral reflectances over the Himalayan terrain using the Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III data of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite. The model computes spectral reflectances from satellite based radiance measurements and includes the effect of the terrain topography on the incident solar radiation. The terrain slope and its aspect are generated from the digital elevation model of the region.</p>
					<p>The analysis carried out over the Beas Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India, indicated a variation of 22% in the amount of incident solar radiation for an increase of 10&#176; in terrain slope. Further, the terrain with south-east aspect received maximum amount of solar radiation. The large differences observed between the uncorrected and terrain corrected reflectances in the shortwave infrared band (B5), which is not saturated over the snow covered region, suggest that the terrain slope and its aspect cannot be neglected in estimating the accurate spectral reflectances over the Himalayan terrain.</p>

				<title>The evaporation of the charged and uncharged water drops suspended in a wind tunnel</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0129-0138</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A laboratory experiment has been performed to study the effect of ventilation on the rate of evaporation of the millimeter sized charged and uncharged water drops suspended in a vertical wind tunnel. The linear relationship, $f_v = 0.907 + 0.282 X$, observed between the mean ventilation coefficient, $f_v$, and a non-dimensional parameter 𝑋, ($X =N^{1/3}_{Sc,v} N^{1/2}_{Re}$ where $N_{Sc,v}$ is Schmidt number and $N_{Re}$ is Reynold's number) is in agreement with the results of earlier investigations for uncharged water drops. However, in case of charged drops carrying $10^{−10}C$ of charge, this relationship gets modified to $ $f_v = 0.4877 + 0.149X$. Thus, the rate of evaporation of charged drops is slower than that of uncharged drops of the same size. Oscillations of the drop and the change in airflow around drops are suggested to contribute to lowering of the ventilation coefficients for charged drops. Applicability of the results to a small fraction of highly charged raindrops falling through the sub-cloud layer below thunderstorm is discussed. The relaxation time required for a ventilated drop to reach its equilibrium temperature increases with the drop size and is higher for  the charged than for the uncharged drops. It is concluded that in a given distance, charged drops will evaporate less than that of uncharged drops.</p>

				<title>Intra-Seasonal Oscillation (ISO) of south Kerala rainfall during the summer monsoons of 1901-1995</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0139-0150</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time series of daily averaged rainfall of about 40 rain gauge stations of south Kerala, situated at the southern-most part of peninsular India between latitudes about 8&#176;N and 10&#176;N were subjected to Wavelet Analysis to study the Intra Seasonal Oscillation (ISO) in the rainfall and its interannual variability. Of the 128 days, 29th May to 3rd October of each of the 95 years 1901-1995 were analysed. We find that the period of ISO does not vary during a monsoon season in most of the years, but it has large inter-annual variability in the range 23 to 64 days. Period-wise, the years cluster into two groups of ISO, the SHORT consisting of periods 23, 27 and 32 days and the LONG with a single period of 64 days, both the sets at a significance level of 99%. During the 95 years at this level of significance there are 44 years with SHORT and 20 years with LONG periods. 11 years have no ISO even at the 90% level of significance.</p>
					<p>We composited NCEP SST anomalies of the summer monsoon season June to September for two groups of years during the period 1965-1993. The first group is of 5 years with a LONG ISO period of 64 days for south Kerala rainfall at significance level of 99% and the second group is of 12 years with SHORT ISO periods of 23, 27 and 32 days at the same level of significance. The SST anomaly for the LONG (SHORT) ISO resembles that for an El Nino (La Nina).</p>

				<title>Tropical systematic and random error energetics based on NCEP (MRF) analysis- forecast system - A barotropic approach <i>Part I: in physical domain</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0151-0166</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deterministic predictability in the perspective of systematic and random error and their growth rates and different components of growth rate budgets like flux, pure generation, mixed generation and conversion in energy/variance form are investigated in physical domain for medium range tropical (30&#176; S-30&#176;N) weather forecast using daily horizontal wind field at 850 hPa up to 5-day forecast for the month of June, 2000 of NCEP (MRF) model.</p>
					<p>The study reveals the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Indian peninsula, the Indonesian region and their adjoining areas over 10&#176;N-20&#176;N latitudinal belt show a large amount of forecast error variance indicating that cumulus parameterization process may play a major role in the generation of tropical systematic error.</li>
						<li>Sparse observational networks over the tropical region are attributed to the uniform spread of random error over the continental as well as oceanic area. The results suggest that generation of random error in some geographical locations is perhaps due to the inefficient description of sensible heating process in the model.</li>
						<li>As far as growth rates are concerned, systematic error growth rate increases at initial forecast time and attains maximum value at 2-day forecast then it remains unchanged for rest of the forecast days. Whereas, the growth rate of random error is nearly invariant at 1 and 2-day forecasts and then it increases slowly at subsequent forecast time.</li>
						<li> Analyzing the flux, pure generation, mixed generation and conversion terms involved with the components of systematic and random error growth rate budget, it is shown that the components have their large variance in those regions where the respective error predominates.</li>

				<title>Tropical systematic and random error energetics based on NCEP (MRF) analysis- forecast system - A barotropic approach <i>Part II: in wavenumber domain</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0167-0195</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Systematic and random error and their growth rate and different components of growth rate budget in energy/variance form are investigated at wavenumber domain for medium range tropical (30&#176;S-30&#176;N) weather forecast using daily horizontal wind field of 850 hPa up to 5-day forecast for the month of June, 2000 of NCEP (MRF) model. Part I of this paper deals with the study at physical domain.</p>
					<p>The following are the major findings in this paper:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tropical systematic error is associated with large scale wave of wavenumber 2, unlike the tropical random error, in which case dominant spectra of random error are observed at higher spectral band of wavenumbers 4 - 7 in comparison to that of systematic error.</li>
						<li>Systematic error growth rate peak is observed at wavenumber 2 up to 4-day forecast then the peak is shifted to wavenumber 1 at 5-day forecast. Random error energy shows maximum growth at wavenumber 4 for 2-day forecast, wavenumber 6 for 3-4 day forecasts and at wavenumber 7 for 1-day and 5-day forecasts.</li>
						<li>In the error growth rate budget, flux of systematic error shows the net increase of error energy at wavenumber 1 through the triad interactions with the pairs of waves of other wavenumbers. Flux and pure generation of random error energy are found to be accumulated at wavenumber 4. Resolving the possible triads in wavenumber 4 associated with these terms, it is shown that the wave receives more energy from the pairs of waves of different wavenumbers than it loses, leading to the error energy peak at wavenumber 4. However, the significant triad interaction occurs among the wavenumber 2 and higher wavenumbers in systematic error energy flux.</li>

				<title>Numerical simulation of sea breeze characteristics observed at tropical coastal site, Kalpakkam</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0197-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sea breeze characteristics around Kalpakkam tropical coastal site are studied using an Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) mesoscale model, which is non-hydrostatic, compressible atmospheric prediction model following the terrain coordinate system. Various options such as surface physics, atmospheric radiation physics, Coriolis force, microphysics, cumulus parameterization and 1.5 level TKE closure scheme for diffusion are included in the model.</p>
					<p>A joint meteorological field experiment was carried out by IITM-Pune and IGCAR at Kalpakkam by deploying state-of-the-art sensors and tether balloon systems for observing the height profiles of meteorological parameters. The data obtained from the field experiment are used here to compare the results from numerical simulations. From the simulated results, it is seen that duration of the sea breeze is 6 hours which agrees well with the observations. The height of the Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL) is also simulated from the vertical profiles of potential temperature. Simulated wind speed and wind directions are compared with the 50m tower data and potential temperature profiles are compared with the kytoon data. Results are in good agreement with the observed values except during night time wherein a small difference is seen in the wind speed.</p>

				<title>Spatial variability and rainfall characteristics of Kerala</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0211-0221</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geographical regions of covariability in precipitation over the Kerala state are exposed using factor analysis. The results suggest that Kerala can be divided into three unique rainfall regions, each region having a similar covariance structure of annual rainfall. Stations north of 10&#176;N (north Kerala) fall into one group and they receive more rainfall than stations south of 10&#176;N (south Kerala). Group I stations receive more than 65% of the annual rainfall during the south-west monsoon period, whereas stations falling in Group II receive 25-30% of annual rainfall during the pre-monsoon and the north-east monsoon periods. The meteorology of Kerala is profoundly influenced by its orographical features, however it is difficult to make out a direct relationship between elevation and rainfall. Local features of the state as reflected in the rainfall distribution are also clearly brought out by the study.</p>

				<title>Proper depiction of monsoon depression through IRS-P4 MSMR</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0223-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, daily variations of satellite-derived geophysical parameters such as integrated water vapour (IWV), cloud liquid water content (CLW), sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface wind speed (SSW) have been studied for a case of monsoon depression that formed over the Bay of Bengal during 19th-24th August 2000. For this purpose, IRS P4 MSMR satellite data have been utilized over the domain equator- 25&#176;N and 40&#176;-100&#176;E. An integrated approach of satellite data obtained from IRS-P4, METEOSAT-5 and INSAT was made for getting a signal for the development of monsoon depression over the Indian region. Variations in deep convective activity obtained through visible, infrared and OLR data at 06UTC was thoroughly analyzed for the complete life cycle of monsoon depression. Geophysical parameters obtained through IRS-P4 satellite data were compared with vorticity, convergence and divergence at 850 and 200 hPa levels generated through cloud motion vectors (CMVs) and water vapour wind vectors (WVWVs) obtained from METEOSAT-5 satellite. This comparison was made for finding proper consistency of geophysical parameters with dynamical aspects of major convective activity of the depression.</p>
					<p>From the results of this study it is revealed that there was strengthening of sea surface winds to the south of low-pressure area prior to the formation of depression. This indicated the possibility of increase in cyclonic vorticity in the lower troposphere. Hence, wind field at 850 hPa with satellite input of CMVs in objective analysis of wind field using optimum interpolation (OI) scheme was computed. Maximum cyclonic vorticity field at 850 hPa was obtained in the region of depression just one day before its formation. Similarly, with the same procedure maximum anticyclonic vorticity was observed at 200 hPa with WVWVs input. Consistent convergence and divergence at 850 and 200 hPa was noticed with respect to these vorticities. In association with these developments, we could get lowest values of OLR (120W/m<sup>2</sup>) associated with major convective activity that was consistent with the maximum values of integrated water vapour (6-8 gm/cm<sup>2</sup>) and cloud liquid water content (50-60 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) persisting particularly in the southwest sector of the monsoon depression.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The problem of the coseismic deformation of an earth model consisting of an elastic layer of uniform thickness overlying an elastic half-space due to a very long tensile fault in the layer is solved analytically. Integral expressions for the surface displacements are obtained for a vertical tensile fault and a horizontal tensile fault. The integrals involved are evaluated approximately by using Sneddon's method of replacing the integrand by a finite sum of exponential terms. Detailed numerical results showing the variation of the displacements with epicentral distance for various source locations in the layer are presented graphically. The displacement field in the layered half-space is compared with the corresponding field in a uniform half-space to demonstrate the effect of the internal boundary. Relaxed rigidity method is used for computing the postseismic deformation of an earth model consisting of an elastic layer of uniform thickness overlying a viscoelastic half-space.</p>

				<title>Strains of scattering of near-field of a point source</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0247-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three dimensional scattering of near-field is studied for dilatation and rotation in the time domain. The perturbation method is applied to solve the equation of motion for the first order scattering from a weak inhomogeneity in an otherwise homogeneous medium. The inhomogeneity is assumed close enough to the point source so that the near-field intermediate wave is dominating over the far-field spherical 𝑃 and 𝑆 pulses. The integral expressions are derived to relate dilatation and rotation of scattering to the radial fluctuations of velocities and density in the inhomogeneity. These integrals are solved to calculate the strains of scattering from (a part of) an inhomogeneous spherical shell of arbitrary curvature. Variable curvature may allow the shape of inhomogeneity volume element to change uniformly from spherical to rectangular. Rotation of scattering from a spherical shell is independent of 𝑃 wave velocity inhomogeneity. Dilatation of scattering does  not involve 𝑆 wave velocity inhomogeneity but its gradient. The back scattering results are obtained as a special case. Strains are computed numerically, for hypothetical models to study the effects of various parameters viz., velocity inhomogeneity, distance of source from inhomogeneity and from receiver, and thickness of inhomogeneity. The curvature of the spherical shell is varied to study the effects of the shape of inhomogeneous volume element on scattering.</p>

					<p>The study delineates the vorticity and angular momentum balances of Asian summer monsoon during the evolution and established phases. It also elucidates the differences between these balances in the National Centre for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis and the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (NCM- RWF) analysis fields. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for a 40 year period (1958-97) and the NCM- RWF analysis for a three year (1994-96) period are made use of for the purpose. The time mean summer monsoon circulation is bifurcated into stable mean and transient eddy components and the mean component is elucidated.</p>
					<p>The generation of vorticity due to stretching of isobars balances most of the vorticity transported out of the monsoon domain during the evolution period. However, during the established period, the transportation by the relative and planetary vorticity components exceeds the generation due to stretching. The effective balancing mechanism is provided by vorticity generation due to sub-grid scale processes. The flux convergence of omega and relative momenta over the monsoon domain is effectively balanced by pressure torque during the evolution and established phases. Nevertheless, the balance is stronger during the established period due to the increase in the strength of circulation.</p>
					<p>Both the NCMRWF and NCEP fields indicate the mean features related to vorticity and angular momentum budgets realistically. Apart from the oceanic bias (strong circulation over oceans rather than continents), the summer monsoon circulation indicated by the NCEP is feeble compared to NCMRWF. The significant terms in the large-scale budgets of vorticity and angular momentum enunciate this aspect.</p>

The varying flattening is also revealed by the geometry of folds. The apparent buckle shortening of folds which ranges between 49 and 67 per cent with a majority of the folds having shortening values between 50% and 55% (exclusive of layer parallel strain) and inverse thickness method strain up to 50%. Besides flattening, the fold geometry was also modified by the pressure solution. This is borne by the presence of dark seams rich in phyllosilicates and disseminated carbonaceous material offsetting limbs of buckled quartz veins in slates.</p>

				<title>Influence of southern oscillation and SSTs over Nino-3.4 region on the winter monsoon rainfall over coastal Andhra Pradesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0313-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An analysis of the mean monthly data of 124 years reveals that the relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index in September and the winter monsoon rainfall (WMR) over Coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) is variable and non-stationary. In the recent four decades, however, SOI (Sept) is negatively and significantly correlated with CAP WMR. A similar analysis is performed using 50 years of mean monthly SSTs over Nino-3.4 region in August and September and CAP WMR to detect a possible relationship and there is a striking positive relation between them. In both of the above cases, the September signal is more significant in the recent four decades than for the other months and seasons for probable prediction of CAP WMR. Finally, to examine the influence of SO on the winter monsoon rainfall, a non-parametric test "Mann-Whitney Rank Statistics" test has been applied to the rainfall associated with extreme positive and negative SOI events.</p>

				<title>Enrichment characteristics of radioelements in various types of rock from Sambalpur district, Orissa, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0321-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Over the years a large number of rock samples were collected by the explorationists of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), Department of Atomic Energy from Sambalpur district, Orissa, India. The variation of uranium enrichment with various types of rock in these samples was studied with an aim to help quick reviewing of toposheets in case of newly taken up areas, for uranium exploration. The radioelements U, Th and K determined for these samples are plotted in ternary diagrams for classifying them as being uraniferous or thoriferous with respect to various type of rocks, keeping the total natural content of radioelements (expressed by $eU_{3}O_{8}$) as a parameter.</p>
					<p>In this study it is seen that samples of quartzofeldspathic breccia type are enriched in uranium irrespective of their further sub classiffication and $eU_{3}O_{8}$ content. Granites are enriched in thorium when $eU_{3}O_{8}$ &gt; 100 ppm and are enriched in uranium when $eU_{3}O_{8} &lt; 100 ppm$.</p>
					<p>A database prepared for this purpose may be useful for reviewing toposheets in future.</p>

				<title>Observations of the atmospheric surface layer parameters over a semi arid region during the solar eclipse of August 11th, 1999</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0353-0363</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses the observations of the Atmospheric Surface Layer (ASL) parameters during the solar eclipse of August 11th, 1999. Intensive surface layer experiments were conducted at Ahmedabad (23&#176; 21&#8242;N, 72&#176; 36&#8242;E), the western part of India, which was close to the totality path. This rare event provided by nature is utilised to document the surface layer effects during the eclipse period using measurements of high frequency fluctuations of temperature, tri-axial wind components as well as mean parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and subsoil temperature. Analysis showed that during the eclipse period, the turbulence parameters were affected leading to the suppression of the turbulence process, the main dynamic process in the atmospheric boundary layer, while the mean parameters showed variations within the natural variability of the observational period. The spectra of the wind components and temperature indicated decrease in  spectral power by one order in magnitude during the eclipse period. The rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy is found to decrease by more than one order during the eclipse period. The stability parameter showed a change from unstable to stable condition during the period of eclipse and back to unstable condition by the end of eclipse.</p>

				<title>The aeolian sedimentation record of the Thar desert</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0371-0401</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A review of the aeolian sedimentary record of the Thar desert is presented. This includes a regional survey of the major dune forms, their genesis and their relationship to climate and other regional landforms. A key aspect of this work is the chronometry of the dunes using luminescence methods. Luminescence dating of sand has enabled quantification of the duration of the phases of sand aggradation and quiescence, time scales of dune migration and the dating of pedogenic carbonates. We demonstrate that the conventional wisdom of synchronicity of dune aggradation with glacial epoch is not true in the context of Thar sands and here only a short duration <i>window of opportunity</i> existed for dune aggradation. Luminescence ages further suggest that this window occurred during a transitional climatic regime from glacial to interglacial about 4-10 ka after the glacial epoch. Other inferences included are that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the aeolian activity in the Thar began over &lt; 150 ka, resolving that Thar is not of anthropogenic origin as suggested previously;</li>
						<li>the present spatial extent of the aeolian activity in the Thar is in a contracted stage compared to that in the geological past, which refutes the arguments on its rapid north-eastward expansion;</li>
						<li>the current dune migration rates in areas of significant human-induced disturbances are much higher than during the geological past;</li>
						<li>the monsoon activity in the Thar varied significantly, from being minimal during the isotopic marine stages 4 and 2 to being close to the present during stage 3;</li>
						<li>on shorter time scales the dune activities correlated with the lacustrine records of the region with a phase difference of a few centuries and a periodicity of ∼1500 years;</li>
						<li>the sand aggradation climate in the southern margin in Gujarat gradually shrank northwards such that in general dunes older than 10 ka are seen in the extreme southern margin and dunes younger than 2 ka ages occur mostly in the western part of Rajasthan.</li>

				<title>Palaeoenvironmental history of Bap-Malar and Kanod playas of western Rajasthan, Thar desert</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0403-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two playas in the arid core of the western margin of the Thar desert viz., Bap-Malar and Kanod, have been investigated using palynology, geomorphology, archaeology, AMS-radiocarbon dating, stable isotopes, evaporite mineralogy and geoarchaeology. The principal objective was to obtain a reliable lithostratigraphy of the playa sediments. These are about 7m thick in the Bap-Malar and &lt; 2.5 to 3m thick in the Kanod. AMS <sup>14</sup>C dates of &lt; 15 ka BP on pollen from sediment layers indicates that the Bap-Malar playa possibly existed even during the LGM. These playas were full of water during the early Holocene (8 ka BP &#8212; 5.5 ka BP) and were ephemeral during the Pleistocene- Holocene transition and early to mid to late Holocene. The playas dried almost 1000 years earlier than those occurring on the eastern margin. Pollen of graminaceae, chenopodiaceae / amaranthaceae, cyperaceae etc. and evaporite minerals like gypsum, halite in the profiles indicate that the playas were surrounded by vegetation dominated by grass and that, they remained brackish to saline even during the mid Holocene, lake full stage. Stable dune surfaces, pediments with regoliths, and gravelly channels of ephemeral streams provided a favorable geomorphic niche for nomadic human activity since ∼7 ka BP. Though local ecological factors have played an important role in the evolution of the playas, the winter rains, connected with northwesterly depressions, most likely played a vital role in maintaining these playas.</p>

				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0427-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Luni river basin has been evolved as a result of typical hydrogeomorphic processes of arid zone, operating under the influence of active tectonic lineaments. A detailed analysis of stream morphology in relation to geology and lineaments carried out on selected windows indicated the morphological control of the streams while flowing over the lineaments from the eastern to the western part of the basin. Typical valley fills indicated by dark green tone on digitally processed images and the pediments showing greenish white tone appear in sharp contrast and indicate respectively the graben and horst structures. A detailed identification of lineaments for the georesources and geological evaluation has been carried out. Earlier analysis carried out on Bouguer anomalies correlate with graben and horst structures in the subsurface. Quaternary sequences have been dated from 80 ka to 3 ka indicating a range of fluvial to aeolian deposits reflecting prevailing climatic conditions. However, the changes in sediment type from coarse and mixed of all size grades to fine in a vertical litho-column warrant further studies on fine resolution stratigraphy and high resolution stratigraphy for understanding climatic variations in the region.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary stratigraphic development in the lower Luni, Mahi and Sabarmati river basins, western India</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0453-0471</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study reviews the Quaternary alluvial stratigraphy in three semi-arid river basins of western India i.e., lower Luni (Rajasthan), and Mahi and Sabarmati (Gujarat alluvial plains). On the basis of OSL chronologies, it is shown that the existing intra-valley lithostratigraphic correlations require a revision. The sand, gravel and mud facies are present during various times in the three basins, however, the fluvial response to climate change, and the resulting facies associations, was different in the Thar desert as compared to that at the desert margin; this makes purely lithostratigraphic correlations unviable. It is further shown that the rivers in the Thar desert were more sensitive to climate change and had small response times and geomorphic thresholds as compared to the desert-margin rivers. This is illustrated during the early OIS 1, when the Luni river in the Thar desert was dynamic and showed frequent variations in fluvial styles such as gravel bedload braided streams, sand-bed ephemeral streams and meandering streams, all followed by incision during the early Holocene. The coeval deposits in Sabarmati, however, only show a meandering, floodplain-dominated river.</p>
					<p>Late Quaternary alluvial deposits in these basins unconformably overlie some older deposits that lack any absolute chronology. Based on the facies types and their associations, and the composition and architecture of the multistoried gravel sheets in the studied sections, it is suggested that older deposits are of pre-Quaternary age. This hypothesis implies the presence of a large hiatus incorporating much of the Quaternary period in the exposed sections.</p>

				<title>Calcretes in the Thar desert: Genesis, chronology and palaeoenvironment</title>
				<feature>Special Section on: Quaternary History and Palaeoenvironmental Record of the Thar Desert in India</feature>
				<page>0473-0515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The calcretes in the Thar desert occur in a variety of settings, including the piedmonts, sheet-wash aggraded plains; and this study adds calcretes in regolith and colluvio-alluvial plains to the group of settings in which calcretes occur in the region. Field logs, morphological details and analytical data such as petrographic, cathodoluminescence and geochemical characteristics are described along with a discussion on their implications. Sand dunes and sandy plains dating to &gt; 20 ka have weakly developed calcretes. The better-developed calcrete horizons occur in pied- monts, interdunes or in areas that have sufficient groundwater. Deep sections in the region show phases of calcrete development in aeolian sand aggradation at ∼150, ∼100, ∼60 and 27-14 ka. The extensive sheetwash plains have mature calcretes and date to mid-Pleistocene. Our studies indicate that these calcretes represent a hybrid process, where carbonate enrichment of the originally calcareous host occurred due to periodically raised groundwaters, and its differentiation into nodules occurred under subaerial environment i.e., after recession of groundwater. Deep sections also show a stack of discrete calcretes that developed in individual aggradation episodes with hiatuses as indicated by ESR dating results. Nodules display a multiplicity of carbonate precipitation events and internal reorganization of calcitic groundmass. The process is accompanied by degradation and transformation of unstable minerals, particularly clays and with a neosynthesis of palygorskite.</p>
					<p>The ancient calcretes are dated from the beginning of the Quaternary to ∼600 ka and show more evolved morphologies marked by brecciation, dissolution, laminar growth on brecciated surfaces, pisolites and several generations of re-cementation. Mica/chlorite schists and such other rocks are particularly vulnerable to replacement by carbonate. In an extreme case, replacement of quart-zose sandstone was observed also. The presence of stretches of alluvio-colluvial plains in an area presently devoid of drainage bespeaks of occasional high-energy fluvial regime, under a semi-arid climate. The mid-Pleistocene period saw a shift towards more arid climate and this facilitated sheetwash aggradation. Finally, during the late Pleistocene, aggradation of aeolian sands indicated a progressively drier climate. However, this does not find its reflection in stable isotope data. The amount of carbonate in the form of calcretes is substantial. The present studies indicate that aeolian dust or rainwater are minor contributors to the carbonate budget. A more important source was provided by the pre-existing calcretes in the sheetwash aggraded plains and detrital carbonate in the aeolian sediments. The original source of carbonate in the region, however, remains unresolved and will need further investigations. Electron spin resonance protocols for the dating of calcretes were developed as a part of this study and the results accorded well with geological reasoning.</p>

				<title>Trace element geochemistry of Amba Dongar carbonatite complex, India: Evidence for fractional crystallization and silicate-carbonate melt immiscibility</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0519-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbonatites are believed to have crystallized either from mantle-derived primary carbonate magmas or from secondary melts derived from carbonated silicate magmas through liquid immiscibility or from residual melts of fractional crystallization of silicate magmas. Although the observed coexistence of carbonatites and alkaline silicate rocks in most complexes, their coeval emplacement in many, and overlapping initial <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd ratios are supportive of their cogenesis; there have been few efforts to devise a quantitative method to identify the magmatic processes. In the present study we have made an attempt to accomplish this by modeling the trace element contents of carbonatites and coeval alkaline silicate rocks of Amba Dongar complex, India. Trace element data suggest that the carbonatites and alkaline silicate rocks of this complex are products of fractional crystallization of two separate parental melts. Using the available silicate melt-carbonate melt partition coefficients for various trace elements, and the observed data from carbonatites, we have tried to simulate trace element distribution pattern for the parental silicate melt. The results of the modeling not only support the hypothesis of silicate-carbonate melt immiscibility for the evolution of Amba Dongar but also establish a procedure to test the above hypothesis in such complexes.</p>

				<title>A preliminary geochemical study of zircons and monazites from Deccan felsic dikes, Rajula, Gujarat, India: Implications for crustal melting</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0533-0542</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zircons of 10–100 𝜇 m size and monazites of up to 10 𝜇 m size are present in rhyolite and trachyte dikes associated with Deccan basalts around Rajula in the southern Saurashtra Peninsula of Gujarat. On the basis of structural conformity of the felsic and basaltic dikes, K-Ar ages and trace element considerations, a previous study concluded that the felsic rocks are coeval with the Deccan Volcanics and originated by crustal anatexis. The felsic rocks contain two populations of zircons and monazites, one that crystallized from the felsic melt and the other that contains inherited crustal material. Trace element variations in the rhyolites and trachytes indicate that zircons and monazites crystallized from the felsic melts, but compositional analysis of a zircon indicates the presence of a small core possibly inherited from the crust. Hf compositional zoning proﬁle of this zircon indicates that it grew from the host rhyolitic melt while the melt differentiated, and Y and LREE contents suggest that this zircon crystallized from the host melt. Pb contents of some monazites also suggest the presence of inherited crustal cores. Hence, any age determination by the U-Th-Pb isotopic method should be interpreted with due consideration to crustal inheritance. Temperatures estimated from zircon and monazite saturation thermometry indicate that the crust around Rajula may have been heated to a maximum of approximately 900&#176;C by the intruding Deccan magma. Crustal melting models of other workers indicate that a 1-2 million year emplacement time for the Deccan Traps may be appropriate for crustal melting characteristics observed in the Rajula area through the felsic dikes.</p>

				<title>Petrogenesis of granitoid rocks at the northern margin of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt and evidence of syn-collisional magmatism</title>

				<page>0543-0563</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The northern margin of the Eastern Ghats Mobile belt against the Singhbhum craton exposes granitic rocks with enclaves from both the high-grade and low-grade belts. A shear cleavage developed in the boundary region is also observed in these granitoids. Field features and petrography indicate syn-tectonic emplacement of these granitoids. Petrology-mineralogy and geochemistry indicate that some of the granitoids are derived from the high-grade protoliths by dehydration melting. Others could have been derived from low-grade protoliths. Moreover, microstructural signatures in these granitoids attest to their syn-collisional emplacement.</p>

				<title>Charnockitic magmatism in southern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0565-0585</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Large charnockite massifs cover a substantial portion of the southern Indian granulite terrain. The older (late Archaean to early Proterozoic) charnockites occur in the northern part and the younger (late Proterozoic) charnockites occur in the southern part of this high-grade terrain. Among these, the older Biligirirangan hill, Shevroy hill and Nilgiri hill massifs are intermediate charnockites, with Pallavaram massif consisting dominantly of felsic charnockites. The charnockite massifs from northern Kerala and Cardamom hill show spatial association of intermediate and felsic charnockites, with the youngest Nagercoil massif consisting of felsic charnockites. Their igneous parentage is evident from a combination of features including field relations, mineralogy, petrography, thermobarometry, as well as distinct chemical features. The southern Indian charnockite massifs show similarity with high-Ba–Sr granitoids, with the tonalitic intermediate charnockites showing similarity with high-Ba–Sr granitoids with low K<sub>2</sub>O/Na<sub>2</sub> ratios, and the felsic charnockites showing similarity with high-Ba–Sr granitoids with high K<sub>2</sub>O/Na<sub>2</sub>O ratios. A two-stage model is suggested for the formation of these charnockites. During the first stage there was a period of basalt underplating, with the ponding of alkaline mafic magmas. Partial melting of this mafic lower crust formed the charnockitic magmas. Here emplacement of basalt with low water content would lead to dehydration melting of the lower crust forming intermediate charnockites. Conversely, emplacement of hydrous basalt would result in melting at higher $f_{H}_{2}O$ favoring production of more siliceous felsic charnockites. This model is correlated with two crustal thickening phases in southern India, one related to the accretion of the older crustal blocks on to the Archaean craton to the north and the other probably related to the collision between crustal fragments of East and West Gondwana in a supercontinent framework.</p>

				<title>Chemical evolution, petrogenesis, and regional chemical correlations of the flood basalt sequence in the central Deccan Traps, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0587-0603</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The lava sequence of the central-western Deccan Traps (from Jalgaon towards Mumbai) is formed by basalts and basaltic andesites having a signiﬁcant variation in TiO<sub>2</sub> (from 1.2 to 3.3 wt%), Zr (from 84 to 253 ppm), Nb (from 5 to 16 ppm) and Ba (from 63 to 407 ppm), at MgO ranging from 10 to 4.2 wt%. Most of these basalts follow a liquid line of descent dominated by low pressure fractionation of clinopyroxene, plagioclase and olivine, starting from the most maﬁc compositions, in a temperature range from 1220&#176; to 1125&#176;C. These rocks resemble those belonging to the lowermost formations of the Deccan Traps in the Western Ghats (Jawhar, Igatpuri and Thakurvadi) as well as those of the Poladpur formation. Samples analyzed for <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr give a range of initial ratios from 0.70558 to 0.70621. A group of ﬂows of the Dhule area has low TiO<sub>2</sub> ($1.2–1.5$ wt%) and Zr ($84–105$ ppm) at moderate MgO ($5.2–6.2$ wt%), matching the composition of low-Ti basalts of Gujarat, low-Ti dykes of the Tapti swarm and Toranmal basalts, just north of the study area. This allows chemical correlations between the lavas of central Deccan, the Tapti dykes and the northwestern outcrops. The mildly enriched high ﬁeld strength element contents of the samples with TiO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 1.5 wt% make them products of mantle sources broadly similar to those which generated the Ambenali basalts, but their high La/Nb and Ba/Nb, negative Nb anomalies in the mantle normalized diagrams, and relatively high <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr, make evident a crustal input with crustally derived materials at less differentiated stages than those represented in this sample set, or even within the sub-Indian lithospheric mantle.</p>

				<title>High-Ti type N-MORB parentage of basalts from the south Andaman ophiolite suite, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0605-0618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A complete dismembered sequence of ophiolite is well exposed in the south Andaman region that mainly comprises ultramaﬁc cumulates, serpentinite maﬁc plutonic and dyke rocks, pillow lava, radiolarian chert, and plagiogranite. Pillow lavas of basaltic composition occupy a major part of the Andaman ophiolite suite (AOS). These basalts are well exposed all along the east coast of southern part of the south AOS. Although these basalts are altered due to low-grade metamorphism and late hydrothermal processes, their igneous textures are still preserved. These basalts are mostly either aphyric or phyric in nature. Aphyric type exhibits intersertal or variolitic textures, whereas phyric variety shows porphyritic or sub-ophitic textures. The content of alkalies and silica classify these basalts as sub-alkaline basalts and alkaline basalts. A few samples show basaltic andesite, trachybasalt, or basanitic chemical composition. High-ﬁeld strength element (HFSE) geochemistry suggests that studied basalt samples are probably derived from similar parental magmas. Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> and CaO/TiO<sub>2</sub> ratios classify these basalts as high-Ti type basalt. On the basis of these ratios and many discriminant functions and diagrams, it is suggested that the studied basalts, associated with Andaman ophiolite suite, were derived from magma similar to N-MORB and emplaced in the mid-oceanic ridge tectonic setting.</p>

				<title>Relative contributions of crust and mantle to the origin of the Bijli Rhyolite in a palaeoproterozoic bimodal volcanic sequence (Dongargarh Group), central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0619-0648</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New mineralogical, bulk chemical and oxygen isotope data on the Palaeoproterozoic Bijli Rhyolite, the basal unit of a bimodal volcanic sequence <i>(Dongargarh Group)</i> in central India, and one of the most voluminous silicic volcanic expressions in the Indian Shield, are presented. The Bijli Rhyolite can be recognized as a poorly sorted pyroclastic deposit, and comprises of phenocrystic K-feldspar + albite ± anorthoclase set in ﬁne-grained micro-fragmental matrix of quartz-feldsparsericite- chlorite-iron-oxide ± calcite. The rocks are largely metaluminous with high SiO<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>O+ K<sub></sub>O, Fe/Mg, Ga/Al, Zr, Ta, Sn, Y, REE and low CaO, Ba, Sr contents; the composition points to an ‘A-type granite’ melt. The rocks show negative Cs-, Sr-, Eu- and Ti- anomalies with incompatible element concentrations 2–3 times more than the upper continental crust (UCC). LREE is high (La/Yb ∼20) and HREE 20-30 times chondritic. 𝛿<sup>18</sup> O<sub>whole-rock</sub> varies between 4.4 and 7.8‰(mean 5.87 ± 1.26‰).</p>
					<p>The Bijli melt is neither formed by fractionation of a basaltic magma, nor does it represent a fractionated crustal melt. It is shown that the mantle-derived high temperature basaltic komatiitic melts/high Mg basalts triggered crustal melting, and interacted predominantly with deep crust compositionally similar to the Average Archaean Granulite (AAG), and a shallower crustal component with low CaO and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to give rise to the hybrid Bijli melts. Geochemical mass balance suggests that ∼30% partial melting of AAG under anhydrous condition, instead of the upper continental crust (UCC) including the Amgaon granitoid gneiss reported from the area, better matches the trace element concentrations in the rocks. The similar Ta/Th of the rhyolites (0.060) and average granulite (0.065) vs. UCC (0.13) also support a deep crustal protolith. Variable contributions of crust and mantle, and action of hydrothermal ﬂuid are attributed for the spread in 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O<sub>whole-rock</sub> values. The fast eruption of high temperature (∼900&#176;C) rhyolitic melts suggests a rapid drop in pressure of melting related to decompression in an extensional setting.</p>

				<title>Late Archaean mantle metasomatism below eastern Indian craton: Evidence from trace elements, REE geochemistry and Sr-Nd-O isotope systematics of ultramafic dykes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0649-0665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trace, rare earth elements (REE), Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and O isotope studies have been carried out on ultramafic (harzburgite and lherzolite) dykes belonging to the newer dolerite dyke swarms of eastern Indian craton. The dyke swarms were earlier considered to be the youngest mafic magmatic activity in this region having ages not older than middle to late Proterozoic. The study indicates that the ultramafic members of these swarms are in fact of late Archaean age (Rb-Sr isochron age 2613 ± 177 Ma, $Sr_{i}$ ∼0.702 ± 0.004) which attests that out of all the cratonic blocks of India, eastern Indian craton experienced earliest stabilization event. Primitive mantle normalized trace element plots of these dykes display enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE), pronounced Ba, Nb and Sr depletions but very high concentrations of Cr and Ni. Chondrite normalised REE plots exhibit light REE (LREE) enrichment with nearly flat heavy REE (HREE; (𝛴 HREE)<sub>N</sub> ∼ 2-3 times chondrite, $(Gd/Yb)_{N}$∼1). The 𝜀<sub>Nd</sub>(t) values vary from +1.23 to −3.27 whereas 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O values vary from +3.16‰ to +5.29‰ (average +3.97‰ ± 0.75‰) which is lighter than the average mantle value. Isotopic, trace and REE data together indicate that during 2.6 Ga the nearly primitive mantle below the eastern Indian Craton was metasomatised by the fluid (±silicate melt) coming out from the subducting early crust resulting in LILE and LREE enriched, Nb depleted, variable 𝜀<sub>Nd</sub>, low Sr_{i}(0.702)$ and low 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O bearing EMI type mantle. Magmatic blobs of this metasomatised mantle were subsequently emplaced in deeper levels of the granitic crust which possibly originated due to the same thermal pulse.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry and petrogenesis of anorogenic basic volcanic-plutonic rocks of the Kundal area, Malani Igneous Suite, western Rajasthan, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0667-0681</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kundal area of Malani Igneous Suite consists of volcano-plutonic rocks. Basalt flows and gabbro intrusives are associated with rhyolite. Both the basic rocks consist of similar mineralogy of plagioclase, clinopyroxene as essential and Fe-Ti oxides as accessories. Basalt displays sub-ophitic and glomeroporphyritic textures whereas gabbro exhibits sub-ophitic, porphyritic and intergrannu- lar textures. They show comparable chemistry and are enriched in Fe, Ti and incompatible ele- ments as compared to MORB/CFB. Samples are enriched in LREE and slightly depleted HREE patterns with least significant positive Eu anomalies. Petrographical study and petrogenetic mod- eling of [Mg]-[Fe], trace and REE suggest cogenetic origin of these basic rocks and they probably derived from Fe-enriched source with higher Fe/Mg ratio than primitive mantle source. Thus, it is concluded that the basic volcano-plutonic rocks of Kundal area are the result of a low to moderate degree (&gt; 30%) partial melting of source similar to picrite/komatiitic composition. Within plate, anorogenic setting for the basic rocks of Kundal area is suggested, which is in conformity with the similar setting for Malani Igneous Suite.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry and petrogenesis of early Cretaceous sub-alkaline mafic dykes from Swangkre-Rongmil, East Garo Hills, Shillong plateau, northeast India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0683-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Numerous early Cretaceous maﬁc and alkaline dykes, mostly trending in N-S direction, are emplaced in the Archaean gneissic complex of the Shillong plateau, northeastern India. These dykes are spatially associated with the N-S trending deep-seated Nongchram fault and well exposed around the Swangkre-Rongmil region. The petrological and geochemical characteristics of maﬁc dykes from this area are presented. These maﬁc dykes show very sharp contact with the host rocks and do not show any signature of assimilation with them. Petrographically these maﬁc dykes vary from ﬁne-grained basalt (samples from the dyke margin) to medium-grained dolerite (samples from the middle of the dyke) having very similar chemical compositions, which may be classiﬁed as basaltic-andesite/andesite. The geochemical characteristics of these maﬁc dykes suggest that these are genetically related to each other and probably derived from the same parental magma. Although, the high-ﬁeld strength element (+rare-earth elements) compositions disallow the possibility of any crustal involvement in the genesis of these rocks, but Nb/La, La/Ta, and Ba/Ta ratios, and similarities of geochemical characteristics of present samples with the Elan Bank basalts and Rajmahal (Group II) maﬁc dyke samples, suggest minor contamination by assimilation with a small amount of upper crustal material. Chemistry, particularly REE, hints at an alkaline basaltic nature of melt. Trace element modelling suggests that the melt responsible for these maﬁc dykes had undergone extreme differentiation (∼50%) before its emplacement. The basaltic-andesite nature of these rocks may be attributed to this differentiation. Chemistry of these rocks also indicates ∼10–15% melting of the mantle source. The maﬁc dyke samples of the present investigation show very close geochemical similarities with the maﬁc rocks derived from the Kerguelen mantle plume. Perhaps the Swangkre-Rongmil maﬁc dykes are also derived from the Kerguelen mantle plume.</p>

				<title>Geodynamic evolution and crustal growth of the central Indian Shield: Evidence from geochemistry of gneisses and granitoids</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0699-0714</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rare earth element patterns of the gneisses of Bastar and Bundelkhand are marked by LREE enrichment and HREE depletion with or without Eu anomaly. The spidergram patterns for the gneisses are characterized by marked enrichment in LILE with negative anomalies for Ba, P and Ti. The geochemical characteristics exhibited by the gneisses are generally interpreted as melts generated by partial melting of a subducting slab. The style of subduction was ﬂat subduction, which was most common in the Archean. The rare earth patterns and the multi-element diagrams with marked enrichment in LILE and negative anomalies for Ba, P and Ti of the granitoids of both the cratons indicate interaction between slab derived melts and the mantle wedge. The subduction angle was high in the Proterozoic. Considering the age of emplacement of the gneisses and granitoids that differs by ∼ 1 Ga, it can be assumed that these are linked to two independent subduction events: one during Archaean (ﬂat subduction) that generated the precursor melts for the gneisses and the other during the Proterozoic (high angle subduction) that produced the melts for the granitoids. The high values of Mg&#35;, Ni, Cr, Sr and low values of SiO2 in the granitoids of Bastar and Bundelkhand cratons compared to the gneisses of both the cratons indicate melt-mantle interaction in the generation of the granitoids. The low values of Mg#, Ni, Cr, Sr and high values of SiO<sub>2</sub> in the gneisses in turn overrules such melt-mantle interaction.</p>

				<title>Petrology of the prehistoric lavas and dyke of the Barren Island, Andaman Sea, Indian Ocean</title>

				<page>0715-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although Barren Island (Andaman Sea, Indian Ocean) witnessed several volcanic eruptions during historic times, the eruptions that led to the formation of this volcanic island occurred mainly during prehistoric times. It is still active and currently in the fumarolic stage. Its volcanic evolution appears to be characterized by a constructive phase with the piling up of lava ﬂows and scoria deposits and Strombolian activities, followed by a sudden collapse of the main cone. Deposits of a possible caldera-forming eruption were not recognized earlier. After a period of peri-calderic hydromagmatic activity, whose deposits presently mantle inner and outer caldera walls, a new phase of intracalderic Vulcanian activities took place. A prominent dyke in the SE inner side of the caldera wall was recognized. Petrographically the lava ﬂows and dyke are similar but they differ in their chemical composition (viz., SiO<sub>2</sub>, MgO, Ni, Cr) signiﬁcantly. Similarity in major, minor and trace element composition (viz., K/La, K/Nb, K/Rb, K/Ti ratios) of these rocks together with Chondrite normalized trace element (Rb, Ba, Sr, P, Zr, Ti and Nb) and REE (La, Ce, Nd and Y) patterns of the Barren Island prehistoric lava ﬂows and dyke and low-K lavas of Sunda Arc indicates that Barren Island must have evolved from a source similar to that of Sunda Arc lavas during the Quaternary Period.</p>

				<title>Silica-poor, mafic alkaline lavas from ocean islands and continents: Petrogenetic constraints from major elements</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0723-0736</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Strongly silica-poor (<i>ne</i>-normative), maﬁc alkaline lavas generally represented by olivine nephelinites, nephelinites, melilitites, and olivine melilitites have erupted at various locations during Earth’s history. On the basis of bulk-rock Mg#, high concentrations of Na<sub>2</sub>O, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and K<sub>2</sub>O, and trace element geochemistry, it has been suggested that these lavas represent low-degree melts that have undergone little crystal fractionation <i>en route</i> to the surface. Many of these lavas also carry highpressure mantle material in the form of harzburgite, spinel lherzolite, and variants of websterite xenoliths, and rare garnet-bearing xenoliths. However, phenocryst phases instead indicate that these magmas cooled to variable extents during their passage. We note subtle, yet important, differences in terms of CaO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and CaO/MgO. High-pressure experimental melting studies in CMAS-CO<sub>3</sub> (3–8GPa) and natural lherzolitic systems (3GPa) demonstrate that at an isobar increasing 𝐹 leads to a moderate decrease in CaO + MgO, whereas CaO/MgO and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sharply decrease. Relatively high CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> indicates melting in the presence of garnet (&#8805; 85km). Studies also demonstrate that CO<sub>2</sub>-bearing lherzolitic systems, when compared with anhydrous ones, also have higher CaO content in the coexisting melt at a given 𝑃 and 𝑇. Comparison of the bulk-rock major-element chemistry of silica-poor, maﬁc alkaline lavas with experimentally determined high-pressure melts indicates that melting of anhydrous mantle lherzolite or garnet pyroxenite is not able to explain many of the major element systematics of the lavas. However, high-pressure partial melts of carbonated lherzolite have the right major element trends. Among ocean islands, lavas from Samoa and Hawaii are perhaps the products of very low degree of partial melting. Lavas from Gran Canaria and Polynesia represent products of more advanced partial melting. On continents, lavas from South Africa and certain localities in Germany are the products of a very low degree of partial melting, and those from Texas and certain other localities in Germany are products of a slightly more advanced degree of partial melting of a carbonated lherzolite. Lavas from Deccan, Czech Republic, and Freemans Cove are the products of even more advanced degree of partial melting. The mere presence of mantle xenoliths in some of these lavas does not necessarily mean that the erupted lavas represent direct mantle melts.</p>

				<page>0737-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New <sup>40</sup>Ar-<sup>39</sup>Ar thermochronological results from the Ladakh region in the India-Asia collision zone provide a tectono-thermal evolutionary scenario. The characteristic granodiorite of the Ladakh batholith near Leh yielded a plateau age of 46.3 ± 0.6Ma (2𝜎 ). Biotite from the same rock yielded a plateau age of 44.6 ± 0.3Ma (2𝜎 ). The youngest phase of the Ladakh batholith, the leucogranite near Himya, yielded a cooling pattern with a plateau-like age of ∼36 Ma. The plateau age of muscovite from the same rock is 29.8 ± 0.2Ma (2𝜎 ). These ages indicate post-collision tectonothermal activity, which may have been responsible for partial melting within the Ladakh batholith. Two basalt samples from Sumdo Nala have also recorded the post-collision tectono-thermal event, which lasted at least for 8MY in the suture zone since the collision, whereas in the western part of the Indus Suture, pillow lava of Chiktan showed no effect of this event and yielded an age of emplacement of 128.2 ± 2.6Ma (2𝜎 ). The available data indicate that post-collision deformation led to the crustal thickening causing an increase in temperature, which may have caused partial melting at the base of the thickened crust. The high thermal regime propagated away from the suture with time.</p>

				<title>Magmatic underplating beneath the Rajmahal Traps: Gravity signature and derived 3-D configuration</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0759-0769</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The early Cretaceous thermal perturbation beneath the eastern continental margin of the Indian shield resulted in the eruption of the Rajmahal Traps. To understand the impact of the magmatic process that originated in the deep mantle on the lower crustal level of the eastern Indian shield and adjoining Bengal basin the conspicuous gravity anomalies observed over the region have been modelled integrating with available geophysical information. The 3-D gravity modelling has delineated 10–15km thick high-density (𝜌 = 3.02 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) accreted igneous layer at the base of the crust beneath the Rajmahal Traps. Thickness of this layer varies from 16km to the west of the Rajmahal towards north to about 12km near Kharagpur towards south and about 18km to the east of the Raniganj in the central part of the region. The greater thickness of the magmatic body beneath the central part of the region presents itself as the locus of the potential feeder channel for the Rajmahal Traps. It is suggested that the crustal accretion is the imprint of the mantle thermal perturbation, over which the eastern margin of the eastern Indian shield opened around 117Ma ago. The nosing of the crustal accretion in the down south suggests the possible imprint of the subsequent magmatic intrusion along the plume path.</p>

				<title>Two- and three-dimensional gravity modeling along western continental margin and intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts: Its relevance to Deccan flood basalt volcanism</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0771-0784</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The western continental margin and the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts are primarily covered by Deccan ﬂood basalts. Three-dimensional gravity modeling of +70 mgal Bouguer gravity highs extending in the north-south direction along the western continental margin rift indicates the presence of a subsurface high density, maﬁc-ultramaﬁc type, elongated, roughly ellipsoidal body. It is approximately 12.0 ± 1.2 km thick with its upper surface at an approximate depth of 6.0 ± 0.6km, and its average density is 2935 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Calculated dimension of the high density body in the upper crust is 300 ± 30km in length and 25 ± 2.5 to 40 ± 4 km in width. Three-dimensional gravity modeling of +10 mgal to −30 mgal Bouguer gravity highs along the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rift indicates the presence of eight small isolated high density maﬁc bodies with an average density of 2961 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. These maﬁc bodies are convex upward and their top surface is estimated at an average depth of 6.5 ± 0.6 (between 6 and 8 km). These isolated maﬁc bodies have an average length of 23.8 ± 2.4 km and width of 15.9 ± 1.5 km. Estimated average thickness of these maﬁc bodies is 12.4 ± 1.2 km. The difference in shape, length and width of these high density maﬁc bodies along the western continental margin and the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts suggests that the migration and concentration of high density magma in the upper lithosphere was much more dominant along the western continental margin rift. Based on the three-dimensional gravity modeling, it is conjectured that the emplacement of large, ellipsoidal high density maﬁc bodies along the western continental margin and small, isolated maﬁc bodies along the Narmada-Tapti rift are related to lineamentreactivation and subsequent rifting due to interaction of hot mantle plume with the lithospheric weaknesses (lineaments) along the path of Indian plate motion over the R´eunion hotspot. Maﬁc bodies formed in the upper lithosphere as magma chambers along the western continental margin and the intraplate Narmada-Tapti rifts at estimated depths between 6 and 8 km from the surface (consistent with geological, petrological and geochemical models) appear to be the major reservoirs for Deccan ﬂood basalt volcanism at approximately 65 Ma.</p>

				<title>Emplacement kinematics of nepheline syenites from the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt, west of Khariar, NW Orissa: Evidence from meso- and microstructures</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0785-0793</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nepheline syenite plutons emplaced within the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt west of Khariar in northwestern Orissa are marked by a well-developed magmatic fabric including magmatic foliation, mineral lineations, folds and S-C fabrics. The minerals in the plutons, namely microcline, orthoclase, albite, nepheline, hornblende, biotite and aegirine show, by and large, well-developed crystal faces and lack undulose extinction and dynamic recrystallization, suggesting a magmatic origin. The magmatic fabric of the plutons is concordant with a solid-state strain fabric of the surrounding mylonites that developed due to noncoaxial strain along the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone during thrusting of the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt over the Bastar Craton. However, a small fraction of the minerals, more commonly from the periphery of the plutons, is overprinted by a solid state strain fabric similar to that of the host rock. This fabric is manifested by discrete shear fractures, along which the feldspars are deformed into ribbons, have undergone dynamic recrystallization and show undulose extinction and myrmekitic growth. The shear fractures and the magmatic foliations are mutually parallel to the C-fabric of the host mylonites. Coexistence of concordant solid state strain fabric and magmatic fabric has been interpreted as a transitional feature from magmatic state to subsolidus deformation of the plutons, while the nepheline syenite magma was solidifying from a crystal-melt mush state under a noncoaxial strain. This suggests the emplacement of the plutons synkinematic to thrusting along the Terrane Boundary Shear Zone. The isotopic data by earlier workers suggest emplacement of nepheline syenite at 1500 + 3/− 4Ma, lending support for thrusting of the mobile belt over the craton around that time.</p>

				<title>The Neoproterozoic Malani magmatism of the northwestern Indian shield: Implications for crust-building processes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0795-0807</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Malani is the largest event of anorogenic felsic magmatism (covering ∼50,000km<sup>2</sup>) in India. This magmatic activity took place at ∼750Ma post-dating the Erinpura granite (850 Ma) and ended prior to Marwar Supergroup (680 Ma) sedimentation. Malani eruptions occurred mostly on land, but locally sub-aqueous conditions are shown by the presence of conglomerate, grits and pillow lava. The Malani rocks do not show any type of regional deformation effects. The Malanis are characterised by bimodal volcanism with a dominant felsic component, followed by granitic plutonism and a terminal dyke phase. An angular unconformity between Malani lavas and basement is observed, with the presence of conglomerate at Sindreth, Diri, and Kankani. This indicates that the crust was quite stable and peneplained prior to the Malani activity. Similarly, the absence of any thrust zone, tectonic m´elange and tectonised contact of the Malanis with the basement goes against a plate subduction setting for their genesis. After the closure of orogenic cycles in the Aravalli craton of the northwestern shield, this anorogenic intraplate magmatic activity took place in a cratonic rift setting under an extensional tectonic regime.</p>

				<title>A brief comparison of lava flows from the Deccan Volcanic Province and the Columbia-Oregon Plateau Flood Basalts: Implications for models of flood basalt emplacement</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0809-0817</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The nature and style of emplacement of Continental Flood Basalt (CFB) lava ﬂows has been a atter of great interest as well as considerable controversy in the recent past. However, even a cursory review of published literature reveals that the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) and Hawaiian volcanoes provide most of the data relevant to this topic. It is interesting to note, however, that the CRBG lava ﬂows and their palaeotopographic control is atypical of other CFB provinces in the world. In this paper, we ﬁrst present a short overview of important studies pertaining to the emplacement of ﬂood basalt ﬂows. We then brieﬂy review the morphology of lava ﬂows from the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) and the Columbia-Oregon Plateau ﬂood basalts. The review underscores the existence of signiﬁcant variations in lava ﬂow morphology between different provinces, and even within the same province. It is quite likely that there were more than one way of emplacing the voluminous and extensive CFB lava ﬂows. We argue that the establishment of general models of emplacement must be based on a comprehensive documentation of lava ﬂow morphology from all CFB provinces.</p>

				<page>0819-0829</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A hummocky ﬂow characterised by the presence of toes, lobes, tumuli and possible lava tube system is exposed near Daund, western Deccan Volcanic Province, India. The lava tube system is exposed as several exhumed outcrops and is composed of complex branching and discontinuous segments. The roof of the lava tube has collapsed but original lava tube walls and fragments of the tube roof are seen at numerous places along the tube. At some places the tube walls exhibit a single layer of lava lining, whereas, at other places it shows an additional layer characterised by smooth surface and polygonal cracks. The presence of a branching and meandering lava tube system in the Daund ﬂow, which represents the terminal parts of Thakurwadi Formation, shows that the hummocky ﬂow developed at a low local volumetric ﬂow rate. This tube system developed in the thinner parts of the ﬂow sequence; and tumuli developed in areas where the tube clogged temporarily in the sluggish ﬂow.</p>

				<title>Cones and craters on Mount Pavagadh, Deccan Traps: Rootless cones?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0831-0838</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rootless cones, also (erroneously) called pseudocraters, form due to explosions that ensue when a lava ﬂow enters a surface water body, ice, or wet ground. They do not represent primary vents connected by vertical conduits to a subsurface magma source. Rootless cones in Iceland are well studied. Cones on Mars, morphologically very similar to Icelandic rootless cones, have also been suggested to be rootless cones formed by explosive interaction between surface lava ﬂows and ground ice. We report here a group of gentle cones containing nearly circular craters from Mount Pavagadh, Deccan volcanic province, and suggest that they are rootless cones. They are very similar morphologically to the rootless cones of the type locality of Mý vatn in northeastern Iceland. A group of three phreatomagmatic craters was reported in 1998 from near Jabalpur in the northeastern Deccan, and these were suggested to be eroded cinder cones. A recent geophysical study of the Jabalpur craters does not support the possibility that they are located over volcanic vents. They could also be rootless cones. Many more probably exist in the Deccan, and volcanological studies of the Deccan are clearly of value in understanding planetary basaltic volcanism.</p>

				<title>Development and propagation of a pollution gradient in the marine boundary layer during INDOEX (1999)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0003-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development and propagation of a pollution gradient in the marine boundary layer over the Arabian Sea during the Intensive Field Phase of the Indian Ocean Experiment (1999) is investigated. A hypothesis for the generation of the pollution gradient is presented. Infrared satellite images show the formation of the pollution gradient as the leading edge of a polluted air mass in the marine boundary layer and also its propagation over the Arabian Sea and the northern Indian Ocean. Aerosol data measured from two research vessels over the Arabian Sea show a variation in the concentrations caused by the passage of this pollution gradient. Depth of the pollution gradient was found to be about 800 m. A numerical model was used to simulate the development of this gradient and its propagation over the ocean. Results show that its formation and structure are significantly influenced by the diurnal cycle of coastal sea-land breeze circulations along India's west coast. Transport of aerosols and gases over the Arabian Sea in the lower troposphere from land sources appears to be through this mechanism with the other being the elevated land plume.</p>

				<title>Some characteristics of very heavy rainfall over Orissa during summer monsoon season</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0017-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Orissa is one of the most flood prone states of India. The floods in Orissa mostly occur during monsoon season due to very heavy rainfall caused by synoptic scale monsoon disturbances. Hence a study is undertaken to find out the characteristic features of very heavy rainfall (24 hours rainfall &#8805; 125mm) over Orissa during summer monsoon season (June-September) by analysing 20 years (1980-1999) daily rainfall data of different stations in Orissa. The principal objective of this study is to find out the role of synoptic scale monsoon disturbances in spatial and temporal variability of very heavy rainfall over Orissa.</p>
					<p>Most of the very heavy rainfall events occur in July and August. The region, extending from central part of coastal Orissa in the southeast towards Sambalpur district in the northwest, experiences higher frequency and higher intensity of very heavy rainfall with less interannual variability. It is due to the fact that most of the causative synoptic disturbances like low pressure systems (LPS) develop over northwest (NW) Bay of Bengal with minimum interannual variation and the monsoon trough extends in west-northwesterly direction from the centre of the system. The very heavy rainfall occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the western side of Eastern Ghat during all the months and the season except September. It occurs more frequently with less interannual variability on the eastern side of Eastern Ghat during September. The NW Bay followed by Gangetic West Bengal/Orissa is the most favourable region of LPS to cause very heavy rainfall over different parts of Orissa except eastern side of Eastern Ghat. The NW Bay and west central (WC) Bay are equally favourable regions of LPS to cause very heavy rainfall over eastern side of Eastern Ghat. The frequency of very heavy rain-fall does not show any significant trend in recent years over Orissa except some places in north-east Orissa which exhibit significant rising trend in all the monsoon months and the season as a whole.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variability of physico-chemical characteristics of the Haldia channel of Hooghly estuary, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0037-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Physical and chemical characteristics of the Hooghly estuary during winter (December 1997-January 1998), summer (May 1998) and post-monsoon (November 1998) seasons have been stud-ied. Salinity varied spatially and temporally and seasonally during ebb and flood tide conditions. Water temperature showed a difference of 10&#176;C in winter to summer. Temperature did not vary much vertically as it is a well-mixed estuary. Strong currents exceeding $100 cm s^{-1}$ were observed during peak ebb and flood tide conditions irrespective of the season. Longitudinal eddy diffusion coe±cient $(K_x)$ was estimated as 757m s<sup>-1</sup> and 811m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> during summer and post-monsoon sea-sons, respectively. The vertical eddy diffusion coefficient (𝜀<sub>v</sub>) was estimated as 0.0337m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> during post-monsoon season. The salinity and current observations are compared with those obtained from models reported earlier. Values of pH, Dissolved Oxygen and Biological Oxygen Demand are within the threshold limits of the estuarine environment. Nutrients show seasonal variation in the estuarine environment. High values (160-2686 mg l<sup>-1</sup>) of total suspended matter were noticed both at surface and bottom in the study region showing the impact of fresh water and sediment transportation.</p>

				<title>Compositional variation and genesis of ferromanganese crusts of the Afanasiy-Nikitin Seamount, Equatorial Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0051-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eight ferromanganese crusts (Fe-Mn crusts) with igneous and sedimentary substrates collected at different water depths from the Afanasiy-Nikitin Seamount are studied for their bulk major, minor and rare earth element composition. The Mn/Fe ratios &gt; 1.5 indicate the hydrogenetic accretion of the Fe-Mn hydroxides. These Fe-Mn crusts are enriched in Co (up to 0.9%, average ∼0.5%) and Ce. The Ce-content is the highest reported so far (up to 3763 ppm, average ∼2250 ppm) for global ocean seamount Fe-Mn crusts. In spite of general similarity in the range of major, minor, and strictly trivalent rare earth element composition, the dissimilarity between the present Fe-Mn crusts and the Pacific seamount Fe-Mn crusts in Co and Ce associations with major mineral phases indicates inter-oceanic heterogeneity and region-specific conditions responsible for their enrichment.  The decrease in Ce-anomaly (from ∼8 to ∼1.5) with increasing water depth (from ∼1.7km to ∼3.2 km) might suggest that the modern intermediate depth low oxygen layer was shifted and sustained at a deeper depth for a long period in the past.</p>

				<title>Biological productivity, terrigenous influence and noncrustal elements supply to the Central Indian Ocean Basin: Paleoceanography during the past ∼1Ma</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 2 m-long sediment core from the siliceous ooze domain in the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB; 13&#176; 03&#8242;S: 74&#176; 44&#8242;E; water depth 5099 m) is studied for calcium carbonate, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, biogenic opal, major and few trace elements (Al, Ti, Fe, K, Mg, Zr, Sc,V, Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn, Co, and Ba) to understand the productivity and intensity of terrigenous supply. The age model of the sediment core is based on U-Th dating, occurrence of Youngest Toba Tuff of ∼74 ka and Australasian microtektites of ∼770ka.</p>
					<p>Low carbonate content (&gt; 1%) of sediment core indicates deposition below the carbonate compensation depth. Organic carbon content is also very low, almost uniform (mean 0.2 wt%) and is of marine origin. This suggests a well-oxygenated bottom water environment during the past ∼1100 ka. Our data suggest that during ∼1100 ka and ∼400 ka siliceous productivity was lower, complimented by higher supply of terrigenous material mostly derived from the metasedimentary rocks of High Himalayan crystalline. However, during the last ∼400ka, siliceous productivity increased with substantial reduction in the terrigenous sediment supply. The results suggest that intensity of Himalayan weathering, erosion associated with monsoons was comparatively higher prior to 400 ka. Manganese, Ba, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Co have around 90% of their supply from noncrustal (excess) source and their burial to seafloor remained unaffected throughout the past ∼1100ka.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Physico-mechanical properties of rocks have great significance in all operational parts in mining activities, from exploration to final dispatch of material. Compressional wave velocity (𝑝-wave velocity) and anisotropic behaviour of rocks are two such properties which help to understand the rock response under varying stress conditions. They also influence the breakage mechanism of rock. There are different methods to determine the 𝑝-wave velocity and anisotropy <i>in situ</i> and in the laboratory. These methods are cumbersome and time consuming. Fuzzy set theory, Fuzzy logic and Neural Networks techniques seem very well suited for typical geotechnical problems. In conjunction with statistics and conventional mathematical methods, hybrid methods can be developed that may prove to be a step forward in modeling geotechnical problems. Here, we have developed and compared two di®erent models, Neuro-fuzzy systems (combination of fuzzy and artificial neural network systems) and Artificial neural network systems, for the prediction of compressional wave velocity.</p>

				<title>Facies, dissolution seams and stable isotope compositions of the Rohtas Limestone (Vindhyan Supergroup) in the Son valley area, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0087-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The early Mesoproterozoic Rohtas Limestone in the Son valley area of central India represents an overall shallowing-upward carbonate succession. Detailed facies analysis of the limestone reveals outer- to inner-shelf deposition in an open marine setting. Wave-ripples, hummocky cross strat- ifications and edgewise conglomerates argue against a deep marine depositional model for the Rohtas Limestone proposed earlier. Stable isotope analysis of the limestone shows that 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O values are compatible with the early Mesoproterozoic open seawater composition. The ribbon limestone facies in the Rohtas Limestone is characterized by micritic beds, each decoupled in a lower band enriched and an upper band depleted in dissolution seams. Band-wise isotopic analysis reveals systematic short-term variations. Comparative enrichment of the heavier isotopes in the upper bands is attributed to early cementation from sea water and water derived from the lower band undergoing dissolution because of lowering of pH at depth. The short-term positive shifts in isotopic compositions in almost every upward gradational transition from a seamed band to a non-seamed band support the contention that dissolution seams here are of early diagenetic origin, although their formation was accentuated under overburden pressure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The calculation of the deformation caused by shear and tensile faults is necessary for the investigation of seismic and volcanic sources. The solution of the two-dimensional problem of a long inclined shear fault in two welded half-spaces is well known. The purpose of this note is to present the corresponding solution for a tensile fault. Closed-form analytical expressions for the Airy stress function for a tensile line source in two welded half-spaces are first obtained. These expressions are then integrated analytically to derive the Airy stress function for a long tensile fault of arbitrary dip and finite width. Closed-form analytical expressions for the displacements and stresses follow immediately from the Airy stress function. These expressions are suitable for computing the displacement and stress fields around a long inclined tensile fault near an internal boundary.</p>

				<title>Mineralogy and trace element chemistry of the Siliceous Earth of Barmer basin, Rajasthan: Evidence for a volcanic origin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0111-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the presence of a 3-5 cm thick loose fragmental layer in the Siliceous Earth at Matti ka Gol in the Barmer basin of Rajasthan. Petrographic, chemical and mineralogical study reveals the presence of abundant volcanic debris such as glass shards, agglutinates, hollow spheroids, kinked biotites, feldspars showing oscillatory zoning, olivines, ilmenite and native iron. The presence of similar particles in the whole section suggests that the Siliceous Earth is a volcanic ash. Stratigraphic correlation, palynological and microvertebrate data suggest that the Siliceous Earth may have deposited over a short span of time during the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Palaeocene. In view of the possibility that this section may contain K/T impact debris, we looked for grains having impact signatures. Some patches of the Siliceous Earth of Bariyara show the presence of Ni-rich (&lt; 0.5%) vesicular glasses, sanidine spherules, magnesioferrite crystals, soot, etc., but because of their low abundance, it is not possible to establish if they are volcanic, micrometeorite ablation products or a part of the K/T impact ejecta.</p>

				<title>Kinematics of large scale asymmetric folds and associated smaller scale brittle-ductile structures in the Proterozoic Somnur Formation, Pranhita - Godavari valley, south India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0125-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development of structural elements and finite strain data are analysed to constrain kinematics of folds and faults at various scales within a Proterozoic fold-and-thrust belt in Pranhita-Godavari basin, south India. The first order structures in this belt are interpreted as large scale buckle folds above a subsurface decollement emphasizing the importance of detachment folding in thin skinned deformation of a sedimentary prism lying above a gneissic basement. That the folds have developed through fixed-hinge buckling is constrained by the nature of variation of mesoscopic fabric over large folds and finite strain data. Relatively low, irrotational °attening strain (X:Z - 3.1-4.8, k &gt; 1) are associated with zones of near upright early mesoscopic folds and cleavage, whereas large flattening strain (X:Z - 3.9-7.3, k &gt; 1) involving noncoaxiality are linked to domains of asymmetric, later inclined folds, faults and intense cleavage on the hanging wall of thrusts on the flanks of large folds. In the latter case, the bulk strain can be factorized to components of pure shear and simple shear with a maximum shearing strain of 3. The present work reiterates the importance of analysis of minor structures in conjunction with strain data to unravel the kinematic history of fold-and-thrust belts developed at shallow crustal level.</p>

				<title>Contrasting metamorphism across Cauvery Shear Zone, south India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0143-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Palghat Cauvery Shear Zone (CSZ) is a major shear zone that possibly extends into different fragments of Gondwanaland. In the present study maﬁc granulites occurring on either side of the CSZ in Namakkal area, southern India are examined. Textural features recorded in the maﬁc granulites are crucial in elucidating the metamorphic history of the southern granulite terrane (SGT).</p>
					<p>In the maﬁc granulites occurring to the south of CSZ, evidence of garnet breaking down during near isothermal decompression (ITD) is indicated by the development of orthopyroxene + plagioclase moats in between quartz and garnet. The presence of comparatively small elongated second generation garnet embedded in pyroxenes from the maﬁc granulites occurring to the north of CSZ is indicative of the garnet formation via reaction between pyroxenes and plagioclase, which occurred during isobaric cooling (IBC).</p>
					<p>Rocks occurring to the south of CSZ have recorded comparatively higher temperature and pressure (849&#176;C and 9.6 kbar) than those occurring to the north of the CSZ (731&#176;C and 8.6 kbar) using conventional geothermobarometry. The rocks occurring to the north of CSZ have suffered more complex metamorphic histories in comparison to the southern part. Integrating the results of the present ﬁeld and metamorphic studies with the earlier investigations and available geochronological data we suggest that the CSZ could represent a suture zone between two different continental blocks that underwent distinct metamorphic evolution.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0159-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The governing equations for generalized thermodiffusion in an elastic solid are solved. There exists three kinds of dilatational waves and a Shear Vertical (SV) wave in a two-dimensional model of the solid. The reflection phenomena of P and SV waves from free surface of an elastic solid with thermodiffusion is considered. The boundary conditions are solved to obtain a system of four non-homogeneous equations for reflection coefficients. These reflection coefficients are found to depend upon the angle of incidence of P and SV waves, thermodiffusion parameters and other material constants. The numerical values of modulus of the reflection coefficients are presented graphically for different values of thermodiffusion parameters. The dimensional velocities of various plane waves are also computed for different material constants.</p>

				<title>A moving boundary solution for solidification of lava lake and magma intrusion in the presence of time-varying contact temperature</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0169-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the solidification of a lava lake heat is released convectively from the top surface as well as conductively into the country rock from the base, leading to non-uniform solidification. The upper solidified layer grows at a faster rate than the lower solidified layer. Similarly, solidification of magma intrusion within the crust is also non-uniform due to the presence of thermal gradient in the crust. Available analytical solution for solidification of a melt layer assumes only symmetric cooling about the centre of the layer. In the present work a moving boundary solution for thermal evolution and non-uniform solidification of a melt layer incorporating time-varying contact temperature conditions at both of its boundaries is developed. The solution is obtained by using the Fourier spectral approach in the space domain and a modified finite difference scheme in the time domain, and is validated with available analytical solutions for simple cases and a semi-analytical solution for the case involving temperature gradient in the country rock. This solution can be used to analyse solidification of lava lakes and magma intrusions experiencing time-dependent temperature variation at their contacts with the country rock.</p>

				<title>IMF BY dependence of the extent of substorm westward electrojet</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0177-0184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper the duskward extension of the westward auroral electrojet is investigated for substorm intervals on the basis of magnetograms recorded at the Indian Antarctic station, Maitri. The database comprises three years from 1998-2000. Based on an initial study of the magnetograms, an arbitrary local time of 2030 MLT is fixed to define the early manifestation of the substorm westward electrojet. Using this criterion 12 substorms are identified and the possible causes examined. Many of these events are observed to be associated with a moderate to intense ring current.The hourly average of the GSM BY-component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) for the hour preceding the substorm onset at Maitri is negative for most of the events. It is suggested that the azimuthal shift of the auroral electrojets in the southern hemisphere resulting from a negative BY-component of the IMF influences the extent of the substorm westward electrojet. This finding implies that the IMF may have a role in controlling the longitudinal extent of substorm occurrence.</p>

				<title>Water quality assessment of Gautami &#8212; Godavari mangrove estuarine ecosystem of Andhra Pradesh, India during September 2001</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0185-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Some chemical and biological parameters were analysed at sixteen stations in the mangrove ecosystem, of the neighbouring Gautami-Godavari (GG) river estuary and Kakinada (KKD) bay to understand the present status of water quality and the impact of external terrigenous inputs during southwest (SW) monsoon in the study areas. High concentrations of nutrients in the mangrove ecosystem compared to the bay and estuarine ecosystems reveal the importance of this zone as a source of nutrients to the adjacent coastal ecosystems. Low Si :N:P (29 : 4 : 1) ratios in these ecosystems are due to the enrichment of these nutrients through external anthropogenic inputs even after the utilization by phytoplankton in the biological cycle. The mean Chl 𝑏/Chl 𝑎 and Chl 𝑐/Chl 𝑎 ratios and high phaeopigments (Pp) concentrations compared to Chl 𝑏 and high ratios of Chl 𝑎/Pp suggests the possibility of the potential growth of phytoplankton populations in lower light intensity and low turbulent areas of these mangrove ecosystems.</p>

				<title>Climbing ripple structure and associated storm-lamination from a Proterozoic carbonate platform succession: Their environmental and petrogenetic signi¯cance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0199-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Mesoproterozoic Pandikunta Limestone, a shallow water carbonate platform succession in the Pranhita–Godavari Valley, south India, displays well developed climbing ripple lamination and storm deposited structures, such as HCS, wave ripple-lamination, combined-flow ripple-lamination and low angle trough cross-stratification. Different types of stratification developed in calcisiltite with minor amounts of very fine quartz sand and silt. The climbing ripple structures exhibit a complex pattern of superposition of different types (type A, B and S) within cosets pointing to a fluctuating rate of suspension deposition <i>versus</i> bedform migration, and an unsteady character of the flow. Close association of climbing ripple structures, HCS with anisotropic geometry, wavy lamination and combined-flow ripple-lamination suggest that the structures were formed by storm generated combined-flow in a mid-shelf area above the storm wave base. The combined-flow that deposited the climbing ripple structures had a strong unidirectional flow component of variable magnitude. The climbing ripple structure occurs as a constituent of graded stratified beds with an ordered vertical sequence of different types of lamination, reflecting flow deceleration and increased rate of suspension deposition. It is inferred that the beds were deposited from high-density waning flows in the relatively deeper part of the ancient shelf. The structures indicate that the Pandikunta platform was subjected to open marine circulation and intense storm activities.</p>
					<p>The storm deposited beds, intercalated with beds of lime-mudstone, consist primarily of fine sand and silt size carbonate particles that were hydrodynamically similar to quartz silt. Detrital carbonate particles are structureless and are of variable roundness. The particles were generated as primary carbonate clasts in coastal areas by mechanical disintegration of rapidly lithified beds, stromatolites or laminites, and the finest grade was transported to the offshore areas by stormgenerated currents.</p>

				<title>Tidal shelf sedimentation in the Neoproterozoic Chattisgarh succession of central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0211-0226</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Neoproterozoic Kansapathar Sandstone of the Chattisgarh basin, a shallow marine shelf bar sequence, consists of mineralogically and texturally mature sandstones with subordinate siltstones, mudstones and conglomerates. The sediments were transported, reworked and deposited in subtidal environments by strong tidal currents of macrotidal regime as well as storms, and accumulated as discrete shoaling-upward features, separated from each other by muddy to low-energy sandy deposits. The sandbodies developed into shoaling up linear bars, often more than a kilometre in length, through accretion of thick cross-stratified units in transverse directions under the influence of ebb and flood tidal currents, as well as in longitudinal direction affected by southeasterly flowing along-shore currents. The aggrading upper surfaces of the bars experienced protracted reworking by strong oscillatory wave currents leading to extensive development of subaqueous 2D or 3D dunes mantled with lag pebble deposits at different points. With continued shoaling and progradation, thebars amalgamated into large sandstone sheets with the development of high energy beach depositsand coastal sand flats in the uppermost part of the sequence. The presence of rill marks, flat-topped ripples, wrinkle marks, desiccation cracks and adhesion warts point to intertidal conditions with intermittent exposure. The high energy sandstone bars overlie a thick mudstone-dominated shelf sequence across a sharp interface indicating rapid change in the sea-level, provenance, rate of sediment generation and sediment input, and circulation condition in the shelf. A quiet muddy shelf was replaced by a major sand-depositing environment with strong, open marine circulation. An interplay of tidal currents, oscillatory wave currents and storm currents generated a complex flow pattern that varied in time and space from bimodal-bipolar to strongly unimodal flows. Close parallelism of wave ripple crests, trend of linear bars and unidirectional flows suggest that the elongate bars were parallel to sub-parallel to the coastline, and were strongly influenced by along shore drift. The inferred coastline was broadly N{S. The large-scale structures in the bar sandstones, emplacement of vast amount of sand and migration of large bedforms under strong macrotidal currents collectively indicate that the Kansapathar shelf was intimately connected with an open ocean basin towards north-northwest.</p>

				<title>Provenance, tectonics and palaeoclimate of Proterozoic Chandarpur sandstones, Chattisgarh basin: A petrographic view</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0227-0245</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sandstones of early Neoproterozoic Chandarpur Group, Chattisgarh Supergroup, central India display progressive change towards greater textural and mineralogical maturity from base to top of the succession. The clay-silt matrix decreases, sorting of sand grains improves, frequency of rounded grains increases, monocrystalline quartz content increases with concomitant decrease in polycrystalline quartz, feldspar and rock fragments. The trend of variations in different mineralogical and textural attributes, however, exhibits inflections at different stratigraphic levels. The sandstones of the basal Lohardih Formation are alluvial fan deposits, characterized by high matrix and feldspar content, iron-oxide impregnated highly angular grains and poor sorting. Petrographic properties collectively indicate that the sandstones were derived from a weathered granitic crust under a humid climatic condition. Abundance of well rounded grains within the alluvial fan and overlying braided fluvial deposit indicates prolonged wind action during episodes of high aridity. The shallow marine deposit overlying the fluvial deposits in the upper part of the Lohardih Formation exhibits bedto- bed variation in the frequency of angular grains, feldspar content and overall maturity suggesting environmentally controlled segregation of sediments. The abrupt appearance of coarse-grained immature sandstones with concomitant reappearance of iron-oxide impregnated/altered feldspar grains in the upper part of the shelf deposits of the Chaporadih Formation point to a phase of tectonic uplift that possibly triggered a regression. Continued regression and peneplanation heralded the deposition of supermature medium-grained purple quartzarenite of the upper shoreface Kansapathar Formation in the uppermost part of the Chandarpur succession under a hot desertic climatic condition. The provenance analysis revealed that the Chandarpur clastics were derived from granites and granite–gneisses of a continental block tectonic provenance. Petrographic studies further indicate that high grade metamorphic rocks did not make any perceptible contribution to the Chandarpur system. The Eastern Ghats Granulite Belt apparently did not emerge till the early Neoproterozoic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Manganese carbonates interstratified with bedded chert in the Chanda Limestone of the Neoproterozoic Penganga Group at Adilabad, south India, have been studied for possible evidence that microbiota played a role in the mediation of early diagenetic Mn-carbonate formation in Precam- brian marine sedimentary successions. The manganese carbonate and chert beds occur within a below wave base, deep-water distally steepened ramp succession. High resolution SEM petrogra- phy of the manganese carbonates revealed two basic morphologies &#8212; spherical to oval-cylindrical shaped microconcretions, and tubular to irregular, elongated, film-like microstructures. Infolded filmy to hollow tubular strand-like internal morphologies of the spherical to oval-cylindrical shaped microconcretions suggest their microbial affinity. The tubular and film morphologies with mesh- like interconnections closely resemble architectures of microbial extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Mineralization took place on these organotemplates by the process of permineralization as well as replacement in an early diagenetic pore-water environment with reduction of higher manganese oxy-hydroxides by organic matter and consequent increase in dissolved carbonate.</p>

				<title>Pull-apart origin of the Satpura Gondwana basin, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0259-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Gondwana basins of peninsular India are traditionally considered as extensional-rift basins due to the overwhelming evidence of fault-controlled synsedimentary subsidence. These basins indeed originated under a bulk extensional tectonic regime, due to failure of the attenuated crust along pre-existing zones of weakness inherited from Precambrian structural fabrics. However, disposition of the basins and their structural architecture indicate that the kinematics of all the basins cannot be extensional. To maintain kinematic compatibility with other basins as well as the bulk lateral extension, some basins ought to be of strike-slip origin. The disposition, shape and structural architecture of the Satpura basin, central India suggest that the basin could be a pull-apart basin that developed above a releasing jog of a left-stepping strike-slip fault system defined by the Son-Narmada south fault and Tapti north fault in consequence to sinistral displacement along WSW-ENE. Development of a sedimentary basin under the above-mentioned kinematic condition was simulated in model experiments with sandpack. The shape, relative size, stratigraphic and structural architecture of the experimental basin tally with that of the Satpura basin. The experimental results also provide insights into the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Satpura basin in particular and pull-apart basins in general.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Basal part of the Gondwana Supergroup represented by Talchir and Karharbari Formations (Permo-Carboniferous) records an abrupt change-over from glacio-marine to terrestrial fluviolacustrine depositional environment. The contact between the two is an unconformity. Facies analysis of the glacio-marine Talchir Formation reveals that basal glaciogenic and reworked glaciogenic sediments are buried under storm influenced inner and outer shelf sediments. Facies associations of the Karharbari Formation suggest deposition as fluvio-lacustrine deposits in fault-controlled troughs. An attempt has been made in this paper to explain the sedimentation pattern in Talchir and Karharbari basins, and the abrupt change-over from glacio-marine to terrestrial fluviolacustrine depositional environment in terms of glacio-isostacy.</p>

				<title>Facies pattern of the middle Permian Barren Measures Formation, Jharia basin, India: The sedimentary response to basin tectonics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0287-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Lower Gondwana succession of the Jharia basin of eastern India, the Barren Measures Formation is characterized by the cyclic disposition of fine-grained lacustrine deposits and relatively coarse-grained fluvial deposits. The cyclic variation in the rate of coarse clastic input is attributed to the sedimentary response to basin tectonics. The sandstone–shale alternations of the Barren Measures succession can be correlated with the tectonic cyclothems developed on the hangingwall dip-slope and adjoining trough in a continental half-graben setting. Enhancement of the gradient of the hangingwall dip-slope during reactivation of the basin margin faults led to progradation of the existing fluvial system towards the half-graben trough and deposition of the coarser clastics on the fine-grained lacustrine deposits of the trough. Peneplanation of the hangingwall slope and slow increase in the lake level caused lacustrine transgression and retrogration of the fluvial system on the hangingwall block. The fluvial sediments were onlapped by the fine-grained lacustrine deposits. Episodic rejuvenation of the basin margin faults thus caused development of tectonic cyclothem on the hangingwall block. The paleocurrent pattern indicates that a persistent northward paleoslope was maintained during Barren Measures sedimentation. The inferred depositional settings were much more extensive than the present limit of the outcrop. The faults, presently defining the northern limit of the Barren Measures Formation, were possibly emplaced after Barren Measures sedimentation. The final movement along these fault planes caused preservation of the downthrown hangingwall block and the Barren Measures sediments on the footwall block were eroded during subsequent denudation. The Southern Boundary Fault came into existence after the deposition of the Barren Measures sediments.</p>

				<title>Evidence of lacustrine sedimentation in the Upper Permian Bijori Formation, Satpura Gondwana basin: Palaeogeographic and tectonic implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0303-0323</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Upper Permian Bijori Formation of the Satpura Gondwana basin comprising fine- to coarsegrained sandstone, carbonaceous shale/mudstone and thin coal bands was previously interpreted as the deposits of meandering rivers. The present study documents abundance of wave ripples, hummocky and swaley cross-stratification and combined flow bedforms in the Bijori Formation, suggesting that a significant part of the formation was deposited in a wave-agitated environment. Evidence of near-emergent depositional conditions provided by repeated occurrence of rootlet beds and hydromorphic paleosols, local flooding surfaces denoting rapid fluctuation of water level, occurrences of temnospondyl vertebrate fossils, and absence of tidal signatures and marine fossils suggest a lacustrine rather than marine depositional regime. Five facies associations recognised within the Bijori Formation are inferred to represent fluvial channels and associated floodplains (FA1), lake shorelines (FA2), subaqueous distributary channels and associated levees (FA3), wave- and storm-affected delta front (FA4), and open lacustrine/lower shoreface (FA5) deposits. The planoconcave fluvial channel-fill sandbodies with unidirectional cross-beds are clearly distinguishable from the delta front bars that show a convexo-plan or bi-convex sandbody geometry and dominance of wave and combined flow bedforms. Some of the distributary channels record interaction of fluvial and wave-dominated basinal processes. Major distributary sandbodies show a north to northwest flow direction while wave-affected delta front sandbodies show very complex flow patterns reflecting interaction between fluvial discharge and wave processes. Wave ripple crest trends show that the lake shoreline had an overall east–northeast to west–southwest orientation.</p>
					<p>The lack of documented contemporaneous lacustrine or marine sediments in the Satpura Gondwana basin posed a major problem of basin-scale palaeogeographic reconstruction. The existence of Bijori lake solves the problem and the lake is inferred to have acted as repository for the contemporaneous alluvial drainage. Development of the large Bijori lake body implies generation of accommodation space exceeding the rate of sediment supplied and thus represents locus of high tectonic subsidence. Transition of fluvial sediments with red mudstone and calcareous soil profile in the lower part of the succession to carbonaceous shale and coal-bearing lacustrine sediments in the upper part, denote a change from a warm semi-arid climate with seasonal rainfall to a more humid one.</p>

				<title>Depositional setting and vertebrate biostratigraphy of the Triassic Dockum Group of Texas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0325-0351</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Triassic strata of the Dockum Group in Texas comprise two major upward-ﬁning alluvial–lacustrine depositional sequences. The two sequences are represented by the (1) Santa Rosa–Tecovas, and (2) Trujillo–Cooper Canyon Formations. The second sequence is much thicker than the ﬁrst, and occupies a greater geographic part of the Dockum basin. Each sequence of alluvial and lacustrine sediment accumulation is characterized by sediment derivation from a different source terrain. The unconformable relationship between the two depositional sequences, the change in mineralogical composition and presumed source areas between these units, differences in paleocurrent orientation between units, and evidence for intervening episodes of local deformation indicate that the sequences are of tectonic origin. These strata are not the product of a single sediment dispersal system, such as the centripetally-drained lacustrine delta complex previously envisioned for the Dockum basin. Both Dockum sequences are comprised largely of two typical alluvial facies associations; stream channel facies, and overbank ﬂood-plain facies, that are similar to those described in nearly all ﬂuvial deposits. In addition, the Dockum Group contains a peculiar lacustrine facies that accumulated in local ﬂood-plain depressions, and probably resulted from subsidence over areas of subsurface salt dissolution. Vertebrate fossil assemblages are found in all three Dockum facies associations. Five fossiliferous sites in the Dockum are discussed in the context of these three depositional settings. The Dockum tetrapod diversity is reviewed in a hierarchical phylogeny with remarks on the history of collection, stratigraphic distribution of genera, and their taxonomic status. The stratigraphic ranges of tetrapod taxa do not support the recently proposed successive Otischalkian, Adamanian, Revueltian, and Apachean biochrons within the Dockum Group. Instead, a few index fossils provide a broad framework for correlation of Late Triassic nonmarine strata of the Dockum with the Carnian and Norian Alpine marine stages.</p>

				<title>Sedimentary structures of tidal flats: A journey from coast to inner estuarine region of eastern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0353-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sedimentary structures of some coastal tropical tidal ﬂats of the east coast of India, and inner estuarine tidal point bars located at 30 to 50 kilometers inland from the coast, have been extensively studied under varying seasonal conditions. The results reveal that physical features such as ﬂaser bedding, herringbone cross-bedding, lenticular bedding, and mud/silt couplets are common to both the environments. In fact, ﬂaser bedding and lenticular bedding are more common in the point bar facies during the monsoon months than in the coastal tidal ﬂat environments. Interference ripples, though common in both the environments, show different architectural patterns for different environmental domains. Interference ripples with thread-like secondary set overriding the earlier ripple-form, resembling wrinkle marks, are the typical features in estuarine point bars near the high water region. Because structures which are so far considered as key structures for near-coastal tidal ﬂats are common to both the environments, caution should be exercised for deciphering palaeo-environments, particularly for Proterozoic rocks, where one has to depend only on physical sedimentary structures.</p>

					<p>Study of sedimentary pyrite in the form of framboids, euhedral crystals or metasomatic masses has revealed that their surfaces are commonly covered with spheroids of about 50 nm.

					<p>Back scattered electron and transmission electron imaging of lunar soil grains reveal an abundance of submicrometer-sized pure Fe<sup>0</sup>0 globules that occur in the rinds of many soil grains and in the submillimeter sized vesicular glass-cemented grains called agglutinates. Grain rinds are amorphous silicates that were deposited on grains exposed at the lunar surface from transient vapors produced by hypervelocity micrometeorite impacts. Fe<sup>0</sup> may have dissociated from Fe-compounds in a high temperature (&lt; 3000&#176;C) vapor phase and then condensed as globules on grain surfaces. The agglutinitic glass is a quenched product of silicate melts, also produced by micrometeorite impacts on lunar soils. Reduction by solar wind hydrogen in agglutinitic melts may have produced immiscible droplets that solidiﬁed as globules. The exact mechanism of formation of such Fe<sup>0</sup> globules in lunar soils remains unresolved.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sangla valley is situated at an altitude of ∼3500m above mean sea level and lies in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh. It is fed by river Baspa, a tributary of river Sutlej, that entrenches through the Quaternary glaciogenic deposits before emerging out of the valley and joining the river Sutlej at Karcham. The unstratified to stratified glaciogenic deposits consist of large boulders to fine silt and are classified into four major depositional facies on the basis of sedimentary texture and depositional environment. The facies &#8212; basal conglomerates, debris flow, water/sheet flow and laminites &#8212; represents the change in the environment of deposition from glaciofluvial to lacustrine and also the extent of the glacier to the valley floor during late Quaternary.</p>

				<title>Evidence of paleoearthquakes from trench investigations along Pinjore Garden fault in Pinjore Dun, NW Himalaya</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0387-0400</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Pinjore Garden Fault (PGF) striking NNW–SSE is now considered one of the active faults displacing the younger Quaternary surfaces in the piggyback basin of Pinjore Dun. This has displaced the older Kalka and Pinjore surfaces, along with the other younger surfaces giving rise to WSW and SW-facing fault scarps with heights ranging from 2 to 16m. The PGF represents a younger branch of the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) system. An ∼4m wide trench excavated across the PGF has revealed displacement of younger Quaternary deposits along a low angle thrust fault. Either side of the trench-walls reveals contrasting slip-related deformation of lithounits. The northern wall shows displacement of lithounits along a low-angle thrust fault, while the southern wall shows well-developed fault-related folding of thick sand unit. The sudden change in the deformational features on the southern wall is an evidence of the changing fault geometry within a short distance. Out of ﬁve prominent lithounits identiﬁed in the trench, the lower four units show displacement along a single fault. The basal unit ‘A’ shows maximum displacement of about To = 2.85 m, unit B = 1.8m and unit C = 1.45 m. The displacement measured between the sedimentary units and retro-deformation of trench log suggests that at least two earthquake events have occurred along the PGF. The units A and D mark the event horizons. Considering the average amount of displacement during one single event (2m) and the minimum length of the fault trace (∼45 km), the behaviour of PGF seems similar to that of the Himalayan Frontal Fault (HFF) and appears capable of producing large magnitude earthquakes.</p>

				<title>Acceleration of near-field scattering from an inhomogeneous spherical shell</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0401-0410</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The three dimensional scattering of near-field, from a point source, is studied for acceleration in the time domain. The perturbation method is applied to define the acceleration for the first order scattering from a weak inhomogeneity in a homogeneous surrounding. A body force, arising from the interaction between the primary waves and the inhomogeneity, acts as the source generating the scattered motion. The acceleration of scattered waves is related to the velocity and density fluctuations of the inhomogeneity. No restrictions are placed on the inhomogeneity size or locations of the source and receiver. Decoupling of scattered motion enables the identification of different phases. Integral expressions are derived for the scattering acceleration due to the incidence of near-field wave (from an impulsive point force) at a radially inhomogeneous volume element. These integrals are solved further for scattering from an inhomogeneous spherical shell. The accelerations for back scattering are obtained as a special case. These accelerations are simple analytically solvable expressions in closed form.</p>
					<p>Only spherical asymmetry of 𝑃 wave velocity inhomogeneity can affect the scattered 𝑆 acceleration. Scattered 𝑃 acceleration is affected by the gradient of 𝑆 wave velocity inhomogeneity. The back scattering of near-field from a spherical shell, is independent of radial inhomogeneity of 𝑃 wave velocity. Inhomogeneity with smoothly perturbed 𝑆 wave velocity does not back-scatter any acceleration. Accelerations are computed numerically for scattering from a part of inhomogeneous spherical shell. Hypothetical models are considered to study the effects of the distances of spherical shell from source, receiver, its thickness and its position relative to the direction of impulsive force.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Wave propagation is studied in a general anisotropic poroelastic solid saturated with a viscous fluid flowing through its pores of anisotropic permeability. The extended version of Biot's theory is used to derive a system of modified Christoffel equations for the propagation of plane harmonic waves in such media. The non-trivial solution of this system is ensured by a biquadratic equation whose roots represent the complex velocities of four attenuating quasi-waves in the medium. These complex velocities define phase velocity and attenuation of each quasi-wave propagating along a given phase direction in three-dimensional space. The solution itself defines the polarisations of the quasi-waves along with phase shift. The variations of polarisations of quasi-waves with their phase direction, are computed for a realistic numerical model.</p>

				<title>Impact of bogus vortex for track and intensity prediction of tropical cyclone</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0427-0436</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The initialization scheme designed to improve the representation of a tropical cyclone in the initial condition is tested during Orissa super cyclone (1999) over Bay of Bengal using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University &#8212; National Center for Atmospheric Research (Penn State &#8212; NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5). A series of numerical experiments are conducted to generate initial vortices by assimilating the bogus wind information into MM5. Wind speed and location of the tropical cyclone obtained from best track data are used to define maximum wind speed, and centre of the storm respectively, in the initial vortex. The initialization scheme produced an initial vortex that was well adapted to the forecast model and was much more realistic in size and intensity than the storm structure obtained from the NCEP analysis. Using this scheme, the 24-h, 48-h, and 72-h forecast errors for this case was 63, 58, and 46 km, respectively, compared with 120, 335, and 550km for the non-vortex initialized case starting from the NCEP global analysis. When bogus vortices are introduced into initial conditions, the significant improvements in the storm intensity predictions are also seen.</p>
					<p>The impact of the vortex size on the structure of the initial vortex is also evaluated. We found that when the radius of maximum wind (RMW) of the specified vortex is smaller than that of which can be resolved by the model, the specified vortex is not well adapted by the model. In contrast, when the vortex is sufficiently large for it to be resolved on horizontal grid, but not so large to be unrealistic, more accurate storm structure is obtained.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Using the data of amplitude scintillations recorded at 244MHz from the geostationary satellite, FLEETSAT (73&#176;E) at a low latitude station, Waltair (17.7&#176;N, 83.3&#176;E, 20&#176;N dip), during the increasing sunspot activity period of 1997-2000, the effect of the geomagnetic storms on the occurrence of ionospheric scintillations has been studied. A total of 60 SC storms studied during this period, following the Aarons' criterion, reveals that the local time of onset of the recovery phase of the geomagnetic storms play an important role in the generation or inhibition of the ionospheric irregularities. Out of the 60 storms studied, nearly 60 to 70% satisfied the categories I, II and III of Aarons' criteria. However, in the remaining 30 to 40% of the cases, no consistent results were observed. Thus, there is a necessity for further investigation of the effect of geomagnetic storms on ionospheric irregularities, particularly with reference to the altitude variations of the F-layer (h'F) relating to the changes in the local electric fields.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0443-0452</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Changes in the terrigenous sediment source and transport mechanisms during the late Quaternary have been investigated using four sediment cores within the Indian sector of Southern Ocean, using the magnetic susceptibility (MS)and sedimentological records.Sediments deposited during the Holocene and other interglacial periods were characterised by low MS,low sand content, reduced ice-rafted detritus (IRD)input and increased illite possibly transported via hydrographic advection from the south.The glacial intervals are characterised by high MS,high sand content, increased IRD input and reduced illite clays,derived from both local as well as Antarctic sources.  Signiﬁcant reduction in clay fraction and illite content during glacials suggests that the erosive and transporting capabilities of the deep and bottom waters could have reduced compared to the interglacial times.The changes in terrigenous in ﬂux to this region were signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by the rhythmic glacial –interglacial ﬂuctuations in bottom circulation and the position of the Polar Front.</p>

				<title>Palaeoceanographic implications of abundance and mean proloculus diameter of benthic foraminiferal species <i>Epistominella exigua</i> in sub-surface sediments from distal Bay of Bengal fan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0453-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temporal variation in abundance and mean proloculus diameter of the benthic foraminiferal species <i>Epistominella exigua</i> has been reconstructed over the last ∼ 50,000 $yr$ BP,from a core collected from the distal Bay of Bengal fan,to assess its potential application in palaeoceanographic reconstruction studies.The down-core variation shows signiﬁcant change in abundance of <i>E. exigua</i> during the last ∼50,000 $yr$ BP.In view of the present day abundance of this species from areas with strong seasonal organic matter supply, we conclude that at ∼7, ∼22, ∼33 and ∼46 $kyr$ BP, strong seasonality prevailed in the distal Bay of Bengal fan,probably indicating either strong or prolonged north–east monsoon or weakened south–west monsoon.For the ﬁrst time,a strong correlation is observed in abundance and mean proloculus diameter of <i>E. exigua</i> Based on coherent variation in mean proloculus diameter and abundance,it is postulated that mean proloculus diameter can also be used to infer increased seasonality in organic matter production,thus variation in strength or duration of monsoon.Thus,this study establishes that the down-core variation in the abundance and mean proloculus diameter of <i>Epistominella exigua</i> can be used to infer past climatic variations from the distal Bay of Bengal fan.</p>

				<title>Hydrography of the eastern Arabian Sea during summer monsoon 2002</title>

				<page>0459-0474</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrographic observations in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS)during summer monsoon 2002 (during the ﬁrst phase of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX))include two approximately fortnight-long CTD time series.A barrier layer was observed occasionally during the two time series. These ephemeral barrier layers were caused by <i>in situ</i> rainfall,and by advection of low-salinity (high-salinity)waters at the surface (below the surface mixed layer).These barrier layers were advected away from the source region by the West India Coastal Current and had no discernible effect on the sea surface temperature.The three high-salinity water masses,the Arabian Sea High Salinity Water (ASHSW),Persian Gulf Water (PGW),and Red Sea Water (RSW),and the Arabian Sea Salinity Minimum also exhibited intermittency:they appeared and disappeared during the time series.The concentration of the ASHSW,PGW,and RSWdecreased equatorward,and that of the RSW also decreased offshore.The observations suggest that the RSW is advected equatorward along the continental slope off the Indian west coast.</p>

				<title>Hydrography and water masses in the southeastern Arabian Sea during March-June 2003</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the hydrographic observations in the southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS)during two cruises carried out in March –June 2003 as part of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment.The surface hydrography during March –April was dominated by the intrusion of low-salinity waters from the south;during May –June,the low-salinity waters were beginning to be replaced by the high- salinity waters from the north.There was considerable mixing at the bottom of the surface mixed layer,leading to interleaving of low-salinity and high-salinity layers.The ﬂow paths constructed following the spatial patterns of salinity along the sections mimic those inferred from numerical models.Time-series measurements showed the presence of Persian Gulf and Red Sea Waters in the SEAS to be intermittent during both cruises:they appeared and disappeared during both the fortnight-long time series.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP)of India,as a whole,faces a severe shortage of water despite receiving a high annual rainfall,this is primarily due to excess runoff and lack of water conservation practices.In this study,an attempt is made to identify zones favourable for the application and adaptation of site-speciﬁc artiﬁcial-recharge techniques for augmentation of groundwater through a Geographical Information System (GIS)based hydrogeomorphic approach in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins of Thane district,in western DVP.The criteria adopted for the GIS analysis were based on the hydrogeomorphological characteristics of both basins extracted from the IRS- 1C LISS-III data supported by information on drainage pattern,DEM derived slope,lineament density,drainage density,and groundwater condition.The integrated study helps design a suitable groundwater management plan for a basaltic terrain.</p>

				<title>Identification of groundwater prospective zones by using remote sensing and geoelectrical methods in Jharia and Raniganj coalfields, Dhanbad district, Jharkhand state</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0515-0522</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Dhanbad district in Jharkhand faces acute water scarcity and is chronically drought-prone. The groundwater resources in the area have not been fully exploited.The present study was undertaken to evaluate the groundwater prospective zones.Landsat-5 Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS)data of band 2 and band 4 and false colour composite (FCC)of band 2,3,4 were interpreted visually to  differentiate different hydromorphogeological units and to delineate the major trends of lineaments.The different geomorphic features identiﬁed are linear ridges, residual hills,and pediplain,buried pediment and dissected pediplain,besides lineaments.The study shows that the pediplain and buried pediments are promising zones for groundwater prospecting.The occurrence and movement of groundwater is restricted to the unconsolidated material, weathered and fractured rocks.For the selection of tube well sites,geoelectrical resistivity investigations have been carried out at the sites,which were found suitable based on hydro-geomorphological and hydrogeological studies.Twenty-six Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) have been carried out by using Schlumberger electrode con ﬁguration,which have brought out 3 to 7 layered sub-surface layers.The resistivity of water-bearing weathered/fractured rocks varies from 120 –150 ohmm.The integrated studies have revealed that the blue colour zones are most promising for groundwater exploration and dug wells may be dug up to depths of 30 ± 5m.</p>

				<title>Normalized impedance function and the straightforward inversion scheme for magnetotelluric data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0523-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper investigates the performance of normalized response function obtained by normalizing the Cagniard impedance function by a suitable factor and then rotating the phase by 45&#176; to make it purely real for homogeneous half-space and equal to the square root of the half-space resistivity.Two apparent resistivity functions based on respectively the real and imaginary parts of this response function are proposed.The apparent resistivity function using the real part contains almost the same information as that yielded by the Cagniard expression while the one using the imaginary part qualitatively works as an indicator of the number of interfaces in the earth model.The linear straightforward inversion scheme (SIS),developed by the authors employing the concept of equal penetration layers,has been used to validate the proposed apparent resistivity functions.For this purpose,several synthetic and ﬁeld models have been examined.Five synthetic models are studied to establish the veracity of the new functions and two well-studied published ﬁeld data sets are inverted through SIS for comparison.We noticed that the new function and SIS compliment each other and lead to better understanding of the data information and model resolution.</p>

				<title>River water quality in weathered limestone: A case study in upper Mahanadi basin, India</title>

				<page>0533-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stromatolitic limestone and calcareous shale belonging to Chattisgarh Supergroup of Proterozoic age dominate the upper part of the Mahanadi river basin.X-ray diffractogram (XRD)of limestone rocks show presence of a signiﬁcant amount of calcite,dolomite and ankerite.Shales of various colours contain calcite and dolomite.It is observed that congruent dissolution of carbonate minerals in the Charmuria pure limestone has given rise to a typical karst topography.On the other hand, limestones are also seen to support red and black soil pro ﬁles.This indicates that the limestone bedrock undergoes a parallel incongruent weathering,which leaves a residue of decomposed rock. The XRD analyses reveal that the limestone soils thus formed contain an assemblage of quartz,clays and Fe-oxides.It is likely that the silicate component trapped during deposition of the stromatolitic limestone  weathers incongruently resulting in diverse soil proﬁles.Carbonate and silicate mineral weathering schemes have been worked out to explain the soil formation,ﬁxation of Al in clay minerals, and Fe in goethite.The water quality parameters such as Ca, Mg and HCO<sub>3</sub> in the river water suggest under saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite.The mineral stability diagrams indicate that kaolinite and Ca-smectite are stable in the river water environment,hence they occur  in suspended sediments and soils.The dominant inﬂuence of carbonate weathering on the water quality is observed even in the downstream part of the river outside the limestone terrain.</p>

				<title>Climatic control on clay mineral formation: Evidence from weathering profiles developed on either side of the Western Ghats</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0545-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many physico-chemical variables like rock-type,climate,topography and exposure age affect weathering environments.In the present study,an attempt is made to understand how the nature of clay minerals formed due to weathering  differs in tropical regions receiving high and low rainfall. Clay mineralogy of weathering pro ﬁles in west coast of India,which receives about 3 m rainfall through  two monsoons and those from the inland rain-shadow zones (&gt; 200 cm rainfall)are studied using X-ray diffraction technique.In the west coast,1:1 clays (kaolinite)and Fe –Al oxides (gibb-site/goethite)are dominant clay minerals in the weathering pro ﬁles while 2:1 clay minerals are absent or found only in trace amounts.Weathering pro ﬁles in the rain shadow region have more complex clay mineralogy and are dominated by 2:1 clays and kaolinite.Fe –Al oxides are either less or absent in clay fraction.The kaolinite –smectite interstrati ﬁed mineral in Banasandra pro ﬁles are  formed due to transformation of smectites to kaolinite,which is indicative of a humid paleo-climate. In tropical regions receiving high rainfall the clay mineral assemblage remains the same irrespective of the parent rock type.Rainfall and availability of water apart from temperature, are the most important factors that determine kinetics of chemical weathering.Mineral alteration reactions proceed through different pathways in water rich and water poor environments.</p>

Fourier technique is used to resolve the wind ﬁeld into a spectrum of waves.Correlation analysis between All India Seasonal Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR)and energetics of the waves indicates that effective kinetic energy of waves 1,3 and 4 around 37.5&#176;N in February has signiﬁcant correlation (99.9%)with the subsequent AISMR.A simple linear regression equation between the effective kinetic energy of these three waves and AISMR is developed.Out of 47 years ’ (1958 –2004)data,32 years (1958 –1989)are utilized for developing the regression model and the remaining 15 years (1990 –2004)are considered for its veri ﬁcation.Predicted AISMR is in close agreement with observed AISMR.The regression equation based on the dynamics of the planetary waves is thus useful for Long Range Forecasting (LRF)of AISMR.Apart from the regression equation,the study provides qualitative predictors.The scatter diagram between AISMR and effective kinetic energy of waves 1,3 and 4 around 37.5&#176;N indicates that if the kinetic energy is more (less)than 5m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup> ,the subsequent monsoon will be good (weak).Stream function ﬁelds indicate that high latitude trough axis along 40&#176;E(70&#176;E) leads to a good (weak)monsoon over India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Based on the inherent property of symmetry of air pollution models,a Symmetrical Air Pollution Model Index (SAPMI)has been developed to calibrate the accuracy of predictions made by such models,where the initial quantity of release at the source is not known.For exact prediction the value of SAPMI should be equal to 1.If the predicted values are overestimating then SAPMI is &gt; 1and if it is underestimating then SAPMI is &lt; 1.Speciﬁc design for the layout of receptors has been suggested as a requirement for the calibration experiments.SAPMI is applicable for all variations of symmetrical air pollution dispersion models.</p>

				<title>Lunar science: An overview</title>

				<page>0587-0591</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Before spacecraft exploration,facts about the Moon were restricted to information about the lunar orbit,angular momentum and density.Speculations about composition and origin were unconstrained.Naked eye and telescope observations revealed two major terrains,the old heavily cratered highlands and the younger mostly circular,lightly cratered maria.The lunar highlands were thought to be composed of granite or covered with volcanic ash-ﬂows.The maria were thought to be sediments,or were full of dust,and possibly only a few million years old.A few perceptive observers such as Ralph Baldwin (Baldwin 1949)concluded that the maria were ﬁlled with volcanic lavas,  but the absence of terrestrial-type central volcanoes like Hawaii was a puzzle.</p>
					<p>The large circular craters were particularly difficult to interpret.Some thought,even after the Apollo ﬂights,that they were some analogue to terrestrial caldera (e.g.,Green 1971),formed by explosive volcanic activity and that the central peaks were volcanoes.The fact that the craters were mostly circular was difficult to accommodate if they were due to meteorite impact,as meteorites would hit the Moon at all angles.The rilles were taken by many as de ﬁnitive evidence that there was or had been,running water on the lunar surface.Others such as Carl Sagan thought that organic compounds were likely present (see Taylor 1975,p.111,note 139).</p>

				<title>Capture of interplanetary bodies in geocentric orbits and early lunar evolution</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0601-0607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the accretion of planets such as Earth,which are formed by collisional accretion of plan-etesimals,the probability of capture of interplanetary bodies in planetocentric orbits is calculated following the approach of Hills (1973)and the 𝑛 -body simulation,using simplectic integration method.The simulation,taking an input mass equal to about 50%of the present mass of the inner planets,distributed over a large number of planetoids,starting at 4 My after the formation of solar system,yielded four inner planets within a period of 30 My.None of these seed bodies,out of which the planets formed,remained at this time and almost 40%mass was transferred beyond 100 AU. Based on these calculations, we conclude that ∼1.4 times the mass of the present inner planets was needed to accumulate them.The probability of capture of planetoids in geocentric orbits is found to be negligible.The result emphasizes the computational difficulty in ‘probability of capture ’of planetesimals around the Earth before the giant impact.This conclusion,however,is in contradiction to the recent observations of asteroids being frequently captured in transient orbits around the Earth,even when the current population of such interplanetary bodies is smaller by several orders of magnitude compared to the planetary accumulation era.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0613-0618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Moon-to-Earth low energy trajectories of ‘detour ’type are found and studied within the frame of the Moon –Earth –Sun-particle system.These trajectories use a passive ﬂight to the Earth from an initial elliptic selenocentric orbit with a high aposelenium.The Earth perturbation increases the particle selenocentric energy from a negative value ﬁrst to zero and then to a positive one and therefore leads to a passive escape of the particle motion from the Moon attraction near the translunar libration point $L_2$. This results in the particle ﬂight to a distance of about 1.5 million km from the Earth where the Sun gravitation decreases the particle orbit perigee distance to a small value that leads to the particle approaching the Earth vicinity in about 100 days of the ﬂight.A set of the Moon-to-Earth ‘detour ’trajectories is de ﬁned numerically.Characteristics of these trajectories are presented.The ‘detour ’trajectories give essential economy of energy (about 150 m/s in Delta V)relative to the usual ones.</p>

					<p>Numerical investigations have been carried out to analyse the evolution of lunar circular orbits and the inﬂuence of the higher order harmonics of the lunar gravity ﬁeld.The aim is to select the appropriate near-circular orbit characteristics,which extend orbit life through passive orbit maintenance.The spherical harmonic terms that make major contributions to the orbital behaviour are identiﬁed through many case studies.It is found that for low circular orbits,the 7th and the 9th zonal harmonics have predominant effect in the case of orbits for which the evolution is stable and the life is longer,and also in the case of orbits for which the evolution is unstable and a crash takes place in a short duration.By analysing the contribution of the harmonic terms to the orbit behaviour,the appropriate near-circular orbit characteristics are identiﬁed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Among many scientiﬁc objectives of lunar exploration, investigations on lunar soil become attractive due to the existence of He<sup>3</sup> and ilmenite in the lunar soil and their possible utilization as nuclear fuel for power generation.Although the composition of the lunar surface soil can be determined by optical and 𝛾/X-ray spectrometers, etc., the evaluation of the total reserves of He<sup>3</sup> and ilmenite within the regolith and in the lunar interior are still not available.In this paper,we give a rough analysis of the microwave brightness temperature images of the lunar disc observed using the NRAO 12 meter Telescope and Siberian Solar Radio Telescope.We also present the results of the microwave dielectric properties of terrestrial analogues of lunar soil and,discuss some basic relations between the microwave brightness temperature and lunar soil properties.</p>

				<title>The Clementine mission – A 10-year perspective</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0645-0668</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clementine was a technology demonstration mission jointly sponsored by the Department of Defense (DOD)and NASA that was launched on January 25th, 1994. Its principal objective was to use the Moon, a near-Earth asteroid, and the spacecraft’s Interstage Adapter as targets to demonstrate lightweight sensor performance and several innovative spacecraft systems and technologies. The design, development, and operation of the Clementine spacecraft and ground system was per-formed by the Naval Research Laboratory. For over two months Clementine mapped the Moon, producing the ﬁrst multispectral global digital map of the Moon, the ﬁrst global topographic map, and contributing several other important scientiﬁc discoveries, including the possibility of ice at the lunar South Pole. New experiments or schedule modiﬁcations were made with minimal constraints, maximizing science return, thus creating a new paradigm for mission operations. Clementine was the ﬁrst mission known to conduct an in-ﬂight autonomous operations experiment. After leaving the Moon, Clementine suffered an onboard failure that caused cancellation of the asteroid rendezvous. Despite this setback, NASA and the DOD applied the lessons learned from the Clementine mission to later missions. Clementine set the standard against which new small spacecraft missions are commonly measured. More than any other mission, Clementine has the most in ﬂuence (scientiﬁcally, technically, and operationally) on the lunar missions being planned for the next decade.</p>

				<title>Advances in lunar science from the Clementine mission: A decadal perspective</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0669-0686</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Clementine spacecraft orbited the Moon and acquired science data for 10 weeks in the Spring of 1994. During this time it collected global 11-band multispectral images and near global altimetry. Select areas of the Moon were imaged at 25 m/pixel in visible light and 60 m/pixel in thermal wavelengths. From these datasets a new paradigm for the evolution of the lunar crust emerged. The Moon is no longer viewed as a two-terrane planet, the Apollo samples were found not to represent the lunar crust as a whole, and the complexity of lunar crustal stratigraphy was further revealed. More than ten years later the Clementine datasets continue to signiﬁcantly advance lunar science and will continue to do so as new measurements are returned from planned missions such as Chandrayaan, SELENE, and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. This paper highlights the scientiﬁc research conducted over the last decade using Clementine data and summarizes the inﬂuence of Clementine on our understanding of the Moon.</p>

				<title>Chandrayaan-1: Science goals</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0699-0709</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The primary objectives of the Chandrayaan-1 mission are simultaneous chemical,mineralogical and topographic mapping of the lunar surface at high spatial resolution.These data should enable us to understand compositional variation of major elements,which in turn,should lead to a better understanding of the stratigraphic relationships between various litho units occurring on the lunar surface.The major element distribution will be determined using an X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometer (LEX),sensitive in the energy range of 1 –10 keV where Mg,Al,Si,Ca and Fe give their K 𝛼 lines.A solar X-ray monitor (SXM)to measure the energy spectrum of solar X-rays,which are responsible for the ﬂuorescent X-rays,is included.Radioactive elements like Th will be measured by its 238.6 keV line using a low energy gamma-ray spectrometer (HEX)operating in the 20 –250 keV region.The mineral composition will be determined by a hyper-spectral imaging spectrometer (HySI)sensitive in the 400 –920 nm range.The wavelength range is further extended to 2600 nm where some spectral features of the abundant lunar minerals and water occur,by using a near-infrared spectrometer (SIR-2),similar to that used on the Smart-1 mission,in collaboration with ESA.A terrain mapping camera (TMC)in the panchromatic band will provide a three-dimensional map of the lunar surface with a spatial resolution of about 5 m.Aided by a laser altimeter (LLRI) to determine the altitude of the lunar craft,to correct for spatial coverage by various instruments, TMC should enable us to prepare an elevation map with an accuracy of about 10 m.</p>
					<p>Four additional instruments under international collaboration are being considered.These are: a Miniature Imaging Radar Instrument (mini-SAR),Sub Atomic Re ﬂecting Analyser (SARA), the Moon Mineral Mapper (M3)and a Radiation Monitor (RADOM).Apart from these scientiﬁc payloads,certain technology experiments have been proposed,which may include an impactor which will be released to land on the Moon during the mission.</p>
					<p>Salient features of the mission are described here.The ensemble of instruments onboard Chandrayaan-1 should enable us to accomplish the science goals de ﬁned for this mission.</p>

				<title>Launch strategy for Indian lunar mission and precision injection to the Moon using genetic algorithm</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0711-0716</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 will have a mass of 523 kg in a 100 km circular polar orbit around the Moon.The main factors that dictate the design of the Indian Moon mission are to use the present capability of launch vehicles and to achieve the scientiﬁc objectives in the minimum development time and cost.The detailed mission planning involves trade-off studies in payload optimization and the transfer trajectory determination that accomplishes these requirements.Recent studies indicate that for an optimal use of the existing launch vehicle and space- craft systems,highly elliptical inclined orbits are preferable.This indeed is true for the Indian Moon mission Chandrayaan-1.The proposed launch scenario of the Indian Moon mission program and capabilities of this mission are described in this paper,highlighting the design challenges and innovations.Further,to reach the target accurately,appropriate initial transfer trajectory characteristics must be chosen.A numerical search for the initial conditions combined with numerical integration produces the near accurate solution for this problem.The design of such transfer trajectories is discussed in this paper.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC)on India ’s ﬁrst satellite for lunar exploration,Chandrayaan-1, is for generating high-resolution 3-dimensional maps of the Moon.With this instrument,a complete topographic map of the Moon with 5 m spatial resolution and 10-bit quantization will be available for scienti ﬁc studies.The TMC will image within the panchromatic spectral band of 0.4 to 0.9 𝜇 m with a stereo view in the fore,nadir and aft directions of the spacecraft movement and have a B/H ratio of 1.The swath coverage will be 20 km.The camera is conﬁgured for imaging in the push broom-mode with three linear detectors in the image plane.The camera will have four gain settings to cover the varying illumination conditions of the Moon.Additionally,a provision of imaging with reduced resolution,for improving Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)in polar regions,which have poor illumination conditions throughout,has been made.SNR of better than 100 is expected in the ± 60&#176; latitude region for mature mare soil,which is one of the darkest regions on the lunar surface. This paper presents a brief description of the TMC instrument.</p>

				<title>Lunar ranging instrument for Chandrayaan-1</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0725-0731</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI)proposed for the ﬁrst Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 is aimed to study the topography of the Moon ’s surface and its gravitational ﬁeld by precisely measuring the altitude from a polar orbit around the Moon.Altimetry data close to the poles of the Moon would also be available from the instrument,which was not covered by earlier missions. This instrument supplements the terrain mapping camera and hyper-spectral imager payloads on Chandrayaan-1.The instrument consists of a diode pumped Nd:YAG pulsed laser transmitter having 10 nsec pulse width and a receiver system.The receiver system features 17 cm diameter Ritchey –Chrétien collecting optics,Si Avalanche Photo Detector (APD),preampli ﬁers,constant fraction discriminators,time-of-ﬂight measurement unit and spacecraft interface.Altimeter resolution of better than 5 m is targeted.The received signal strength of LLRI depends on laser pulse backscatter from the Moon ’s surface.Moon ’s surface being a poor re ﬂector,the choice of receiver size and its type and the selection of detector play an important role in getting a good signal-to-noise ratio and in turn achieving the target resolution.At the same time,the spacecraft puts a limitation on payload size and weight.This paper discusses the proposed LLRI system for Chandrayaan-1 and signal-to-noise ratio estimation.</p>

				<title>High energy 𝛾 X-ray  spectrometer on the Chandrayaan-1 mission to the Moon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0733-0738</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Chandrayaan-1 mission to the Moon scheduled for launch in late 2007 will include a high energy X-ray spectrometer (HEX) for detection of naturally occurring emissions from the lunar surface due to radioactive decay of the <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>Th series nuclides in the energy region 20 –250 keV.The primary science objective is to study the transport of volatiles on the lunar surface by detection of the 46.5 keV line from radioactive <sup>210</sup>Pb, a decay product of the gaseous <sup>222</sup>Rn, both of which are members of the <sup>238</sup>U decay series. Mapping of U and Th concentration over the lunar surface, particularly in the polar and U –Th rich regions will also be attempted through detection of prominent lines from the U and Th decay series in the above energy range.The low signal strengths of these emissions require a detector with high sensitivity and good energy resolution.Pixelated Cadmium – Zinc –Telluride (CZT)array detectors having these characteristics will be used in this experiment. Here we describe the science considerations that led to this experiment,anticipated ﬂux and back- ground (lunar continuum),the choice of detectors,the proposed payload con ﬁguration and plans for its realization.</p>

				<title>Imaging and power generation strategies for Chandrayaan-1</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0739-0748</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Chandrayaan-1 mission proposes to put a 550 kg lunarcraft into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO)using the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)which will subsequently be transferred into a 100 km circular lunar polar orbit for imaging purposes.In this paper,we describe certain aspects of mission strategies which will allow optimum power generation and imaging of the lunar surface.</p>
					<p>The lunar orbit considered is circular and polar and therefore nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.Unlike an Earth orbiting remote sensing satellite,the orbit plane of lunar orbiter is inertially ﬁxed as a consequence of the very small oblateness of the Moon.The Earth rotates around the Sun once a year,resulting in an apparent motion of Sun around this orbit in a year.Two extreme situations can be identiﬁed concerning the solar illumination of the lunar orbit,noon/midnight orbit,where the Sun vector is parallel to the spacecraft orbit plane and dawn/dusk orbit,where the Sun vector is perpendicular to the spacecraft orbit plane.This scenario directly affects the solar panel conﬁguration.In case the solar panels are not canted,during the noon/midnight orbit, 100%power is generated,whereas during the dawn/dusk orbit,zero power is generated.Hence for optimum power generation,canting of the panels is essential.Detailed analysis was carriedout to ﬁx optimum canting and also determine a strategy to maintain optimum power generation throughout the year.The analysis led to the strategy of 180&#176; yaw rotation at noon/midnight orbits and ﬂipping the solar panel by 180&#176; at dawn/dusk orbits.This also resulted in the negative pitch face of the lunarcraft to be an anti-sun panel,which is very useful for thermal design,and further to meet cooling requirements of the spectrometers.</p>
					<p>In principle the Moon ’s surface can be imaged in 28 days,because the orbit chosen and the payload swath provide adequate overlap.However,in reality it is not possible to complete the imaging in 28 days due to various mission constraints like maximum duration of imaging allowed keeping in view the SSR sizing and payloads data input rate,time required for downlinking the payload data,data compression requirements and visibility of the lunarcraft for the Bangalore DSN. In each cycle,all the latitudes are swept.Due to the constraints mentioned,only 60&#176; latitude arc coverage is possible in each orbit.As Bangalore DSN is the only station,half of the orbits in a day are not available.The longitudinal gaps because of non-visibility are covered in the next cycle by Bangalore DSN.Hence,in the ﬁrst <i>prime imaging season</i> only 25% of the prime imaging zones are covered,and an additional three <i>prime imaging seasons</i> are required for a full coverage of the Moon in two years.Strategy is also planned to cover X-ray payload coverage considering swath and orbit shift.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0749-0760</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports on the Sub-keV Atom Reﬂecting Analyzer (SARA)experiment that will be ﬂown on the ﬁrst Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1.The SARA is a low energy neutral atom (LENA)imaging mass spectrometer,which will perform remote sensing of the lunar surface via detection of neutral atoms in the energy range from 10 eV to 3 keV from a 100 km polar orbit.In this report we present the basic design of the SARA experiment and discuss various scientiﬁc issues that will be addressed.The SARA instrument consists of three major subsystems:a LENA sensor (CENA),a solar wind monitor (SWIM),and a digital processing unit (DPU).SARA will be used to image the solar wind –surface interaction to study primarily the surface composition and surface magnetic anomalies and associated mini-magnetospheres.Studies of lunar exosphere sources and space weathering on the Moon will also be attempted.SARA is the ﬁrst LENA imaging mass spectrometer of its kind to be ﬂown on a space mission.A replica of SARA is planned to ﬂy to Mercury onboard the BepiColombo mission.</p>

				<title>Lunar-A mission: Outline and current status</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0761-0768</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The scientiﬁc objective of the Lunar-A,Japanese Penetrator Mission,is to explore the lunar interior by seismic and heat-ﬂow experiments.Two penetrators containing two seismometers (horizontal and vertical components)and heat-ﬂow probes will be deployed from a spacecraft onto the lunar surface,one on the near-side and the other on the far-side of the moon.The data obtained by the penetrators will be transmitted to the earth station via the Lunar-A mother spacecraft orbiting at an altitude of about 200 km.</p>
					<p>The spacecraft of a cylindrical shape,2.2 m in maximum diameter and 1.7 m in height,is designed to be spin-stabilized.The spacecraft will be inserted into an elliptic lunar orbit,after about a half- year cruise during which complex manoeuvering is made using the lunar-solar gravity assist.After lunar orbit insertion,two penetrators will be separated from the spacecraft near perilune,one by one,and will be landed on the lunar surface.</p>
					<p>The ﬁnal impact velocity of the penetrator will be about 285 m/sec;it will encounter a shock of about 8000 G at impact on the lunar surface.According to numerous experimental impact tests using model penetrators and a lunar-regolith analog target,each penetrator is predicted to penetrate to a depth between l and 3 m,depending on the hardness and/or particle-size distribution of the lunar regolith.The penetration depth is important for ensuring the temperature stability of the instruments in the penetrator and heat ﬂow measurements.According to the results of the Apollo heat ﬂow experiment,an insulating regolith blanket of only 30 cm is sufficient to dampen out about 280 K lunar surface temperature ﬂuctuation to &gt; 3K variation.</p>
					<p>The seismic observations are expected to provide key data on the size of the lunar core,as well as data on deep lunar mantle structure.The heat ﬂow measurements at two penetrator-landing sites will also provide important data on the thermal structure and bulk concentrations of heat- generating elements in the Moon.These data will provide much stronger geophysical constraints on the origin and evolution of the Moon than has been obtained so far.</p>
					<p>Currently,the Lunar-A system is being reviewed and a more robust system for communication between the penetrators and spacecraft is being implemented according to the lessons learned from Beagle-2 and DS-2 failures.More impact tests for penetrators onto a lunar regolith analogue target will be undertaken before its launch.</p>

				<page>0769-0775</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) project started as a joint mission of the former ISAS (Institute of Space and Astronautical Science) and the former NASDA (National Space Development Agency: the two organizations were merged into JAXA in 2002) of Japan in 1998. The launch target is rescheduled for 2006 due to delay of completion of launch vehicle, H-IIA. The SELENE project is now under a sustained design phase. The flight model components were manufactured, and the interface tests between the bus-system and the mission instruments were completed by the end of March 2004. The functional checks and calibration for the flight model components are being carried out at present. From the beginning of 2005, the final assembly tests will start.</p>

				<title>Space operation system for Chang’E program and its capability evaluation</title>

				<page>0795-0799</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Space operation for China ’s ﬁrst lunar exploration program,Chang ’E will be provided by the S-band aerospace Telemetry,Tracking and Command (TT&amp;C)network designed for China ’s manned space program.This is undoubtedly a great challenge to the ground TT&amp;C system.The largest antennas of China ’s S-band aerospace TT&amp;C network has an aperture of only 12 m.A series of technical measures have been taken into the designing of the spacecraft-ground TT&amp;C system to ensure that such antennas can communicate with Chang ’E-1 lunar probe 400,000 km away.These include installation of high-gain directional antennae and medium-gain omni-directional antennae for the probe,adding channel encoding to the downlink channel,using both high and low data rates for information transmission and upgrade and design of ground equipment terminals.Among them,the omni-directional antenna will operate in the earth-ground transfer orbit phase and the directional antenna will operate in the lunar orbit phase.These measures satisfy the spacecraft- ground link and program design requirements.</p>
					<p>To provide accurate navigation for the probe during its Earth –Moon ﬂight and initial lunar orbiting ﬂight,China ’s VLBI system designed for astronomical observations,will also be used besides the ranging and range rate measurement capabilities of the S-band TT&amp;C network.The purpose is to provide 100 m accuracy in position determination during lunar orbit.This paper describes the system design,technical challenges,solutions and capability evaluation of space operation for Chang ’E-1.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Optimal trajectory design of a probe for soft landing on the Moon from a lunar parking orbit by minimizing the fuel required is obtained.The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with the thrust direction being the control variable.Using the maximum principle of Pontryagin, the control variable is expressed as a function of co-state variables and the problem is converted into a two-point boundary value problem.The two-point boundary value problem is solved using an optimization technique,i.e.,controlled random search.The strategies such as</p>

				<title>Proterozoic intracontinental basin: The Vindhyan example</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0003-0022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Vindhyan basin is a classic example of Proterozoic intracontinental basin that developed in the central part of the Indian shield along with several other basins such as Cuddapah,Chattisgarh,etc.The strata are exposed in three major sectors:Son valley,Bundelkhand and Rajasthan. Substantially thick Vindhyan rocks have also been recognized under the Gangetic alluvium.The constituent stratigraphic units of the Vindhyan Supergroup are laterally correlatable and vertically stacked in similar fashion in individual sectors,but their stratigraphic and sedimentologic attributes vary from one sector to the other.The basin ﬁll in the Son valley (around 3 km thick) exhibits an asymmetric cross-sectional geometry normal to the regional strike (ENE –WSW),with the thickest part occurring to the south,and is divisible into four groups:Semri,Kaimur,Rewa and Bhander,from bottom to top.The boundary between the Semri and Kaimur Groups is marked by a pronounced unconformity.The dominant lithologies include conglomerate,sandstone,shale, limestone as well as volcaniclastics.The Vindhyan strata de ﬁne a broad,regional syncline trending ENE –WSW.The axis of the syncline is slightly curved (convex towards north)and plunges gently towards west.The average dip of the southern limb is greater than that of the northern limb rendering the axial plane to dip southerly.</p>
					<p>The Vindhyan succession can be divided into ﬁve major sequences separated by unconformities. The unconformities are manifested in the ﬁeld by angular discordances and/or long-term subaerial exposure features.Unconformity surfaces are disposed in the succession de ﬁning what is known as progressive unconformity,indicating contemporaneous tectonic activity during sedimentation. Individual sequences comprise of a spectrum of depositional systems that include alluvial fan, fan delta,braidplain,braidplain delta,eolian sandsheet,siliciclastic/carbonate tidal ﬂat,siliciclas- tic/carbonate shoreface,siliciclastic/carbonate shelf.The paleocurrents revealed by the Vindhyan strata are typically northerly suggesting that the evolving Satpura orogen served as the source for the Vindhyan sediments.However,the source for the clastics occurring within the Semri and the lower parts of the Kaimur and Rewa Groups in the Bundelkhand sector was perhaps the Bundelkhand Granite Gneiss,Bijawar and Gwalior Group of rocks as manifested by the southerly paleocurrent.</p>
					<p>The sequences of the Vindhyan succession are composed of several systems tracts.The different paleogeographic settings characterizing the systems tracts within individual sequences are as follows:</p>
					<p>Sequence 1:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST – alluvial fan–fan delta–shelf (Deoland and Arangi Formations)</li>
						<li>HST – carbonate ramp (Kajrahat Formation)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 2:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST – shelf (Deonar Formation)</li>
						<li>FSST to TST – braid/fan delta–shelf (Koldaha Formation)</li>
						<li>HST – tidal flat–shoreface–shelf (Chorhat and Koldaha Formations)</li>
						<li>TST – shelf (Rampur Formation)</li>
						<li>TST – carbonate ramp (Rohtas Formation)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 3:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST – shoreface–shelf (Sasaram Formation)</li>
						<li>FSST – shoreface (Ghaghar Formation)</li>
						<li>TST – shelf (Bijaygarh Formation)</li>
						<li>HST – braidplain–braid delta–shelf (Mageswar and Dhandraul Formations)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 4:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST – shelf (Panna Formation)</li>
						<li>FSST to TST – shoreface (Assan and Jhri Formations)</li>
						<li>HST – braidplain–braid delta–shelf (Jhiri, Drammondgunj and Govindgarh Formations)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Sequence 5:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TST – tidal flat (Ganurgarh Formation)</li>
						<li>HST – carbonate platform (Bhander Formartion)</li>
						<li>TST – tidal flat to coastal lagoon (Bundihill and Sirbu Formations)</li>
						<li>FSST – tidal flat–braidplain–eolian (Shikhaoda Formation)</li>

				<title>Outcrop signatures of relative sea level fall on a siliciclastic shelf: Examples from Rewa Group of Proterozoic Vindhyan basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0023-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Rewa Group of the Vindhyan Supergroup in the Son valley begins with a thick (∼200m) dominantly shaly,shelfal succession,occurring between the Dhandraul Formation of the Kaimur Group (ﬂuvial sandstone)below and Drammondganj Formation of the Rewa Group (marginal marine sandstone)above.Such a stratigraphic disposition indicates a sharp rise in relative sea level at the onset of Rewa sedimentation,inducing a shelfal depth to the Vindhyan basin.However,a number of wedge-shaped,sandstone/conglomerate bodies (maximum thickness 23.5 m)occur at multiple stratigraphic levels within the aforesaid deeper water shale succession,which appear to be of much shallow water origin representing regressive deposits.Though these bodies do not deﬁne a single physically continuous unit,either vertically or laterally,they are still designated by a single term ‘Asan Sandstone ’in the literature.On the other hand,the encasing shelfal shales are termed as Panna and Jhiri Shales,in accordance with their occurrence below or above the so-called ‘Asan Sandstone ’.The present study reveals that in different sections spread over the Son valley,there are several discrete regressive wedges occurring vertically,and their depositional environment is also variable,ranging between braided ﬂuvial,shoreface fan and braid delta.The  features common to most of the regressive coarser clastic bodies are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>invariable presence of deeper water,shelfal shale below (Panna or Jhiri);</li>
						<li>the underlying shale at places shows signatures of emergence at the top;</li>
						<li>laterally impersistent,wedge-like geometry;and</li>
						<li>presence of granular transgressive lags at the top.These coarser clastic wedges record several episodes of regressive deposition during short-term falling stage or lowstand of relative sea level at the early phase of Rewa sedimentation.Each individual phase of regressive deposition was, however,followed by ﬂooding and resumption of shelf mud deposition.</li>

				<abstract>
					<p>Four organic-rich shale units of the Proterozoic Vindhyan sedimentary succession have been scanned to reveal their origin and hydrocarbon potential.The wavy-crinkly nature of the carbonaceous laminae is suggestive of a microbial mat origin of the shales.These shales are thus different from Phanerozoic black shales which typically exhibit planar laminae.The hydrocarbon potential of the black shale units has been evaluated by Rock-Eval pyrolysis.Total organic carbon content of many of the shales exceeds 1%.The mean 𝑇_max for the black shales translate to a vitrinite re ﬂectance range of 2.05 –2.40%Rm based on standard conversion techniques.These shales have reached the catagenetic stage near the beginning of anthracite formation.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0049-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper addresses macroscopic signatures of microbial mat-related structures within the 1.6 Ga-old Chorhat Sandstone of the Semri Group –the basal stratigraphic unit of the Vindhyan succession in Son valley.The Chorhat Sandstone broadly represents a prograding succession of three depositional facies ranging from shallow shelf to coastal margin with aeolian sandsheet.The mat-mediated structures were generated because of plastic or brittle deformation of sand,turned cohesive and even thixotropic because of microbial mat growth.Mat growth also favoured abundant preservation of structures that usually have low preservation potential.</p>
					<p>Proliﬁc growth of microbial mat in the subtidal to intertidal zone of the Chorhat sea was facilitated due to lack of grazing and burrowing activities of organisms in the Precambrian.It further indicates low rate of sedimentation between the storms,as also attested by frequent superposition of storm-beds,even near the storm wave base.It also reduces erosion and that,in turn,would imply low sediment concentration in ﬂows leading to development of bedforms that are likely to be smaller in size and isolated from each other in a single train in contrast to those that form in mat-free sands.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mesoproterozoic (∼1600 Ma old) Salkhan Limestone (Semri Group)of the Vindhyan Supergroup, exposed in Rohtas district of Bihar,India,preserves an abundant and varied ancient microbial assemblage.These microfossils are recorded in three distinctly occurring cherts viz.,bedded chert, stromatolitic chert and cherty stromatolites.27 morphoforms belonging to 14 genera and 21 species have been recognized.Six unnamed forms are also described.</p>
					<p>The microbial assemblage,almost exclusively composed of the remnants of cyanobacteria,is dominated by entophysalidacean members and short trichomes and can be termed as ‘typical Meso-proterozoic microbiotas ’.The assemblage includes characteristic mat-forming scytonematacean and entophysalidacean cyanobacteria. <i>Eoentophysalis</i> is the dominant organism in the assemblage. Ellipsoidal akinetes of nostocalean cyanobacteria <i>(Archaeollipsoides)</i> and spherical unicells also occur;both are distinct from mat forming assemblage,allochthonous and possibly planktic.Co-occurrence of the microbiotas and precipitates is related to the depositional environment of the Mesoproterozoic tidal ﬂats with high carbonate saturation.</p>

				<title>Carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of the carbonate facies in the Vindhyan Supergroup, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0113-0134</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Vindhyan sedimentary succession in central India spans a wide time bracket from the Paleopro- terozoic to the Neoproterozoic period.Chronostratigraphic signiﬁcance of stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of the carbonate phase in Vindhyan sediments has been discussed in some recent studies.However,the subtle controls of facies variation,depositional setting and post-depositional diagenesis on stable isotope compositions are not yet clearly understood.The Vindhyan Super- group hosts four carbonate units,exhibiting a wide variability in depositional processes and paleogeography.A detailed facies-speciﬁc carbon and oxygen isotope study of the carbonate units was undertaken by us to investigate the effect of these processes and to identify the least altered isotope values.It is seen that both carbon and oxygen isotope compositions have been affected by early meteoric water diagenesis.The effect of diagenetic alteration is,however,more pronounced in case of oxygen isotopes than carbon isotopes.Stable isotope compositions remained insensitive to facies only when sediments accumulated in a shallow shelf setting without being exposed.Major alteration of original isotope ratios was observed in case of shallow marine carbonates,which became exposed to meteoric ﬂuids during early diagenetic stage.Duration of exposure possibly determined the magnitude of alteration and shift from the original values.Moreover,dolomitization is found to be accompanied by appreciable alteration of isotope compositions in some of the carbonates.The present study suggests that variations in sediment depositional settings,in particular the possibility of subaerial exposure,need to be considered while extracting chronostratigraphic signi ﬁcance from 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents results of high-resolution deep seismic reﬂection proﬁling of the Proterozoic Vindhyan basin of the Rajasthan area along the Chandli –Bundi –Kota –Kunjer pro ﬁle.Seismic images have been used to estimate the thickness of Vindhyan strata as well as to understand the tectonic framework of the basin.The results are constrained by gravity,magnetic and magne-totelluric data.The study reveals gentle SE-dipping reﬂection bands representing the Vindhyan strata.The seismic sections depict gradual thickening of the Vindhyan succession towards south-east from Bundi.The velocities of the upper and lower Vindhyans are identiﬁed as 4.6 –4.8 km/s and 5.1 –5.3 km/s.The NW limit of the Vindhyan basin is demarcated by the Great Boundary Fault (GBF)that manifests as a 30 km wide NW dipping thrust fault extending to a depth of 30 km.</p>

				<title>Age of the Vindhyan Supergroup: A review of recent findings</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0149-0160</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Vindhyan Supergroup of India is one of the largest and thickest sedimentary successions of the world.Deposited in an intra-cratonic basin,it is composed mostly of shallow marine deposits. It is believed to have recorded a substantial portion of Proterozoic time and therefore,likely to contain valuable information on the evolution of the atmosphere,climate,and life on our planet. It also contains some of the most disputed fossils of earliest animal life.Despite their importance, the absolute age of these rocks had remained unknown until recently.In this work I evaluate all the recent chronological information and discuss their implications.From the present ﬁndings it appears that the issues surrounding the age of the Lower Vindhyans in the Son valley are now resolved,whereas problems with the age of the Upper Vindhyans and that with the stratigraphic correlations remain to be answered.</p>

				<title>Mesoproterozoic diamondiferous ultramafic pipes at Majhgawan and Hinota, Panna area, central India: Key to the nature of sub-continental lithospheric mantle beneath the Vindhyan basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0161-0183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amongst all the perceptible igneous manifestations (volcanic tuffs and agglomerates,minor rhyolitic ﬂows and andesites,dolerite dykes and sills near the basin margins,etc.)in the Vindhyan basin,the two Mesoproterozoic diamondiferous ultramaﬁc pipes intruding the Kaimur Group of sediments at Majhgawan and Hinota in the Panna area are not only the most conspicuous but also well-known and have relatively deeper mantle origin.Hence,these pipes constitute the only yet available ‘direct ’mantle samples from this region and their petrology,geochemistry and iso-tope systematics are of profound signiﬁcance in understanding the nature of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle beneath the Vindhyan basin.Their emplacement age (∼1100 Ma)also constitutes the only reliable minimum age constrain on the Lower Vindhyan Group of rocks.The Majhgawan and Hinota pipes share the petrological,geochemical and isotope characteristics of kimberlite,orangeite (Group II kimberlite)and lamproite and hence are recognised as belonging to a ‘transitional kimberlite –orangeite –lamproite ’rock type.The name <i>majhagwanite</i> has been proposed by this author to distinguish them from other primary diamond source rocks.The parent magma of the Majhgawan and Hinota pipes is envisaged to have been derived by very small (&gt; 1%)degrees of partial melting of a phlogopite-garnet lherzolite source (rich in titanium and barium)that has been previously subjected to an episode of initial depletion (extensive melting during continent formation)and subsequent metasomatism (enrichment).There is absence of any subduction-related characteristics,such as large negative anomalies at Ta and Nb,and therefore, the source enrichment (metasomatism)of both these pipes is attributed to the volatile-and K-rich, extremely low-viscosity melts that leak continuously to semi-continuously from the asthenosphere and accumulate in the overlying lithosphere.Lithospheric/crustal extension,rather than decompression melting induced by a mantle plume,is favoured as the cause of melting of the source regions of Majhgawan and Hinota pipes.This paper is a review of the critical evaluation of the published work on these pipes based on contemporary knowledge derived from similar occurrences elsewhere.</p>

				<title>Transitions in the surface energy balance during the life cycle of a monsoon season</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0185-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this observational/diagnostic study,we illustrate the time history of some important parameters of the surface energy balance during the life cycle of a single monsoon season.This chronology of the surface energy balance portrays the differential equilibrium state from the preonset phase to the withdrawal phase.This includes an analysis of the time history of base variables such as soil moisture,ground temperature,cloud cover,precipitation and humidity.This is followed by an analysis of the components of the surface energy balance where we note subtle changes in the overall balances as we proceed from one epoch of the monsoon to the next.Of interest here is the transition sequence:preonset,onset,break,revival,break,revival and withdrawal during the year 2001.Computations are all illustrated for a box over central India where the coastal effects were small,data coverage was not sparse and where the semi-arid land mass changes drastically to a lush green area.This region exhibited large changes in the components of surface energy balance.The principal results pertain to what balances the difference among the incoming short wave radiation (at the earth ’s surface)and the long wave radiation exhibited by the ground.That difference is balanced by a dominant sensible heat ﬂux and the reﬂected short wave radiation in the preonset stage.A sudden change in the Bowen ratio going from &lt; 1to &gt; 1 is noted soon after the onset of monsoon.Thereafter the latent heat ﬂux from the land surface takes an important role and the sensible heat ﬂux acquires a diminishing role.We also examine the subtle changes that occur in the components of surface energy balance between the break and the active phases.The break phases are seen to be quite different from the preonset phases.This study is aimed to illustrate the major importance of moisture and clouds in the radiative transfer computations that are central to the surface energy balance during each epoch.These sensitivities (of moisture and clouds)have major consequences for weather and climate forecasts.</p>

				<title>Spatio-temporal variability of summer monsoon rainfall over Orissa in relation to low pressure systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0203-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The summer monsoon rainfall over Orissa occurs mostly due to low pressure systems (LPS)developing over the Bay of Bengal and moving along the monsoon trough.A study is hence undertaken to ﬁnd out characteristic features of the relationship between LPS over different regions and rainfall over Orissa during the summer monsoon season (June-September).For this purpose,rainfall and rainy days over 31 selected stations in Orissa and LPS days over Orissa and adjoining land and sea regions during different monsoon months and the season as a whole over a period of 20 years (1980-1999)are analysed.The principal objective of this study is to ﬁnd out the role of LPS on spatial and temporal variability of summer monsoon rainfall over Orissa.</p>
					<p>The rainfall has been signiﬁcantly less than normal over most parts of Orissa except the eastern side of Eastern Ghats during July and hence during the season as a whole due to a signiﬁcantly less number of LPS days over northwest Bay in July over the period of 1980-1999.The seasonal rainfall shows higher interannual variation (increase in coefficient of variation by about 5%)during 1980-1999 than that during 1901-1990 over most parts of Orissa except northeast Orissa.Most parts of Orissa,especially the region extending from central part of coastal Orissa to western Orissa (central zone)and western side of the Eastern Ghats get more seasonal monsoon rainfall with the development and persistence of LPS over northwest Bay and their subsequent movement and persistence over Orissa.The north Orissa adjoining central zone also gets more seasonal rainfall with development and persistence of LPS over northwest Bay.While the seasonal rainfall over the western side of the Eastern Ghats is adversely affected due to increase in LPS days over west central Bay,Jharkhand and Bangladesh,that over the eastern side of the Eastern Ghats is adversely affected due to increase in LPS days over all the regions to the north of Orissa.There are signiﬁcant decreasing trends in rainfall and number of rainy days over some parts of southwest Orissa during June and decreasing trends in rainy days over some parts of north interior Orissa and central part of coastal Orissa during July over the period of 1980-1999.</p>

				<title>Coupled equations for transient water flow, heat flow, and deformation in hydrogeological systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0219-0228</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrogeological systems are earth systems inﬂuenced by water.Their behaviors are governed by interacting processes,including ﬂow of ﬂuids,deformation of porous materials,chemical reactions, and transport of matter and energy.Here,coupling among three of these processes is considered: ﬂow of water,heat,and deformation,each of which is represented by a diffusion-type of partial differential equation.One side of the diffusion-type equation relates to motion of matter or energy, while the other relates to temporal changes of state variables at a given location.The coupling arises from processes that govern motion as well as those that relate to change of state.In this work, attention is devoted to coupling arising from changes in state.Partial derivatives of equations of state constitute the capacitance terms of diffusion-type equations.Of the many partial derivatives that are mathematically possible in physical systems characterized by several variables,only a few are physically signi ﬁcant.Because the state variables are related to each other through an equation of state,the partial derivatives must collectively satisfy a closure criterion.This framework offers a systematic way of developing the coupled set of equations that govern hydrogeological systems involving the ﬂow of water,heat,and deformation.Such systems are described in terms of four variables,and the associated partial derivatives.The physical import of these derivatives are discussed,followed by a description of partial derivatives that are of practical interest.These partial derivatives are then used as the basis to develop a set of coupled equations.A brief discussion is presented on coupled equations from a perspective of energy optimization.</p>

				<title>Impact of sea breeze on wind-seas off Goa, west coast of India</title>

				<page>0229-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>After withdrawal of the Indian Summer Monsoon and until onset of the next monsoon,i.e.,roughly during November-May,winds in the coastal regions of India are dominated by sea breeze.It has an impact on the daily cycle of the sea state near the coast.The impact is quite signiﬁcant when large scale winds are weak.During one such event,1 –15 April 1997,a Datawell directional waverider buoy was deployed in 23 m water depth off Goa,west coast of India.Twenty-minute averaged spectra,collected once every three hours,show that the spectrum of sea-breeze-related ‘wind-seas ’ peaked at 0.23 ± 0.05 Hz. These wind-seas were well separated from swells of frequencies less than 0.15 Hz.The TMA spectrum (Bouws <i>et al</i> 1985) matched the observed seas spectra very well when the sea-breeze was active and the fetch corresponding to equilibrium spectrum was found to be 77 ± 43 km during such occasions. We emphasize on the diurnal cycle of sea-breeze-related sea off the coast of Goa and write an equation for the energy of the seas as a function of the local wind.</p>

				<page>0239-0248</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The proper usage of modal composition and geochemical classiﬁcation of granitoids is discussed for assigning a proper nomenclature for the Angadimogar pluton,Kerala,southwestern India.This discussion is mainly aimed at addressing questions concerning the nomenclature of Angadimogar pluton (syenite vs. granite).Modal composition and whole-rock XRD data clearly show that the pluton exposed near Angadimogar is a quartz-syenite and its geochemistry is typical of a ferroan, metaluminous,alkali (A-type)granitoid.</p>

				<title>Bedrock gorges in the central mainland Kachchh: Implications for landscape evolution</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0249-0256</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kachchh possesses a fault-controlled ﬁrst-order topography and several geomorphic features indicative of active tectonics.Though coseismic neotectonic activity is believed to be the major factor in the evolution of the landscape,detailed documentation and analysis of vital landscape features like drainage characteristics,bedrock gorges and terraces are lacking.The present study is a site-speci ﬁc documentation of gorges developed in the central part of the mainland Kachchh.We analyzed and interpreted four gorges occurring on either side of Katrol Hill Fault (KHF).The Khari river gorge is endowed with six levels of bedrock terraces,some of which are studded with large potholes and ﬂutings.Since no active development of potholes is observed along the rivers in the present day hyper-arid conditions,we infer an obvious linkage of gorges to the humid phases,which provided high energy runoff for the formation of gorges and distinct bedrock terraces and associated erosional features.Development of gorges within the miliolites and incision in the ﬂuvial deposits to the south of the KHF indicates that the gorges were formed during Early Holocene.However,ubi-quitous occurrence of gorges along the streams to the south of KHF,the uniformly N40&#176;E trend of the gorges,their close association with transverse faults and the short length of the exceptionally well developed Khari river gorge in the low-relief rocky plain to the north of KHF suggests an important role of neotectonic movements.</p>

				<title>Fast computation of Hankel Transform using orthonormal exponential approximation of complex kernel function</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0267-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The computation of electromagnetic (EM)ﬁelds,for 1-D layered earth model,requires evaluation of Hankel Transform (HT)of the EM kernel function.The digital ﬁltering is the most widely used technique to evaluate HT integrals.However,it has some obvious shortcomings.We present an alternative scheme,based on an orthonormal exponential approximation of the kernel function, for evaluating HT integrals.This approximation of the kernel function was chosen because the analytical solution of HT of an exponential function is readily available in literature.This expansion reduces the integral to a simple algebraic sum.The implementation of such a scheme requires that the weights and the exponents of the exponential function be estimated.The exponents were estimated through a guided search algorithm while the weights were obtained using Marquardt matrix inversion method.The algorithm was tested on analytical HT pairs available in literature. The results are compared with those obtained using the digital ﬁltering technique with Anderson ﬁlters.The ﬁeld curves for four types (A-,K-,H-and Q-type)of 3-layer earth models are generated using the present scheme and compared with the corresponding curves obtained using the Anderson scheme.It is concluded that the present scheme is more accurate than the Anderson scheme.</p>

				<title>Modeling of groundwater flow for Mujib aquifer, Jordan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0289-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Jordan is an arid country with very limited water resources.Groundwater is the main source for its water supply.Mujib aquifer is located in the central part of Jordan and is a major source of drinking water for Amman,Madaba and Karak cities.High abstraction rates from Mujib aquifer during the previous years lead to a major decline in water levels and deterioration in groundwater quality. Therefore,proper groundwater management of Mujib aquifer is necessary;and groundwater ﬂow modeling is essential for proper management.For this purpose,Mod ﬂow was used to build a groundwater ﬂow model to simulate the behavior of the ﬂow system under different stresses.The model was calibrated for steady state condition by matching observed and simulated initial head counter lines.Drawdown data for the period 1985-1995 were used to calibrate the transient model by matching simulated drawdown with the observed one.Then,the transient model was validated by using drawdown data for the period 1996-2002.The results of the calibrated model showed that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the B2/A7 aquifer ranges between 0.001 and 40 m/d. Calibrated speci ﬁc yield ranges from 0.0001 to 0.15.The water balance for the steady state condition of Mujib aquifer indicated that the total annual direct recharge is 20.4 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, the total annual in ﬂow is 13.0 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, springs discharge is 15.3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, and total annual out ﬂow is 18.7 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. Different scenarios were considered to predict aquifer system response under different conditions.  The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the model is highly sensitive to horizontal hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy and with lower level to the recharge rates.Also the model is sensitive to speciﬁc yield.</p>

				<title>Simulation of a Himalayan cloudburst event</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0299-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intense rainfall often leads to ﬂoods and landslides in the Himalayan region even with rainfall amounts that are considered comparatively moderate over the plains;for example,‘cloudbursts ’, which are devastating convective phenomena producing sudden high-intensity rainfall (∼10 cm per hour)over a small area.Early prediction and warning of such severe local weather systems is crucial to mitigate societal impact arising from the accompanying ﬂash ﬂoods.We examine a cloudburst event in the Himalayan region at Shillagarh village in the early hours of 16 July 2003.The storm lasted for less than half an hour, followed by ﬂash ﬂoods that affected hundreds of people.We examine the ﬁdelity of MM5 con ﬁgured with multiple-nested domains (81,27,9 and 3 km grid-resolution)for predicting a cloudburst event with attention to horizontal resolution and the cloud microphysics parameterization.The MM5 model predicts the rainfall amount 24 hours in advance. However,the location of the cloudburst is displaced by tens of kilometers.</p>

				<title>Operational mesoscale atmospheric dispersion prediction using a parallel computing cluster</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0315-0332</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An operational atmospheric dispersion prediction system is implemented on a cluster supercomputer for Online Emergency Response at the Kalpakkam nuclear site.This numerical system constitutes a parallel version of a nested grid meso-scale meteorological model MM5 coupled to a random walk particle dispersion model FLEXPART.The system provides 48-hour forecast of the local weather and radioactive plume dispersion due to hypothetical airborne releases in a range of 100 km around the site.The parallel code was implemented on different cluster con ﬁgurations like distributed and shared memory systems.A 16-node dual Xeon distributed memory gigabit ethernet cluster has been found sufficient for operational applications.The runtime of a triple nested domain MM5 is about 4 h for a 24 h forecast.The system had been operated continuously for a few months and results were ported on the IMSc home page.</p>
					<p>Initial and periodic boundary condition data for MM5 are provided by NCMRWF,New Delhi. An alternative source is found to be NCEP,USA.These two sources provide the input data to the operational models at different spatial and temporal resolutions using different assimilation methods.A comparative study on the results of forecast is presented using these two data sources for present operational use.Improvement is noticed in rainfall forecasts that used NCEP data, probably because of its high spatial and temporal resolution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Daily zenith scattered light intensity observations were carried out in the morning twilight hours using home-made UV-visible spectrometer over the tropical station Pune (18&#176; 31&#8242;, 73&#176; 51&#8242;)for the years 2000-2003.These observations are obtained in the spectral range 462-498 nm for the solar zenith angles (SZAs)varying from 87&#176; to 91.5&#176;. An algorithm has been developed to retrieve vertical proﬁles of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) from ground-based measurements using the Chahine iteration method.This retrieval method has been checked using measured and recalculated slant column densities (SCDs)and they are found to be well matching. O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> vertical proﬁles have been retrieved using a set of their air mass factors (AMFs)and SCDs measured over a range of 87-91.5&#176; SZA during the morning.The vertical proﬁles obtained by this method are compared with Umkehr proﬁles and ozonesondes and they are found to be in good agreement.The bulk of the column density is found near layer 20-25 km.Daily total column densities (TCDs)of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> along with their stratospheric and tropospheric counterparts are derived using their vertical proﬁles for the period 2000-2003.The total column,stratospheric column and tropospheric column amounts of both trace gases are found to be maximum in summer and minimum in the winter season.Increasing trend is found in column density of NO<sub>2</sub> in stratospheric,tropospheric and surface layers,but no trend is observed in O<sub>3</sub> columns for above layers during the period 2000-2003.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The local and teleconnective association between Northeast Monsoon Rainfall (NEMR)over Tamil Nadu and global Surface Temperature Anomalies (STA)is examined using the monthly grid-ded STA data for the period 1901-2004.Various geographical regions which have signiﬁcant tele-connective signals associated with NEMR are identi ﬁed.During excess (deﬁcient)NEMR years,it is observed that the meridional gradient in surface air temperature anomalies between Europe and north Africa,in the month of September is directed from the subtropics (higher latitudes)to higher latitudes (subtropics).It is also observed that North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)during September in ﬂuences the surface air temperature distribution over north Africa and Europe.Also,the NAO index in January shows signiﬁcant inverse relationship with NEMR since recent times.The central and eastern equatorial Paciﬁc oceanic regions have signi ﬁcant and consistent positive correlation with NEMR while the western equatorial region has signiﬁcant negative correlation with NEMR. A zonal temperature anomaly gradient index (ZTAGI)de ﬁned between eastern equatorial Paciﬁc and western equatorial Paciﬁc shows stable signiﬁcant inverse relationship with NEMR.</p>

				<title>Amino sugars in suspended particulate matter from the Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon of 2001</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0363-0370</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Amino sugars (AS)are important constituents of organic matter.However,very little is known about their cycling in marine waters.In this research,we assessed the distribution and cycling of these compounds in waters of the Bay of Bengal.For this purpose,samples of suspended particulate matter (SPM)were collected from 8 depths (surface to 1000 m)at 6 locations during the 166th cruise of the ORV Sagar Kanya in the Bay of Bengal in July/August 2001.The SPM samples were analysed for particulate organic carbon (POC),particulate nitrogen (PN)and AS concentrations and composition.The AS varied between 0.4 and 17.5 nmol/l.Concentrations were high in the surface waters and generally decreased with increasing depth.AS concentration decreased from the south to north.AS accounted for 0.01 to 0.71%and 0.05 to 2.37%of POC and PN,respectively. Rapid decrease in AS-C%and AS-N%with depth indicates that these compounds were preferentially degraded relative to bulk POC and PN.The composition of AS suggests that glucosamine (GLU-N)and galactosamine (GAL-N)were present in the surface SPM samples,and their abundance decreased from surface downwards.Relatively,low values of GLU-N/GAL-N ratio indicate that the organic matter was mostly derived from the detritus of micro-organisms.Our data suggest that chitin,a polymer of the glucosamine produced by many marine organisms was not the major source of AS in the Bay.Rapid cycling of these compounds indicates their importance in the cycling of nitrogen in marine waters.</p>

					<p>On 26th December 2004,the world witnessed the devastating power of tsunami, affecting many countries,bordering the Indian Ocean region.This has caused signiﬁcant changes in the shallow and intertidal regions of the Indian coast,especially the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry.The baseline data on biomass availability and distribution of benthic intertidal seaweed species were collected immediately after this catastrophic event by spot surveying 11 selected localities of the above-mentioned regions.In all,45 species belonging to 31 genera were recorded during the present survey,the maximum number of seaweed species were recorded at Thirumullavarum,Kerala with the minimum at Car Nicobar,Andaman and Nicobar Islands. A very different trend was observed in the case of biomass availability at some locations which was due to the inﬂuence of habitat suitability over the tsunami damage.The details of this study have been provided in the present communication.</p>

				<title>Climate induced changes in the circulation and dispersal patterns of the fluvial sources during late Quaternary in the middle Bengal Fan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0379-0386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>From a transact along <sup>15</sup>&#176; N latitude in the middle Bengal Fan, temporal and spatial variations in the granulometric parameters and clay minerals in <sup>14</sup>C dated box cores from the eastern, the central and the western regions were studied to determine climate induced changes in the hydrography. Clay assemblages have spatial and temporal changes and are markedly different in the eastern and the western bay. From a high abundance of the clay smectite, which has its major source in the Deccan Basalt in peninsular India, it is inferred that the western bay is predominantly a depocenter of ‘peninsular sources’. The eastern and the central regions of the bay, however, mostly receive sediments of the ‘Himalayan source’. Related to unstable climate, the reported dominant illite–chlorite (I + C) assemblage in the eastern region of the bay (I + C &gt; 60% smectite &lt; 15%), between 18 and 12.6 ka BP, points to a predominant supply from the Himalayan sources through equatorwards dispersal by the winter hydrography. Higher smectite, and reduced clays of the Himalayan sources (smectite &gt; 25%; I + C &gt; 45%)are reported also after 12.5 ka BP from the eastern bay. These are interpreted as evidences of an intensiﬁed SW monsoon and associated change in the dispersal pattern by stronger summer monsoon hydrography which supports across bay dispersal by anticyclonic gyre. The inﬂuence of climate on hydrographic changes is consistent during the short events of arid climate (weak NE monsoon) in Holocene in core 31/1(western bay), in which the enhanced contents of the clays of the Himalayan sources are observed (smectite &lt; 40% I + C &gt; 50%). These ﬁndings have implications for climate regulated in ﬂuence of ﬂuvial processes over the areas, hitherto, considered unaffected by the Indian peninsular ﬂuvial sources.</p>

				<title>Structure of Charnockitic basement in a part of the Krishna–Godavari basin, Andhra Pradesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0387-0393</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A regional magnetic survey was carried out over an area of 8000 km<sup>2</sup> in Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh,India,which is covered by the rocks of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) <i>viz.,</i> the Khondalitic series and Charnockites in the northern half and Permian to Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments in the southern half,and forms a part of the Krishna –Godavari (K –G)basin. The survey brought out a strong NE –SW trending anomaly in the area covered by the rocks of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB),and a mild ENE –WSW trending anomaly in the area covered by the sediments of the Krishna –Godavari (K –G)basin.The NE –SW trending anomaly in the northern half could be attributed to the exposed/near surface Charnockite basement that has come closer to the surface as a result of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt  (EGMB)tectonics.Explanation of  the mild ENE –WSW trending anomaly over the sediments of the Krishna –Godavari (K –G)basin required a faulted magnetic basement at depth downthrown towards the south.It is therefore concluded that the Charnockitic basement together with the Khondalite group of rocks which are folded and faulted during the different phases of tectonics of Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) extend into the Krishna –Godavari (K –G)basin and further,were involved in faulting during the phases of formation and sedimentation in the Krishna –Godavari (K –G)basin.</p>

				<title>Geomorphic expression of late Quaternary sea level changes along the southern Saurashtra coast, western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0395-0402</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geomorphic expression of land-sea interaction is preserved in the form of abandoned cliffs, marine terraces,shore platforms and marine notches along the southern Saurashtra coast. These features have been used to ascertain the magnitude of sea level changes during late Quaternary.Notch morphology and associated biological encrustation have been used to estimate the magnitude and duration of palaeo-sea strands.Marine notches and other erosive features occurring between 12 and 15 m above the present Biological Mean Sea Level (BMSL) are attributed to the last interglacial corresponding to the Marine Isotopic Stage 5 (MIS-5). However,6 to 9 m upliftment of the coastal fringe is attributed to this sea level.The second major high sea strand was identiﬁed during the mid-Holocene when the sea rose 2 m above the present level.Notches corresponding to this high sea level are recorded 4 to 5 m above the present BMSL.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface seawater samples were collected over a period of 27 months at a shallow water station in Dona Paula bay from 1998-2000.The samples were analyzed to assess the seasonal variations, inter-annual variability and the contributions of:</p>

					<p>A distinct inter-annual variability was observed with an increase in the bacterial abundance,chlorophyll 𝑎 (Chl 𝑎 ,TEP and Sal-PCHO and their greater contribution to particulate organic carbon during May 1998-1999 than in June 1999-July 2000.Overall,there was no statistically signiﬁcant correlation of TEP with phytoplankton biomass (Chl 𝑎 ,Sal-PCHO,CPCHO and hydrodynamic conditions.A weak inverse correlation was observed between TEP and TBA (𝑟 = −0.397; 𝑝 &gt; 0.05) but the role of TEP as a C-source for bacteria was not evident.Both Sal-PCHO and CPCHO appeared to be two distinct forms of carbohydrates.Unlike CPCHO,Sal-PCHO concentrations showed a positive trend with Chl 𝑎 and signiﬁcant linear correlation with bacterial abundance (𝑟 =0.44, 𝑝 &gt; 0.007, 𝑛= 48),indicating that Sal-PCHO as carbon source might have supported bacterioplankton abundance.The mean %TEP-C contribution to the annual average organic carbon for 1998-2000 was 6.9% ± 5.8%, next only to phytoplankton-C (33.1 ± 22.1%) and greater than bacterial-C (4.6% ± 4.6%)or carbohydrate-C (&gt; 3.8%).Despite its greater contribution to the organic carbon pool,the contribution of TEP-C to the benthic carbon demand and its fate in the study area could not be ascertained in this study.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sediment trap samples collected from a depth of 1018 m in the Central Arabian Sea Trap (CAST) at 14&#176; 28.2&#8242;N, 64&#176; 35.8&#8242;E were analyzed for temporal variation of coccolithophore ﬂuxes from October 1993 to August 1994.Out of the twenty species of coccolithophores encountered, \tetit {Gephyrocapsa oceanica,Emiliania huxleyi,Umbilicosphaera sibogae} and <i>Umbellosphaera irregularis</i> were the most abundant.The total coccolithophore ﬂuxes ranged from 28.5 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> to 50.3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> showing seasonality with higher ﬂuxes during the northeast (NE) monsoon and lower ﬂuxes during the spring intermonsoon. The higher ﬂuxes were attributed to the enhancement of primary production in the central Arabian Sea due to southward extent of nutrients from the northeast Arabian Sea by the prevailing surface currents. Similarly, the occurrences of relatively lower coc-colithophore ﬂuxes during the spring intermonsoon and southwest (SW) monsoon were attributed to the low nutrients in the warm, shallow surface mixed layer and downwelling to the south of Findlater Jet respectively in the central Arabian Sea.Some of the coccolithophore species such as <i>E.huxleyi, G.oceanica, Calcidiscus leptoporus</i> and <i>Umbellosphaera tenuis</i> showed signs of dissolution.</p>

					<p>Data on ocean color chlorophyll 𝑎 (Chl 𝑎 )obtained using Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS),sea surface temperature (SST)by Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR),and sea surface height (SSH)by TOPEX/POSEIDON were analyzed to examine the inﬂuence of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)on the physical and biogeochemical processes with special reference to phytoplankton primary production and air –sea ﬂuxes of carbon dioxide in the Arabian Sea.Positive SST anomalies (SSTA)were found in the Arabian Sea (0.4 to 1.8&#176;C) with higher values in the southwestern Arabian Sea that decreased towards north.The SSH anomalies (SSHA)and turbulent kinetic energy anomalies (TKEA)suggest decreased mixing during the IOD compared to the normal period.Chlorophyll 𝑎 displayed signiﬁcant negative correlations with SSTA and SSHA in the Arabian Sea.Consistently, Chl 𝑎 showed negative anomalies (low Chl 𝑎 )during the IOD period which could be due to reduced inputs of nutrients.The photic zone integrated primary production decreased by 30%during the IOD period compared to the normal whereas pCO<sub>2</sub> levels were higher (by 10-20 𝜇 atm). However,sea to air ﬂuxes were lower by 10% during the IOD period due to prevailing weaker winds.Primary production seems to be the key process controlling the surface pCO<sub>2</sub> levels in the Arabian Sea.In future,the in ﬂuence of IOD on ecosystem structure,export production and bacterial respiration rates are to be probed through <i>in situ</i> time-series observations.</p>

				<feature>Special Section on: Material exchanges at marine boundaries and surface ocean processes: Forcings and feedbacks</feature>
				<page>0451-0460</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sedimentary methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) ﬂuxes and oxidation rates were determined over the wet and dry seasons (four measurement campaigns)in Pulicat lake,an extensive shallow estuary in south India. Dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were measured at 52 locations in December 2000.The annual mean net CH<sub>4</sub> ﬂux from Pulicat lake sediments was 3.7 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup> g yr<sup>−1</sup> based on static chamber measurements. A further 1.7 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup> g yr<sup>−1</sup> was estimated to be oxidized at the sediment-water interface. The mean dissolved concentration of CH<sub>4</sub> was 242 nmol l<sup>−1</sup> (ranging between 94 and 501 nmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and the spatial distribution could be explained by tidal dynamics and freshwater input.Sea –air exchange estimates using models, account only for ∼13%(0.5 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup> g yr<sup>−1</sup>) of the total CH<sub>4</sub> produced in sediments, whereas ebullition appeared to be the major route for loss to the atmosphere (∼63% of the net sediment ﬂux).We estimated the total atmospheric source of CH<sub>4</sub> from Pulicat lake to be 0.5 to 4.0 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup> g yr<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

				<page>0461-0472</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Particulate ﬂuxes of aluminium,iron,magnesium and titanium were measured using six time-series sediment traps deployed in the eastern, central and western Arabian Sea. Annual Al ﬂuxes at shallow and deep trap depths were 0.47 and 0.46 gm<sup>−2</sup> in the western Arabian Sea,and 0.33 and 0.47 g m<sup>−2</sup> in the eastern Arabian Sea. There is a difference of about 0.9-1.8gm<sup>−2</sup> y<sup>−1</sup> in the lithogenic ﬂuxes determined analytically (residue remaining after leaching out all biogenic particles) and estimated from the Al ﬂuxes in the western Arabian Sea. This arises due to higher ﬂuxes of Mg (as dolomite) in the western Arabian Sea (6-11 times higher than the eastern Arabian Sea). The estimated dolomite ﬂuxes at the western Arabian Sea site range from 0.9 to 1.35gm<sup>−2</sup> y<sup>−1</sup>. Fe ﬂuxes in the Arabian Sea were less than that of the reported atmospheric ﬂuxes without any evidence for the presence of labile fraction/excess of Fe in the settling particles. More than 75% of Al, Fe, Ti and Mg ﬂuxes occurred during the southwest (SW) monsoon in the western Arabian Sea. In the eastern Arabian Sea, peak Al, Fe, Mg and Ti ﬂuxes were recorded during both the northeast (NE) and SW monsoons. During the SW monsoon, there exists a time lag of around one month between the increases in lithogenic and dolomite ﬂuxes. Total lithogenic ﬂuxes increase when the southern branch of dust bearing northwesterlies is dragged by the SW monsoon winds to the trap locations. However, the dolomite ﬂuxes increase only when the northern branch of the northwesterlies (which carries a huge amount of dolomite accounting 60% of the total dust load) is dragged, from further north, by SW monsoon winds. The potential for the use of Mg/Fe ratio as a paleo-monsoonal proxy is examined.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Characteristics of trace gases (O<sub>3</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O and aerosols (particle size of 2.5 micron) were studied over the Arabian Sea,equatorial Indian Ocean and southwest part of the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon transition period (October-November,2004).Flow of pollutants is expected from south and southeast Asia during the monsoonal transition period due to the patterns of wind ﬂow which are different from the monsoon period.This is the ﬁrst detailed report on aerosols and trace gases during the sampled period as the earlier Bay of Bengal Experiment (BOBMEX), Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX)and Indian Ocean Experiments (INDOEX)were during monsoon seasons. The signiﬁcant observations during the transition period include: (i) low ozone concentration of the order of 5 ppbv around the equator,(ii)high concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O and (iii)variations in PM2.5 of 5-20 𝜇 g/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>

				<title>Discriminating four tectonic settings: Five new geochemical diagrams for basic and ultrabasic volcanic rocks based on log–ratio transformation of major-element data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0485-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present ﬁve new discriminant function diagrams based on an extensive database representative of basic and ultrabasic rocks from four tectonic settings of island arc, continental rift, ocean-island, and mid-ocean ridge. These diagrams were obtained after log_{e}-transformation of concentration ratios of major-elements – a technique recommended for a correct statistical treatment of compositional data. Higher % success rates (overall values from ∼83 to 97%) were obtained for proposing these new diagrams as compared to those (∼82 to 94%) obtained from the discriminant analysis of the raw major-element concentration data (i.e., without the log_{e}-transformation and without taking ratios of the compositional data, but using exactly the same database to provide an unbiased comparison), suggesting that such a data transformation constitutes a statistically correct and recommended technique. The new diagrams also resulted in less mis-classiﬁcation of basic and ultrabasic rocks from known tectonic settings than the diagrams obtained from the raw data. The use of these highly successful new discriminant function diagrams is illustrated using Miocene to Recent basic and ultrabasic rocks from three areas of Mexico with complex or controversial tectonic settings (Mexican Volcanic Belt, Los Tuxtlas volcanic ﬁeld, and Eastern Alkaline Province), as well as older rocks from three areas (Deccan, Malani, and Bastar) of India. Additionally, the major-element data from two ‘known’ continental arc settings are used to show that they are similar to those from the island arc setting. Continental rift setting is inferred for all Mexican cases and for one cratonic area of India (Malani) and an IAB setting for the Bastar craton. The Deccan ﬂood basalt province of India is used to warn against an indiscriminate use of those discrimination diagrams that do not explicitly include the likely setting of the area under evaluation. An Excel template is also provided for an easy application of these new diagrams for discriminating the four settings considered in this work.</p>

				<title>High resolution numerical weather prediction over the Indian subcontinent</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0529-0555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the Florida State University Global Spectral Model (FSUGSM), in association with a high-resolution nested regional spectral model (FSUNRSM), is used for short-range weather forecasts over the Indian domain. Three-day forecasts for each day of August 1998 were performed using different versions of the FSUGSM and FSUNRSM and were compared with the observed ﬁelds (analysis) obtained from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The impact of physical initialization (a procedure that assimilates observed rain rates into the model atmosphere through a set of reverse algorithms) on rainfall forecasts was examined in detail. A very high nowcasting skill for precipitation is obtained through the use of high-resolution physical initialization applied at the regional model level. Higher skills in wind and precipitation forecasts over the Indian summer monsoon region are achieved using this version of the regional model with physical initialization.</p>
					<p>A relatively new concept, called the ‘multimodel/multianalysis superensemble’ is described in this paper and is applied for the wind and precipitation forecasts over the Indian subcontinent. Large improvement in forecast skills of wind at 850 hPa level over the Indian subcontinent is shown possible through the use of the multimodel superensemble. The multianalysis superensemble approach that uses the latest satellite data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) has shown signiﬁcant improvement in the skills of precipitation forecasts over the Indian monsoon region.</p>

				<title>A numerical study of sea breeze circulation observed at a tropical site Kalpakkam on the east coast of India, under different synoptic flow situations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0557-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A simulation study of the sea breeze circulation and thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL) characteristics has been carried out at the tropical site Kalpakkam on the east coast of India, for operational atmospheric dispersion prediction. The community based PSU/NCAR MM5 Mesoscale meteorological model is used for the study. Three cases on typical days in summer (24 May 2003), southwest (SW) monsoon (1 July 2001) winter season (2 February 2003) with different largescale  flow pattern are studied. The MM5 model is used with 3 nested domains with horizontal grid resolutions 18 km, 6 km and 2 km and 26 vertical levels. The model is integrated for 24 hours in the above cases with initial and boundary conditions taken from NCEP-FNL analyses data. Observations of 10 meteorological stations and coastal boundary layer experiments conducted at Kalpakkam are used for comparison and validation of the simulation. The characteristics of simulated sea breeze and TIBL at Kalpakkam are seen to vary in the above cases according to the prevailing large-scale winds and surface fluxes. The sea breeze circulation is seen to develop early with larger strength and inland propagation in the summer case under the influence of moderate synoptic wind and strong heating conditions than in the SW monsoon and winter cases. The horizontal and vertical extents of TIBL are found to be larger in the summer case than in other cases. Although model parameters agree in general with observations, all the fine features are not clearly captured and some slowness in model sea breeze development is also seen. The results indicate the need to improve i) the initial conditions by assimilation of available surface/upper air observations to reduce model bias and ii) surface net radiation parameterisation. The model could predict the essential features of the local circulation and further improvement is expected with better initial condition data and incorporation of more realistic surface data.</p>

				<title>Summer monsoon intraseasonal oscillation over eastern Arabian Sea – as revealed by TRMM microwave imager products</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0575-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The time evolution of atmospheric parameters on intraseasonal time scale in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) is studied during the summer monsoon seasons of 1998–2003 using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) data. This is done using the spectral and wavelet analysis. Analysis shows that over EAS, total precipitable water vapour (TWV) and sea surface wind speed (SWS) have a periodicity of 8–15 days, 15–30 days and 30–60 days during the monsoon season. Signiﬁcant power is seen in the 8–15-day time scale in TWV during onset and retreat of the summer monsoon. Analysis indicates that the timings of the intensiﬁcation of 8–15, 15–30, and 30–60 days oscillations have a profound effect on the evolution of the daily rainfall over west coast of India. The positive and negative phases of these oscillations are directly related to the active and dry spells of rainfall along the west coast of India. The spectral analysis shows interannual variation of TWV and SWS. Heavy rainfall events generally occur over the west coast of India when positive phases of both 30–60 days and 15–30 days modes of TWV and SWS are simultaneously present.</p>

				<title>Marine boundary layer characteristics during a cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0587-0599</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the period 12–16 June 1996 a tropical cyclonic storm formed over the southwest Bay of Bengal and moved in a north–northeasterly direction. The thermodynamic characteristics of this system are investigated by utilizing the surface and upper air observations collected onboard <i>ORV Sagar Kanya</i> over the Bay of Bengal region. The response of the cyclonic storm is clearly evident from the ship observations when the ship was within the distance of 600–800 km from the cyclonic storm. This study explores why (i) the whole atmosphere from surface to 500 hPa had become warm and moist during the cyclonic storm period as compared to before and after the formation of this system and (ii) the lower layer of the atmosphere had become stable during the formative stage of the cyclonic storm.</p>

				<title>Spatial monsoon variability with respect to NAO and SO</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0601-0606</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the simultaneous effect of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Southern Oscillation (SO) on monsoon rainfall over different homogeneous regions/subdivisions of India is studied.  The simultaneous effect of both NAO and SO on Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) is more important than their individual impact because both the oscillations exist simultaneously throughout the year. To represent the simultaneous impact of NAO and SO, an index called effective strength index (ESI) has been deﬁned on the basis of monthly NAO and SO indices.</p>
					<p>The variation in the tendency of ESI from January through April has been analyzed and reveals that when this tendency is decreasing, then the ESI value throughout the monsoon season (June-September) of the year remains negative and <i>vice versa</i>. This study further suggests that during the negative phase of ESI tendency, almost all subdivisions of India show above-normal rainfall and <i>vice versa</i>. The correlation analysis indicates that the ESI-tendency is showing an inverse and statistically signiﬁcant relationship with rainfall over 14 subdivisions of India. Area wise, about 50% of the total area of India shows statistically signiﬁcant association. Moreover, the ESI-tendency shows a signiﬁcant relationship with rainfall over north west India, west central India, central north east India, peninsular India and India as a whole. Thus, ESI-tendency can be used as a precursor for the prediction of Indian summer monsoon rainfall on a smaller spatial scale.</p>

					<p>The paper presents the effect of O<sub>3</sub> depletion on night airglow emission of Na 5893 A line at Dumdum (22.5&#176;N, 88.5&#176;E), India and Halley Bay (76&#176;S, 27&#176;W), a British Antarctic service station. Calculations based on chemical kinetics show that the airglow intensity of Na 5893 A line will also be affected due to the depletion of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The nature of yearly variation and seasonal variation of the intensity of Na 5893 A line for the above two stations are shown and compared. It is shown that the rate of decrease of intensity of Na 5893 A line is comparatively more at Halley Bay due to the dramatic decrease of Antarctic O<sub>3</sub> concentration. A possible explanation for this dramatic decrease of Antarctic O<sub>3</sub> concentration is also mentioned.</p>

				<title>The emplacement of pahoehoe lavas on Kilauea and in the Deccan Traps</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0615-0629</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a growing interest in deciphering the emplacement and environmental impact of ﬂood basalt provinces such as the Deccan, India. Observations of active volcanism lead to meaningful interpretations of now-extinct volcanic systems. Here, I illustrate and discuss the morphology and emplacement of the modern and active lava ﬂows of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii, and based on them, interpret the compound pahoehoe lavas of the Deccan Traps. The latter are vastly larger (areally extensive and voluminous) than Kilauea ﬂows, and yet, their internal architecture is the same as that of Kilauea ﬂows, and even the sizes of individual ﬂow units often identical. Many or most compound ﬂows of the Deccan Traps were emplaced in a gentle, effusive, Kilauea-like fashion. Bulk eruption rates for the Deccan province are unknown, and were probably high, but the local eruption rates of the compound ﬂows were no larger than Kilauea’s. Large (&#8805; 1000 km<sup>3</sup>) individual compound pahoehoe ﬂows in the Deccan could have been emplaced at Kilauea-like local eruption rates (1 m<sup>3</sup>/sec per metre length of ﬁssure) in a decade or less, given ﬁssures of sufficient length (tens of kilometres), now exposed as dyke swarms in the province.</p>

				<page>0631-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Field investigations of the Deccan Trap lava sequence along a 70 km traverse in the Narsingpur–Harrai–Amarwara area of central India indicate twenty lava ﬂows comprising a total thickness of around 480m. Primary volcanic structures like vesicles and cooling joints are conspicuous in this volcanic succession and are used to divide individual ﬂows into three well-deﬁned zones namely the lower colonnade zone, entablature zone, and the upper colonnade zone. The variable nature of these structural zones is used for identiﬁcation and correlation of lava ﬂows in the ﬁeld. For twenty lava ﬂows, the thicknesses of upper colonnade zones of eight ﬂows are ∼5m while those of eight other ﬂows are ∼8m each. The thicknesses of upper colonnade zones of remaining four ﬂows could not be measured in the ﬁeld. Using the thicknesses of these upper colonnade zones and standard temperature-ﬂow thickness-cooling time proﬁles for lava pile, the total cooling time of these sixteen Deccan Trap lava ﬂows has been estimated at 12 to 15 years.</p>

				<title>Is the outcrop topology of dolerite dikes of the Precambrian Singhbhum Craton fractal?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0643-0660</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Precambrian Singhbhum Craton of eastern India, newer dolerite dikes occur profusely with varying outcrop lengths. We have analysed the nature of their length-size and orientation distributions in relation to the theory of fractals. Two orientational sets of dikes (NW–SE and NE–SW) are present. Both the sets show strongly non-power-law size distributions, as reﬂected in nonlinear variations in logarithmic space. We analyzed thousands of data, revealing that polynomial functions with a degree of 3 to 4 are the best representatives of the non-linear variations. Orientation analysis shows that the degree of dispersions from the mean trend tends to decrease with increasing dike length. The length-size distributions were studied by simulating fractures in physical models.  Experimental fractures also show a non-power-law distribution, which grossly conforms to those of the dolerite dikes. This type of complex size distributions results from the combined effects of nucleation, propagation and coalescence of fractures.</p>

				<title>Probabilistic landslide hazards and risk mapping on Penang Island, Malaysia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0661-0672</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with landslide hazards and risk analysis of Penang Island, Malaysia using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data. Landslide locations in the study area were identiﬁed from interpretations of aerial photographs and ﬁeld surveys. Topographical/ geological data and satellite images were collected and processed using GIS and image processing tools. There are ten landslide inducing parameters which are considered for landslide hazard analysis. These parameters are topographic slope, aspect, curvature and distance from drainage, all derived from the topographic database; geology and distance from lineament, derived from the geologic database; landuse from Landsat satellite images; soil from the soil database; precipitation amount, derived from the rainfall database; and the vegetation index value from SPOT satellite images. Landslide susceptibility was analyzed using landslide-occurrence factors employing the probability–frequency ratio model. The results of the analysis were veriﬁed using the landslide location data and compared with the probabilistic model. The accuracy observed was 80.03%. The qualitative landslide hazard analysis was carried out using the frequency ratio model through the map overlay analysis in GIS environment. The accuracy of hazard map was 86.41%. Further, risk analysis was done by studying the landslide hazard map and damageable objects at risk. This information could be used to estimate the risk to population, property and existing infrastructure like transportation network.</p>

					<p>Compressional and shear wave velocities and attenuation measurements have been carried out in some of the borehole samples of acidic, basic and intermediate granulites of Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. The results have been obtained at ambient conditions using ‘time-of-ﬂight’ pulse transmission technique at 1.0MHz frequency. The results show linear relationships between velocity and density, and velocity and attenuation properties of the rocks. The acidic granulites show lower velocities and higher attenuation than the intermediate and basic granulites. The average values of the Poisson’s ratio of acidic, intermediate and basic granulites have been found to be 0.210, 0.241 and 0.279 respectively. The variations in velocities and attenuation in these low porosity crystalline rocks are found to be strongly inﬂuenced by their mineral composition. The laboratory velocity data (extrapolated to high pressure) of the present study and the published ﬁeld velocity data from deep seismic sounding studies indicate that these granulite facies rocks may belong to mid-crustal depths only.</p>

				<title>Plane strain deformation of a multi-layered poroelastic half-space by surface loads</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0685-0694</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Biot linearized quasi-static theory of ﬂuid-inﬁltrated porous materials is used to formulate the problem of the two-dimensional plane strain deformation of a multi-layered poroelastic half-space by surface loads. The Fourier–Laplace transforms of the stresses, displacements, pore pressure and ﬂuid ﬂux in each homogeneous layer of the multi-layered half-space are expressed in terms of six arbitrary constants. Generalized Thomson–Haskell matrix method is used to obtain the deformation ﬁeld. Simpliﬁed explicit expressions for the elements of the 6 &#215; 6 propagator matrix for the poroelastic medium are obtained. As an example of the possible applications of the analytical formulation developed, formal solution is given for normal strip loading, normal line loading and shear line loading.</p>

				<title>Evidence of reworking and resuspension of carbonates during last glacial maximum and early deglacial period along the southwest coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0695-0702</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A gravity core collected from the upper slope of southwest of Quilon at a water depth of 776m (Lat: 8&#176; 12&#8242; 263&#8242;&#8242;N, Long: 76&#176; 28&#8242; 281&#8242;&#8242;E) was analysed for texture (carbonate free), calcium carbonate and organic carbon. Variation in silicic fraction seems  to be controlled by silt, i.e., enrichment from 15 ka BP to 10 ka BP and then constant in Holocene. Below 15 ka BP, the silicic fraction gets depleted compared to the Holocene section with a minimum around 21 ka BP. Clay content remains nearly constant except in the Holocene where it shows an enrichment. Carbonate content of less than 63 micron when computed by subtracting coarse fraction content from the total carbonate suggests that the total carbonates are mainly concentrated in the ﬁner fraction. All these carbonate phases show an inverse relationship with silicic fraction except in Holocene. Below 15 ka BP, CaCO<sub>3</sub> dominates in sediments comprising more than 65%, such an increase is also seen in the coarse fraction. Coarse fraction from these sections contains abundant nodular type aggregates encrusting small forams. This period is marked by a high sedimentation rate comparable to Holocene. These parameters suggest that the productivity and precipitation have increased in the Holocene due to the intensiﬁcation of the southwest monsoon. During the last glacial maximum and early deglacial period the high sedimentation rate indicates redeposition of the carbonates from the existing carbonate lithofacies situated between Quilon and Cape Comorin probably due to the slope instability.</p>

				<title>Platinum group elements and gold in ferromanganese crusts from Afanasiy–Nikitin seamount, equatorial Indian Ocean: Sources and fractionation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0003-0013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The major element relationships in ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts from Afanasiy-Nikitin seamount (ANS), eastern equatorial Indian Ocean, appear to be atypical. High positive correlations (𝑟 = 0.99) between Mn/Co and Fe/Co ratios, and lack of correlation of those ratios with Co, Ce, and Ce/Co, indicate that the ANS Fe-Mn crusts are distinct from Pacific seamount Fe-Mn crusts, and reflect region-specific chemical characteristics. The platinum group elements (PGE: Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) and Au in ANS Fe-Mn crusts are derived from seawater and are mainly of terrestrial origin, with a minor cosmogenic component. The Ru/Rh (0.5-2) and Pt/Ru ratios (7-28) are closely comparable to ratios in continental basalts, whereas Pd/Ir ratios exhibit values (&gt; 2) similar to CI-chondrite (∼1). The chondrite-normalized PGE patterns are similar to those of igneous rocks, except that Pd is relatively depleted. The water depth of Fe-Mn crust formation appears to have a first-order control on both major element and PGE enrichments. These relationships are defined statistically by significant (𝑟 &lt; 0.75) correlations between water depth and Mn/Co, Fe/Co, Ce/Co, Co, and the PGEs. Fractionation of the PGE-Au from seawater during colloidal precipitation of the major-oxide phases is indicated by well-defined linear positive correlations (𝑟 &lt; 0.8) of Co and Ce with Ir, Ru, Rh, and Pt; Au/Co with Mn/Co; and by weak or no correlations of Pd with water depth, Co-normalized major-element ratios, and with the other PGE (𝑟 $mt; 0.5). The strong enrichment of Pt (up to 1 ppm) relative to the other PGE and its positive correlations with Ce and Co demonstrate a common link for the high concentrations of all three elements, which  likely involves an oxidation reaction on the Mn-oxide and Fe-oxyhydroxide surfaces. The documented fractionation of PGE-Au and their positive association with redox sensitive Co and Ce may have applications in reconstructing past-ocean redox conditions and water masses.</p>

				<title>Facies characteristics of the basal part of the Talchir Formation, Talchir Basin, India – depositional history revisited</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0015-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The lowest unit of the Talchir Formation of Talchir Basin, Orissa, was described by pioneer workers as the 'basal oulder bed'. In an attempt to explain the co-existence of gravel and clay, materials of contrasting hydraulic properties, a probable situation resembling the effects of the action of ground-ice enabled boulders to be carried down by sluggish currents resulting in an intermixture of large boulders and fine mud was conceived. Misinterpretation of this conclusion led to a general tendency to describe the 'basal boulder bed' as 'glacial tillite'. However, the unit described as 'basal boulder bed is actually represented by a matrix rich conglomerate with pockets of normally graded silty clay. The present study reveals that the depositional imprints preserved in this part of the sedimentary succession indicate emplacement of successive debris flows generated through remobilization of pre-existing unconsolidated sediments. Small pockets of fine-grained turbidites presumably deposited from the entrained turbidity currents associated with the debris flows suggest the composite character of the debris flow deposit.</p>

				<title>Domainal fabric development, associated microstructures and <i>P-T</i> records attesting to polymetamorphism in a granulite complex of the Eastern Ghats granulite belt, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0021-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The granulite complex around Jenapore, Orissa, Eastern Ghats granulite belt, bears the imprint of two episodes of strong deformation (D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>) attended with foliation (fabric) development ($S_1$ and $S_2$). Two distinct metamorphic events at <i>P-T</i> conditions of ∼900&#176; C at ∼9$kbar$ and ∼600&#176; C at ∼6 $kbar$ are correlated with D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> respectively. The reaction textures in S<sub>1</sub>-microdomains are interpreted to be the product of near isobaric cooling at ∼9 $kbar$ from 950&#176; C to 600&#176;C, whereas those in the $S_2$-microdomains are considered to be the result of an up-pressure trajectory from ∼6 kbar at 600&#176;C. The D<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>1</sub> high <i>P-T</i> granulite event is interpreted to be Archean in age (ca. 3Ga) on the basis of the isotopic data obtained from the charnockite suite of the area. The later relatively low <i>P-T</i> granulite facies event, attendant to D<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>2</sub> is considered to be related to the Grenvillian orogeny as represented by the dominant isotopic record in the belt.</p>

				<title>The effects of attenuation and site on the spectra of microearthquakes in the Jubilee Hills region of Hyderabad, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0037-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microearthquake spectra from Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad are analyzed to observe the effect of attenuation and site on these spectra. The ratios of spectral amplitudes at lower and higher frequency are measured for three different stations at varying epicentral distances to estimate Q value for both P- and S-wave in near and sub-surface layer. Average estimates of Qp and Qs are 235 and 278 respectively. Value of Qs/Qp larger than 1.0 suggests dry crust for most of the Jubilee Hills region. The near-surface low Qp and Qs for 0 km to 0.9 km depth coincide with the soil layer, top and semi-weathered and highly fractured zone. In contrast, at a shallower depth beneath the Jubilee Hills area, Hyderabad, we obtain high Qp and Qs zone, which corresponds to the dense and high velocity rocks of the region. The varying corner frequencies for these spectra are inferred to be characteristics of site. Comparisons of disparity in spectral content with reference to hard rock site conclude that lithology of the northwest part of Jubilee Hills area amplify about twice the incoming seismic signal, as compared to the southern part best outlined at 8 to 10Hz only.</p>

				<title>Spatial analyses of groundwater levels using universal kriging</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0049-0055</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For water levels, generally a non-stationary variable, the technique of universal kriging is applied in preference to ordinary kriging as the interpolation method. Each set of data in every sector can fit different empirical semivariogram models since they have different spatial structures. These models can be classified as circular, spherical, tetraspherical, pentaspherical, exponential, gaussian, rational quadratic, hole effect, K-bessel, J-bessel and stable. This study aims to determine which of these empirical semivariogram models will be best matched with the experimental models obtained from groundwater-table values collected from Mustafakemalpasa left bank irrigation scheme in 2002. The model having the least error was selected by comparing the observed water-table values with the values predicted by empirical semivariogram models. It was determined that the rational quadratic empirical semivariogram model is the best fitted model for the studied irrigation area.</p>

				<title>The light transmission and seiche depth of Izmir Bay, western Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0057-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Izmir Bay is one of the most polluted estuaries in the whole Mediterranean Sea. The inner part of the Bay (Inner Bay) is heavily affected by domestic and industrial discharge. As a result of these loads, strong eutrophication occurs in the Inner Bay, which is temporally anaerobic. The ecologically sensitive approach of the local authorities during the last decade has given rise to a wide variety of monitoring and research studies on this bay. On the other hand, the municipality of Izmir started to operate wastewater treatment facilities since January 2000. The Institute of Marine Sciences and Technology - Izmir (IMST) with its research vessel R/V K Piri Reis has been conducting an intensive monitoring program since 1988 and especially during the recent few years. These investigations provide an opportunity for the evaluation of the performance of the wastewater treatment plant in terms of the change in the optical properties of Izmir Bay water in a positive manner. The turbidity values measured in these monitoring studies indicate that the values have changed drastically after January 2000. Their spatial variation indicates that the values decrease from the Inner Bay towards the Aegean Sea. The turbidity (light transmission) values are measured with an automatic CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) system during each cruise. The seiche disc depth measurement is carried out only occasionally. The accuracy of the seiche disc depth is dependent on certain daylight conditions and depends on the operator. The seiche disc depth <i>(D_s)</i> is an important parameter to estimate primary production of organic matter (hereafter called production). A relation between light transmission (turbidity) value and seiche disc depth <i>(D_s)</i> is found with very good agreement. The correlations are very high (approximately 0.94) with slight seasonal variation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The search for new parameters for predicting the all India summer monsoon rainfall (AISMR) has been an important aspect of long range prediction of AISMR. In recent years NCEP/NCAR reanalysis has improved the geographical coverage and availability of the data and this can be easily updated. In this study using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data on temperature, zonal and meridional wind at different pressure levels, few predictors are identified and a prediction scheme is developed for predicting AISMR. The regression coeffcients are computed by stepwise multiple regression procedure. The final equation explained 87% of the variance with multiple correlation coeffcient (MCC), 0.934. The estimated rainfall in the El-Nino year of 1997 was -1.7% as against actual of 4.4%. The estimated rainfall deficiency in both the recent deficient years of 2002 and 2004 were -19.5% and -8.5% as against observed -20.4% and -11.5% respectively.</p>

				<title>Impact cratering – fundamental process in geoscience and planetary science</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0081-0098</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Impact cratering is a geological process characterized by ultra-fast strain rates, which generates extreme shock pressure and shock temperature conditions on and just below planetary surfaces. Despite initial skepticism, this catastrophic process has now been widely accepted by geoscientists with respect to its importance in terrestrial – indeed, in planetary – evolution. About 170 impact structures have been discovered on Earth so far, and some more structures are considered to be of possible impact origin. One major extinction event, at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, has been ﬁrmly linked with catastrophic impact, but whether other important extinction events in Earth history, including the so-called “Mother of All Mass Extinctions” at the Permian–Triassic boundary, were triggered by huge impact catastrophes is still hotly debated and a subject of ongoing research. There is a beneﬁcial side to impact events as well, as some impact structures worldwide have been shown to contain signiﬁcant (in some cases, world class) ore deposits, including the gold– uranium province of the Witwatersrand basin in South Africa, the enormous Ni and PGE deposits of the Sudbury structure in Canada, as well as important hydrocarbon resources, especially in North America. Impact cratering is not a process of the past, and it is mandatory to improve knowledge of the past-impact record on Earth to better constrain the probability of such events in the future. In addition, further improvement of our understanding of the physico–chemical and geological processes fundamental to the impact cratering process is required for reliable numerical modeling of the process, and also for the correlation of impact magnitude and environmental effects. Over the last few decades, impact cratering has steadily grown into an integrated discipline comprising most disciplines of the geosciences as well as planetary science, which has created positive spin-offs including the study of paleo-environments and paleo-climatology, or the important issue of life in extreme environments. And yet, in many parts of the world, the impact process is not yet part of the geoscience curriculum, and for this reason, it deserves to be actively promoted not only as a geoscientiﬁc discipline in its own right, but also as an important life-science discipline.</p>

				<title>Quasi-static deformation due to two-dimensional seismic sources embedded in an elastic half-space in welded contact with a poroelastic half-space</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0099-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Biot linearized theory of ﬂuid saturated porous materials is used to study the plane strain deformation of a two-phase medium consisting of a homogeneous, isotropic, poroelastic half-space in welded contact with a homogeneous, isotropic, perfectly elastic half-space caused by a twodimensional source in the elastic half-space. The integral expressions for the displacements and stresses in the two half-spaces in welded contact are obtained from the corresponding expressions for an unbounded elastic medium by applying suitable boundary conditions at the interface. The case of a long dip-slip fault is discussed in detail. The integrals for this source are solved analytically for two limiting cases: (i) undrained conditions in the high frequency limit, and (ii) steady state drained conditions as the frequency approaches zero. It has been veriﬁed that the solution for the drained case (𝜔 → 0) coincides with the known elastic solution. The drained and undrained displacements and stresses are compared graphically. Diffusion of the pore pressure with time is also studied.</p>

				<title>Neotectonic aspects of the northern margin of the Adana–Cilicia submarine basin, NE Mediterranean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0113-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sedimentary basins that dominate the north-eastern Mediterranean (Adana–Cilicia basins in the west and Iskenderun basin in the east) are located on the ﬂanks of a partly submerged positive structure (a part of the Africa–Eurasia convergence zone) along which strike-slip faults are evident. This study summarizes the ﬁndings of two seismic surveys carried out in the Alanya– Mersin offshore region. Some 850 km of geophysical survey lines were compiled on these cruises. Based on the results determined from these surveys, the north and central part of Adana–Cilicia basin can be subdivided into eastern, central and western structural sub-basins separated by the Ecemiş fault complex in the east and the Anamur–Kormakiti  structural high in the west at the same time. Results of this study also indicate that Ecemiş and Anamur–Kormakiti faults are active. Late Miocene regional compression was responsible for the compartmentation of this complex into the present arrangement and has initiated the rotational regime which has governed subsequent tectonic developments, notably the extensional behaviour of the NE–SW trending Ecemiş and Anamur–Kormakiti faults and the transpressive behaviour of the NNE–SSW trending border fault complex.</p>

				<title>Depositional conditions of the coal-bearing Hirka Formation beneath Late Miocene explosive volcanic products in NW central Anatolia, Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0125-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work focuses on the relationship between the coal deposition and explosive volcanism of the Miocene basin, NW central Anatolia, Turkey. The coal-bearing Hirka Formation was deposited over the Galatian Andesitic Complex and/or massive lagoonal environments during the Miocene. The investigated lignite is a high ash (from 32 to 58%) and sulphur (from 1.43 to 3.03%) lignite which is petrographically characterised by a high humunite content. The mineral matter of the studied lignite samples is made up of mainly clay minerals (illite–smectite and kaolinite), plagioclase and quartz in Bolu coal ﬁeld, clay minerals (illite–smectite, smectite and illite), quartz, calcite, plagioclase and gypsum in Seben coal ﬁeld, quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and clay minerals (kaolinite and illite) in Kıbrıscık, and dolomite, quartz, clinoptilolite, opal CT and gypsum in C¸ amlıdere coal ﬁeld. The differences in these four types of lignite with speciﬁc mineralogical patterns may be due to the explosive volcanic events and depositional conditions which changed from one coal ﬁeld to the others. There is a zonation from SW to SE in the studied area for zeolites such as Opal CT+smectite-clinoptilolite-analcime-K-feldspar. Carbonate minerals are commonly calcite in Seben and Kıbrıscık coal ﬁelds. In Bolu, coal samples are devoid of calcite and dolomite. These analyses show that there is an increase in the amount of Mg and a decrease in the amount of Na from the northwestern part to the southern part in the study area.</p>

				<title>Volatile displacement of Meghalaya coals – A pointer to explore low sulphur coals</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0137-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Volatile displacement, which measures the difference between calculated and experimental volatile matter, is indicative of abnormality in coals which may be related to petrological or chemical parameters. The volatile displacement (𝛿 $v$) values of Meghalaya coals were calculated from their chemical analyses. Correlations of volatile displacement ($\delta v$) with parameters such as carbon, hydrogen, moisture, oxygen, oxygen plus sulphate sulphur, oxygen plus pyritic sulphur, oxygen plus organic sulphur and total sulphur were studied. An approximately linear relationship exists only between $\delta v$ and moisture, and $\delta v$ and total sulphur, and not between other parameters. Plots on Seyler’s chart indicate the coals as perhydrous to orthohydrous. The linear relationship with total sulphur indicates that the coals may have become abnormal mainly due to the marine environment of deposition and weathering.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the occurrence of vesuvianite + wollastonite + grossular + diopside + microcline + quartz assemblage in an enclave of calc-silicate rocks occurring within quartzofeldspathic gneiss near Tatapani in the western part of Chhotanagpur Gneissic Complex. The enclave contains phlogopite-absent and phlogopite-bearing calc-silicate rocks, the latter being much more abundant than the former. The above assemblage occurs in the phlogopite-absent rock. Phlogopite-bearing rock contains the assemblage phlogopite + salite + microcline + plagioclase + quartz. A strong schistosity is developed in both the calc-silicate rocks and the minerals are syntectonic with the major foliation-forming event in the area. The vesuvianite-bearing assemblage is formed by amphibolite facies regional metamorphism of a calcareous protolith at pressure &gt; 4 kbar and $X_{CO_2}$ (ﬂuid) &gt; 0.15.</p>

				<title>The role of low-frequency intraseasonal oscillations in the anomalous Indian summer monsoon rainfall of 2002</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0149-0157</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze the dynamical features and responsible factors of the low-frequency intraseasonal time scales which inﬂuenced the nature of onset, intensity and duration of active/break phases and withdrawal of the monsoon during the anomalous Indian summer monsoon of 2002 – the most severe drought recorded in recent times. During that season, persistent warm sea surface temperature anomalies over the equatorial Indian Ocean played a signiﬁcant role in modulating the strength of the monsoon Hadley circulation. This in turn affected the onset and intense break spells especially the long break during the peak monsoon month of July. Strong low-frequency intraseasonal modulations with signiﬁcant impact on the onset and active/break phases occurred in 2002 which were manifested as a good association between low-frequency intraseasonal oscillations and the onset and active/break spells. Further, SST anomalies over the equatorial Indo-Paciﬁc region on low-frequency intraseasonal time scales were found to affect the equatorial eastward and thereby off-equatorial northward propagations of enhanced convection over the Indian region. These propagations in turn modulated the active/break cycle deciding the consequent severity of the 2002 drought.</p>

				<title>Sensitivity of surface radiation budget to clouds over the Asian monsoon region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0159-0169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the ISCCP–FD surface radiative ﬂux data for the summer season (June to September) of the period 1992 to 1995, an analysis was done to understand the role of clouds on the surface radiation budget over the Asian monsoon region. At the top of atmosphere (TOA) of convective regions of the Asian monsoon region, the short wave radiative forcing (SWCRF)  and long wave radiative forcing (LWCRF) do not cancel each other resulting in occurrence of the net cloud radiative forcing values exceeding $−$30W/m<sup>2</sup>. This type of imbalance between SWCRF and LWCRF at TOA is reﬂected down on the earth surface–atmosphere system also as an imbalance between surface netcloud radiative forcing (NETCRF) and atmospheric NETCRF.</p>
					<p>Based on the regression analysis of the cloud effects on the surface radiation budget quantities, it has been observed that generally, the variance explained by multiple type cloud data is 50% more than that of total cloud cover alone. In case of SWCRF, the total cloud cover can explain about 3% (7%) of the variance whereas the three cloud type descriptions of clouds can explain about 44% (42%) of the variance over oceanic (land) regions. This highlights the importance of cloud type information in explaining the variations of surface radiation budget. It has been observed that the clouds produce more cooling effect in short-wave band than the warming effect in long-wave band resulting in a net cooling at the surface. Over the oceanic region, variations in high cloud amount contribute more to variations in SWCRF while over land regions both middle and high cloud variations make substantial contributions to the variations in both SWCRF and NETCRF.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper attempts at full characterization of the unique global 8.2Kyr B.P. cooling event. Significant atmospheric cooling started during 9.5–8.5Kyr B.P. when the Sun was extremely quiet during three periods of ∼50–100 years. The flood of melt water in the N. Atlantic from glacial lakes during the demise of the Laurentide ice sheet, starting at ∼8.5$Kyr$ B.P., adds to the atmospheric cooling. Climatic forcing events occurred at 8.5Kyr B.P., at 8.2Kyr B.P. and finally at 8.06Kyr B.P., leading to concurrent increases or decreases in the atmospheric 𝛥<sup>14</sup>C levels, completely consistent with the climatic forcing proposed here.</p>

				<title>Fairweather atmospheric electricity at Antarctica during local summer as observed from Indian station, Maitri</title>

				<page>0179-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface measurements of the atmospheric electrical parameters like Maxwell current, electric field and conductivity studied at the Indian station, Maitri (70.75&#176;S, 11.75&#176;E, 117m above mean sea level), Antarctica, during austral summer have been analyzed for the years 2001 to 2004. A total of 69 days were selected which satisfied the ‘fairweather’ conditions, i.e., days with absence of high winds, drifting or falling snow, clouds, and fog effects. The diurnal variation curve of electric field and vertical current averaged for 69 fairweather days is a single periodic with a minimum at 03:00UT and a maximum near 19:00UT, which is very similar to the Carnegie curve. The correlation coefficient between these measured parameters has a high value (more than 0.9) for all the days. During fairweather days the measured current and field variations are similar and hence it is clear that the conductivity is more or less stable. During magnetically disturbed days, the dawn-dusk potential drop has clear influences on the diurnal variation and it modifies the conductivity. Apart from the day-to-day variation in low latitude thunderstorm activity, there are diurnal, seasonal, inter-annual variations in the electric potential and the currents, as well as solar influences on the measured parameters. This study will help us to examine the impact of solar and geophysical phenomena like solar flares, geomagnetic storms and substorms on the global electric circuit.</p>

				<title>Rainfall analysis for Indian monsoon region using the merged rain gauge observations and satellite estimates: Evaluation of monsoon rainfall features</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0187-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Objective analysis of daily rainfall at the resolution of 1&#176; grid for the Indian monsoon region has been carried out merging dense land rainfall observations and INSAT derived precipitation estimates. This daily analysis, being based on high dense rain gauge observations was found to be very realistic and able to reproduce detailed features of Indian summer monsoon. The inter-comparison with the observations suggests that the new analysis could distinctly capture characteristic features of the summer monsoon such as north–south oriented belt of heavy rainfall along the Western Ghats with sharp gradient of rainfall between the west coast heavy rain region and the rain shadow region to the east, pockets of heavy rainfall along the location of monsoon trough/low, over the east central parts of the country, over north–east India, along the foothills of Himalayas and over the north Bay of Bengal. When this product was used to assess the quality of other available standard climate products (CMAP and ECMWF reanalysis) at the grid resolution of 2.5&#176;, it was found that the orographic heavy rainfall along Western Ghats of India was poorly identified by them. However, the GPCC analysis (gauge only) at the resolution of 1&#176; grid closely discerns the new analysis. This suggests that there is a need for a higher resolution analysis with adequate rain gauge observations to retain important aspects of the summer monsoon over India. The case studies illustrated show that the daily analysis is able to capture large-scale as well as mesoscale features of monsoon precipitation systems. This study with data of two seasons (2001 and 2003) has shown sufficiently promising results for operational application, particularly for the validation of NWP models.</p>

				<page>0199-0214</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Peninsular India (PI), which lies south of 24&#176;N latitude, has experienced several devastating earthquakes in the past. However, very few strong motion records are available for developing attenuation relations for ground acceleration, required by engineers to arrive at rational design response spectra for construction sites and cities in PI. Based on a well-known seismological model, the present paper statistically simulates ground motion in PI to arrive at an empirical relation for estimating 5% damped response spectra, as a function of magnitude and source to site distance, covering bedrock and soil conditions. The standard error in the proposed relationship is reported as a function of the frequency, for further use of the results in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.</p>

				<title>Seismicity pattern in north Sumatra–Great Nicobar region: In search of precursor for the 26 December 2004 earthquake</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0215-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyse the seismicity pattern including 𝑏-value in the north Sumatra–Great Nicobar region from 1976 to 2004. The analysis suggests that there were a number of significant, intermediate and short-term precursors before the magnitude 7.6 earthquake of 2 November 2002. However, they were not found to be so prominent prior to the magnitude 9.0 earthquake of 26 December 2004 though downward migration of activity and a 50-day short-term quiescence was observed before the event. The various precursors identified include post-seismic and intermediate-term quiescence of 13 and 10 years respectively, between the 1976 (magnitude 6.3) and 2002 earthquakes with two years (1990–1991) of increase in background seismicity; renewed seismicity, downward migration of seismic activity and foreshocks in 2002, just before the mainshock. Spatial variation in 𝑏-value with time indicates precursory changes in the form of high 𝑏-value zone near the epicenter preceding the mainshocks of 2004 and 2002 and temporal rise in 𝑏-value in the epicentral area before the 2002 earthquake.</p>

				<title>Elastic waves along a cylindrical borehole in a poroelastic medium saturated by two immiscible fluids</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0225-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of elastic waves along a cylindrical borehole filled with/without liquid and embedded in an infinite porous medium saturated by two immiscible fluids has been studied. The theory of porous media saturated by two immiscible fluids developed by Tuncay and Corapcioglu (1997) is employed. Frequency equations determining the phase velocity of axial symmetric waves are obtained. It is found that the surface waves along cylindrical borehole are dispersive. The dispersion equation of Rayleigh-type surface waves along the boundary of a poroelastic solid half-space saturated by two immiscible fluids is also obtained. Some special cases have been deduced and the dispersion curves are obtained numerically for a peculiar model. It is found that the density of fluids affects the Rayleigh mode.</p>

				<title>Monitoring the three-dimensional ionospheric electron density distribution using GPS observations over China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0235-0244</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, an IRI model assisted GPS-based Computerized Ionospheric Tomography (CIT) technique is developed to inverse the ionospheric electron density (IED) distribution over China. Essentially, an improved algebraic reconstruction technique (IART) is first proposed to reconstruct the ionospheric images with high resolution and high efficiency. A numerical experiment is used to validate the reliability of the method and its advantages to the classical algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). This is then used to reconstruct the IED images using the GPS data in China. The variations of the IED during magnetically quiet and disturbed days are reported and analyzed here. Reconstructed results during magnetically quiet days show some prominent ionospheric features such as the development of equatorial anomaly and the tilt of ionization crest. Meanwhile, ionospheric storm phase effects and disturbed features can also be revealed from the reconstructed IED image under storm conditions. Research shows that the positive storm phase effects usually happen in southern China, and the negative storm phase effects mainly occur in northern China. The equatorial anomaly crest moved to the north in the main phase of the storm. Ionosonde data recorded at Wuhan station provides the verification for the reliability of GPS-based CIT technique.</p>

					<p>Banded iron-formations (BIF) form an important part of the Archean supracrustal belts of the Jharkhand–Orissa region, India. Major, trace and REE chemistry of the banded iron-formation of the Gandhamardan, Deo Nala, Gorumahisani and Noamundi sections of the Jharkhand–Orissa region are utilized to explore the source of metals and to address the thermal regime of the basin floor and the redox conditions of the archean sea. Hydrothermal fluids of variable temperatures might have contributed the major part of the Fe and other trace elements to the studied banded iron-formations. Diagenetic fluids from the sea floor sediments and river water might have played a subdued role in supplying the Fe and other elements for the banded iron-formations.</p>

				<title>Improved bathymetric datasets for the shallow water regions in the Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0261-0274</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ocean modellers use bathymetric datasets like ETOPO5 and ETOPO2 to represent the ocean bottom topography. The former dataset is based on digitization of depth contours greater  than 200m, and the latter is based on satellite altimetry. Hence, they are not always reliable in shallow regions. An improved shelf bathymetry for the Indian Ocean region (20&#176;E to 112&#176;E and 38&#176;S to 32&#176;N) is derived by digitizing the depth contours and sounding depths less than 200m from the hydrographic charts published by the National Hydrographic Office, India. The digitized data are then gridded and used to modify the existing ETOPO5 and ETOPO2 datasets for depths less than 200 m. In combining the digitized data with the original ETOPO dataset, we apply an appropriate blending technique near the 200m contour to ensure smooth merging of the datasets. Using the modified ETOPO5, we demonstrate that the original ETOPO5 is indeed inaccurate in depths of less than 200m and has features that are not actually present on the ocean bottom. Though the present version of ETOPO2 (ETOPO2v2) is a better bathymetry compared to its earlier versions, there are still differences between the ETOPO2v2 and the modified ETOPO2. We assess the improvements of these bathymetric grids with the performance of existing models of tidal circulation and tsunami propagation.</p>

				<title>Assimilation of Doppler weather radar observations in a mesoscale model for the prediction of rainfall associated with mesoscale convective systems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0275-0304</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Obtaining an accurate initial state is recognized as one of the biggest challenges in accurate model prediction of convective events. This work is the first attempt in utilizing the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Doppler radar data in a numerical model for the prediction of mesoscale convective complexes around Chennai and Kolkata. Three strong convective events both over Chennai and Kolkata have been considered for the present study. The simulation experiments have been carried out using fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) mesoscale model (MM5) version 3.5.6. The variational data assimilation approach is one of the most promising tools available for directly assimilating the mesoscale observations in order to improve the initial state. The horizontal wind derived from the DWR has been used alongwith other conventional and non-conventional data in the assimilation system. The preliminary results from the three dimensional variational (3DVAR) experiments are encouraging. The simulated rainfall has also been compared with that derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The encouraging result from this study can be the basis for further investigation of the direct assimilation of radar reflectivity data in 3DVAR system. The present study indicates that Doppler radar data assimilation improves the initial field and enhances the Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF) skill.</p>

				<title>Surface and upper air meteorological features during onset phase of 2003 monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0305-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The second campaign of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX-II) was conducted in two phases viz., March–April and May–June 2003. In the present work, the buoy and ocean research vessel data collected during the second phase of ARMEX-II have been analysed to bring out the characteristic features of monsoon onset. The results have shown that the thermodynamical features such as build up of lower tropospheric instability and increased height of zero degree isotherm occurred about a week before the monsoon onset over Kerala and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea. There was a sharp fall in the temperature difference between 850 and 500 hPa, and the height of zero degree isotherm about 2–3 days before the monsoon onset. The flux of sensible heat was positive (sea to air) over south Arabian Sea during the onset phase. Over the Bay of Bengal higher negative (air to sea) values of sensible flux prevailed before the  monsoon onset which became less negative with the advance of monsoon over that region.</p>
					<p>The pre-onset period was characterized by large sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the Arabian Sea with rapid decrease towards north of the warm pool region. The buoy observations have shown that SST remained close to 30.5&#176;C in the warm pool region during the pre-onset period in 2003 but only 2–3 degrees away (north of this region) SSTs were as low as 28.5-29&#176;C. An interesting aspect of sea level pressure (SLP) variability over the Indian seas during the onset phase of summer monsoon 2003 was undoubtedly, the highest SLP in the warm pool region inspite of very high SSTs.</p>

				<title>Maximum daily rainfall in South Korea</title>

				<page>0311-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Annual maxima of daily rainfall for the years 1961–2001 are modeled for five locations in South Korea (chosen to give a good geographical representation of the country). The generalized extreme value distribution is fitted to data from each location to describe the extremes of rainfall and to predict its future behavior. We find evidence to suggest that the Gumbel distribution provides the most reasonable model for four of the five locations considered. We explore the possibility of trends in the data but find no evidence suggesting trends. We derive estimates of 10, 50, 100, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000 and 100,000 year return levels for daily rainfall and describe how they vary with the locations. This paper provides the first application of extreme value distributions to rainfall data from South Korea.</p>

				<title>Identification of homogeneous rainfall regimes in parts of Western Ghats region of Karnataka</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0321-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In view of the ongoing environmental and ecological changes in the Western Ghats, it is important to understand the environmental parameters pertaining to the sustenance of the region. Rainfall is one such parameter governing the hydrological processes crucial to agriculture planning, afforestation and eco-system management. Therefore, it is essential to understand rainfall distribution and its variation in relevance to such activities. The present study is an attempt to gain in-depth understanding in this direction. The study area comprises of one coastal district and its adjoining areas in Karnataka State. Mean annual rainfall data of 93 rain gauge stations distributed over the study area for a period of 10–50 years are used for the study. In order to assess the variation of rainfall across the ghats, several bands were constructed parallel to the latitudes to facilitate the analysis. The statistical analyses conducted included cluster analysis and analysis of variance. The study revealed that there exist three distinct zones of rainfall regimes in the study area, namely, Coastal zone, Transition zone and Malanad zone. It is observed that, the maximum rainfall occurs on the windward side ahead of the geographical peak. Further, mean monthly rainfall distribution over the zones has been depicted to enable agricultural planning in the study area.</p>

				<title>Vertical propagation of baroclinic Kelvin waves along the west coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0331-0339</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A linear, continuously stratified ocean model is used to investigate vertical propagation of remotely forced, baroclinic Kelvin waves along the Indian west coast. The extent of vertical propagation over  the length of the coast is found to be an increasing function of the forcing frequency. Simulations show that, over the length of the Indian west coast, vertical propagation is limited  at annual and semi-annual periods, but significant at periods shorter than about 120 days. This has two major consequences. First, the depth of subsurface currents associated with these frequencies varies substantially along the coast. Second, baroclinic Kelvin waves generated in the Bay of Bengal at periods shorter than about 120 days have negligible influence on surface currents along the north Indian west coast.</p>

				<title>Discharge estimation from planform characters of the Shedhi River, Gujarat alluvial plain: Present and past</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0341-0346</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the absence of long-term hydrologic and streamflow records an understanding of river morphology (present and past) can help delineate changes in magnitudes of water and sediment discharges. The relict drainage system of Gujarat alluvial plain provides an opportunity to reconstruct the palaeochannel morphology-related discharge estimations. In this paper, based on the geomorphological evidence and channel geometry, an attempt has been made to reconstruct the palaeohydrological condition in the Shedhi River during the Holocene. A comparison of the present day channel of the Shedhi River with that of its palaeo counterpart reveals that the former was carrying much higher bankfull discharge (∼5500m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) as compared to the present (∼200m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>). This is attributed to a larger drainage area and enhanced precipitation in the Shedhi River basin.</p>

				<title>2-D Crustal thermal structure along Thuadara–Sindad DSS profile across Narmada– Son lineament, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0347-0355</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Central India is traversed by a WSW–ENE trending Narmada–Son lineament (NSL) which is characterized by the presence of numerous hot springs, feeder dykes for Deccan Traps and seismicity all along its length. It is divided in two parts by the Barwani–Sukta Fault (BSF). To the west of this fault a graben exists, whereas to the east the basement is uplifted between Narmada North Fault (NNF) and Narmada South Fault (NSF). The present work deals with the 2-D thermal modeling to delineate the crustal thermal structure of the western part of NSL region  along the Thuadara–Sindad Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profile which runs almost in the N–S direction across the NSL. Numerical results of the model reveal that the conductive surface heat flow value in the region under consideration varies between 45 and 47mW/m<sup>2</sup>. Out of which 23mW/m<sup>2</sup> is the contribution from the mantle heat flow and the remaining from within the crust. The Curie depth is found to vary between 46 and 47 km and is in close agreement with the earlier reported Curie depth estimated from the analysis of MAGSAT data. The Moho temperature varies between 470 and 500&#176;C. This study suggests that this western part of central Indian region is characterized by low mantle heat flow which in turn makes the lower crust brittle and amenable to the occurrence of deep focused earthquakes such as Satpura (1938) earthquake.</p>

				<title>Wave propagation in a general anisotropic poroelastic medium: Biot’s theories and homogenisation theory</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0357-0367</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Anisotropic wave propagation is studied in a fluid-saturated porous medium, using two different approaches. One is the dynamic approach of Biot’s theories. The other approach known as homogenisation theory, is based on the averaging process to derive macroscopic equations from the microscopic equations of motion. The medium considered is a general anisotropic poroelastic (APE) solid with a viscous fluid saturating its pores of anisotropic permeability. The wave propagation phenomenon in a saturated porous medium is explained through two relations. One defines modified Christoffel equations for the propagation of plane harmonic waves in the medium. The other defines a matrix to relate the relative displacement of fluid particles to the displacement of solid particles. The modified Christoffel equations are solved further to get a quartic equation whose roots represent complex velocities of the four attenuating quasi-waves in the medium. These complex velocities define the phase velocities of propagation and quality factors for attenuation of all the quasi-waves propagating along a given phase direction in three-dimensional space. The derivations in the mathematical models from different theories are compared in order to work out the equivalence between them. The variations of phase velocities and attenuation factors with the direction of phase propagation are computed, for a realistic numerical model. Differences between the velocities and attenuations of quasi-waves from the two approaches are exhibited numerically.</p>

				<title>Current status of multimodel superensemble and operational NWP forecast of the Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0369-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the last thirty years great strides have been made by large-scale operational numerical weather prediction models towards improving skills for the medium range time-scale of 7 days.This paper illustrates the use of these current forecasts towards the construction of a consensus multimodel forecast product called the superensemble.This procedure utilizes 120 of the recent-past forecasts from these models to arrive at the training phase statistics. These statistics are described by roughly 10<sup>7</sup> weights.Use of these weights provides the possibility for real-time medium range forecasts with the superensemble.We show the recent status of this procedure towards real-time forecasts for the Asian summer monsoon.The member models of our suite include ECMWF,NCEP/EMC, JMA,NOGAPS (US Navy),BMRC,RPN (Canada)and an FSU global spectral forecast model. We show in this paper the skill scores for day 1 through day 6 of forecasts from standard variables such as winds,temperature,500 hPa geopotential height,sea level pressure and precipitation.In all cases we noted that the superensemble carries a higher skill compared to each of the member models and their ensemble mean.The skill matrices we use include the RMS errors,the anomaly correlations and equitable threat scores.For many of these forecasts the improvements of skill for the superensemble over the best model was found to be quite substantial.This real-time product is being provided to many interested research groups.The FSU multimodel superensemble,in real- time,stands out for providing the least errors among all of the operational large scale models.</p>

				<title>Link between convection and meridional gradient of sea surface temperature in the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0385-0406</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We use daily satellite estimates of sea surface temperature (SST)and rainfall during 1998 –2005 to show that onset of convection over the central Bay of Bengal (88-92&#176;E, 14-18&#176;N)during the core summer monsoon (mid-May to September)is linked to the meridional gradient of SST in the bay.The SST gradient was computed between two boxes in the northern (88-92&#176;E, 18-22&#176;N) and southern (82-88&#176;E, 4-8&#176;N) bay; the latter is the area of the cold tongue in the bay linked to the Summer Monsoon Current.Convection over central bay followed the SST difference between the northern and southern bay (𝛥 𝑇) exceeding 0.75&#176;C in 28 cases.There was no instance of 𝛥 𝑇 exceeding this threshold without a burst in convection.There were,however,ﬁve instances of convection occurring without this SST gradient.Long rainfall events (events lasting more than a week)were associated with an SST event (𝛥 𝑇 &#8805; 0.75&#176;C);rainfall events tended to be short when not associated with an SST event.The SST gradient was important for the onset of convection, but not for its persistence:convection often persisted for several days even after the SST gradient weakened.The lag between 𝛥 𝑇 exceeding 0.75&#176;C and the onset of convection was 0-18 days,but the lag histogram peaked at one week.In 75% of the 28 cases,convection occurred within a week of 𝛥 𝑇 exceeding the threshold of 0.75&#176;C. The northern bay SST, <i>T_N</i> contributed more to 𝛥 𝑇 but it was a weaker criterion for convection than the SST gradient.A sensitivity analysis showed that the corresponding threshold for <i>T_N</i> was 29&#176;C. We hypothesise that the excess heating (∼1&#176; C above the threshold for deep convection)required in the northern bay to trigger convection is because this excess in SST is what is required to establish the critical SST gradient.</p>

				<title>GPS satellite and receiver instrumental biases estimation using least squares method for accurate ionosphere modelling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0407-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The positional accuracy of the Global Positioning System (GPS)is limited due to several error sources.The major error is ionosphere.By augmenting the GPS,the Category I (CAT  I)Precision Approach (PA)requirements can be achieved.The Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS)in India is known as GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN).One of the prominent errors in GAGAN that limits the positional accuracy is instrumental biases.Calibration of these biases is particularly important in achieving the CAT I PA landings.In this paper,a new algorithm is proposed to estimate the instrumental biases by modelling the TEC using 4th order polynomial.The algorithm uses values corresponding to a single station for one month period and the results conﬁrm the validity of the algorithm.The experimental results indicate that the estimation precision of the satellite-plus-receiver instrumental bias is of the order of ± 0.17 nsec.The observed mean bias error is of the order − 3.638 nsec and − 4.71 nsec for satellite 1 and 31 respectively.It is found that results are consistent over the period.</p>

				<title>Strike slip faulting inferred from offsetting of drainages: Lower Narmada basin, western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0413-0421</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The detailed analysis of landforms,drainages and geology of the area between the rivers Amaravati and Karjan was carried out in order to understand the tectonic history of the lower Narmada basin. Movement along the various faults in the area was studied on the basis of the drainage offsetting. Horizontal offsetting of stream channels was found quite demonstrable along NNW –SSE trending transverse faults.Tectonic landforms including systematic de ﬂection of stream channels and ridges, alignment of fault scarp and saddles and displacement in the basement rocks and alluvial deposits show that the area is undergoing active deformation driven by the NSF system.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polyphase deformation and metamorphism of pelitic schists of Chorbaoli Formation of Sausar Group in and around Ramtek area,Nagpur district,Maharashtra,India has led to the development of garnet and staurolite porphyroblasts in a predominantly quartz –mica matrix.Microstructural study of oriented thin sections of these rocks shows that garnet and staurolite have different growth histories and these porphyroblasts share a complex relationship with the matrix.Garnet shows at least two phases of growth –ﬁrst intertectonic between D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> (pre-D<sub>2</sub> phase)and then syn-tectonic to post-tectonic with respect to D<sub>2</sub> deformation.Growth of later phase of garnet on the earlier (pre-D<sub>2</sub> garnet grains has led to the discordance of quartz inclusion trails between core and rim portion of the same garnet grain.Staurolite develops only syn-D<sub>2</sub> and shows close association with garnet of the later phase.The peak metamorphic temperature thus coincided with D<sub>2</sub> deformation,which developed the dominant crenulation schistosity ($S_2$ ,regionally persistent in the terrain.The metamorphic grade reached up to middle amphibolite facies in the study area, which is higher than the adjoining southern parts of Sausar Fold Belt.</p>

				<title>Advective heat transfer and fabric development in a shallow crustal intrusive granite – the case of Proterozoic Vellaturu granite, south India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0433-0450</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Syntectonic plutons emplaced in shallow crust often contain intermediate-to low-temperature deformation microstructures but lack a high-temperature, subsolidus deformation fabric,although the relict magmatic fabric is preserved. The Proterozoic Vellaturu granite emplaced at the eastern margin of the northern Nallamalai fold belt,south India during the late phase of regional deformation has a common occurrence of intermediate-to low-temperature deformation fabric, superimposed over magmatic fabric with an internally complex pattern. But high-T subsolidus deformation microstructure and fabric are absent in this pluton.The main crystal plastic deformation and ﬂuid enhanced reaction softening was concentrated along the margin of the granite body. Resulting granite mylonites show Y-maximum c axis fabric in completely recrystallized quartz ribbons,dynamic recrystallization of perthites,and myrmekite indicative of fabric development under intermediate temperature (∼500-400&#176; C). The weakly-deformed interior shows myrmekite,feldspar microfracturing and limited bulging recrystallization of quartz.The abundance of prism subgrain boundaries is indicative of continuing deformation through low-temperature(∼300&#176; C).The relative rates of cooling in ﬂuenced by advective heat transfer and deformation of the pluton seem to control the overall subsolidus fabric development.The rapid advective heat transfer from the interior in the early stages of subsolidus cooling was followed by slow cooling through intermediate temperature window as a well-developed phyllosilicate rich mylonitic skin around the granite body slowed down conductive heat loss.Low-T crystal plastic deformation of quartz was effected at a late stage of cooling and deformation of the shallow crustal granite body emplaced within the greenschist facies Nallamalai rocks.</p>

				<title>Rainfall intensity characteristics at coastal and high altitude stations in Kerala</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0451-0463</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rainfall intensities measured at a few stations in Kerala during 2001 –2005 using a disdrometer were found to be in reasonable agreement with the total rainfall measured using a manual rain gauge. The temporal distributions of rainfall intensity at different places and during different months show that rainfall is of low intensity (&gt; 10 mm/hr),65%to 90%of the time.This could be an indication of the relative prevalence of stratiform and cumuliform clouds.Rainfall was of intensity &gt; 5 mm/hr for more than 95%of the time in Kochi in July 2002,which was a month seriously deﬁcient in rainfall,indicating that the deﬁciency was probably due to the relative absence of cumuliform clouds.Cumulative distribution graphs are also plotted and ﬁtted with the Weibull distribution.The ﬁt parameters do not appear to have any consistent pattern. The higher intensities also contributed signi ﬁcantly to total rainfall most of the time,except in Munnar (a hill station). In this analysis also,the rainfall in Kochi in July 2002 was found to have less presence of high intensities. This supports the hypothesis that the rainfall de ﬁciency was probably caused by the absence of conditions that favoured the formation of cumuliform clouds.</p>

				<title>Late Devonian and Triassic basalts from the southern continental margin of the East European Platform, tracers of a single heterogeneous lithospheric mantle source</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0469-0495</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In Late Devonian and Early-to-Late Triassic times, the southern continental margin of the Eastern European Platform was the site of a basaltic volcanism in the Donbas and Fore-Caucasus areas respectively. Both volcanic piles rest unconformably upon Paleoproterozoic and Late Paleozoic units respectively, and emplaced during continental rifting periods some 600 km away from expected locations of active oceanic subduction zones.</p>
					<p>This paper reports a comparative geochemical study of the basaltic rocks, and views them as the best tracers of the involved mantle below the Eastern European Platform. The Late Devonian alkaline basic rocks differ from the calc-alkaline Triassic basic rocks by their higher alkali-silica ratio, their higher TiO<sub>2</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>O, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and FeO contents, their higher trace element contents, a higher degree of fractionation between the most and the least incompatible elements and the absence of Ta-Nb negative anomalies. These general features, clearly distinct from those of partial melting and fractional crystallization, are due to mantle source effects. With similar Nd and Sr isotopic signatures indicating mantle-crust mixing, both suites would originate from the melting of a same but heterogeneous continental mantle lithosphere (refertilized depleted mantle). Accordingly the Nd model ages, the youngest major event associated with mantle metasomatism occurred during Early Neoproterozoic times (∼650Ma).</p>

				<title>Geology and geochemistry of giant quartz veins from the Bundelkhand Craton, central India and their implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0497-0510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Giant quartz veins (GQVs; earlier referred to as ‘quartz reefs’) occurring in the Archean Bundelkhand Craton (29, 000 km<sup>2</sup>) represent a gigantic Precambrian (∼2.15 $Ga$) silica-rich fluid activity in the central Indian shield. These veins form a striking curvilinear feature with positive relief having a preferred orientation NE–SW to NNE–SSW in the Bundelkhand Craton. Their outcrop widths vary from &#8804; 1 to 70m and pervasively extend over tens of kilometers along the strike over the entire craton. Numerous younger thin quartz veins with somewhat similar orientation cut across the giant quartz veins. They show imprints of strong brittle to ductile–brittle deformation, and in places are associated with base metal and gold incidences, and pyrophyllite-diaspore mineralization. The geochemistry of giant quartz veins were studied. Apart from presenting new data on the geology and geochemistry of these veins, an attempt has been made to resolve the long standing debate on their origin, in favour of an emplacement due to tectonically controlled polyphase hydrothermal fluid activity.</p>

				<title>Geology and geochemistry of palaeoproterozoic low-grade metabasic volcanic rocks from Salumber area, Aravalli Supergroup, NW India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0511-0524</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Palaeoproterozoic Aravalli Supergroup in Salumber region includes a basal unit of metabasic volcanic rocks (Salumber volcanic rocks) overlain by a volcaniclastic/conglomerate one. Although these volcanic rocks have been metamorphosed to green-schist facies, some primary volcanic features are still preserved. This metabasic volcanic sequence can be further differentiated on the basis of textural variations, and the mineral assemblages are: (a) oligoclase + actinolite + chlorite + epidote; and (b) oligoclase + hornblende+ chlorite + biotite + Fe-Ti oxides. The SiO<sub>2</sub> content ranges from ∼47.7 to 55.8% and MgO from ∼4.2 to 12.8%. Geochemical characteristics allow their subdivision into high Mg and Fe tholeiites. Inverse relationship of MgO with silica, alkalis and Zr is generally consistent with fractionation mechanism, also suggested by a change in colour of the rocks from dark greenish to light greenish towards the upper parts of the sequence. These metabasic volcanic rocks are enriched in incompatible trace elements and LREE (La = 30 − 40 &#215; chondrite, Lu = 2 − 5 &#215; chondrite), and demonstrate affinity mainly with MORB and within plate settings in geochemical tectonic discrimination schemes. The geochemical characteristics suggest a complex evolutionary history envisaging derivation of the melt from an enriched heterogeneous lithospheric source.</p>

				<title>Origin of Cretaceous phosphorites from the onshore of Tamil Nadu, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0525-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cretaceous phosphorites from the onshore of Tamil Nadu have been investigated for their origin and compared with those in the offshore. Cretaceous phosphorites occur as light brown to yellowish brown or white nodules in Karai Shale of the Uttatur Group in the onshore Cauvery basin. Nodules exhibit phosphatic nucleus encrusted by a chalky shell of carbonate. The nucleus of the nodules consists of light and dark coloured laminae, phosphate peloids/coated grains and detrital particles interspersed between the laminae. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies reveal trapping and binding activity of microbial filaments. A mat structure with linearly arranged microbial filaments and hollow, cell-based coccoid cyanobacterial mat are present. Nodules contain abundant carbonate fluorapatite, followed by minor calcite, quartz and feldspar. The P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> content of the phosphorites ranges from 18 to 26%. The CaO/P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Sr and F contents are higher than that of pure carbonate fluorapatite. Concentrations of Si, Al, K, Fe, and Ti are low. We suggest that the nuclei of the nodules represent phosphate clasts related to phosphate stromatolites formed at intertidal conditions. At high energy levels the microbial mats were disintegrated into phosphate clasts, coated with carbonate and then reworked into Karai Shale. On the other hand, Quaternary phosphorites occur as irregular to rounded, grey coloured phosphate clasts at water depths between 180 and 320m on the continental shelf of Tamil Nadu. They exhibit grain-supported texture. Despite Quaternary in age, they also resemble phosphate stromatolites of intertidal origin and reworked as phosphate clasts onto the shelf margin depressions. Benthic microbial mats probably supplied high phosphorus to the sediments. Availability of excess phosphorus seems to be a pre-requisite for the formation of phosphate stromatolites.</p>

				<title>Effect of initial stress on reflection at the free surface of anisotropic elastic medium</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0537-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The propagation of plane waves is considered in a general anisotropic elastic medium in the presence of initial stress. The Christoffel equations are solved into a polynomial of degree six. The roots of this polynomial represent the vertical slowness values for the six quasi-waves resulting from the presence of a discontinuity in the medium. Three of these six values are identified with the three quasi-waves traveling in the medium but away from its boundary. Reflection at the free plane surface is studied for partition of energy among the three reflected waves. For post-critical incidence, the reflected waves are inhomogeneous (evanescent) waves. Numerical examples are considered to exhibit the effects of initial stress on the phase direction, attenuation and reflection coefficients of the reflected waves. The phase velocities and energy shares of the reflected waves change significantly with initial stress as well as anisotropic symmetry. The presence of initial stress, however, has a negligible effect on the phase directions of reflected waves.</p>

				<title>Features of discrete VLF emissions observed at Gulmarg, India during the magnetic storm of 6–7 March, 1986</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0553-0559</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the analysis of archived VLF data from Indian low latitude ground stations, some discrete VLF emissions recorded at the low latitude ground station Gulmarg (geomagnetic latitude 24&#176;26&#8242;N; geomagnetic longitude 147&#176; 09&#8242;E, L = 1.28) during moderate magnetic storm activity (𝛴 $K^{−}_{P}} = 32$, $K_P$ index varies from 4 to 6 during the observation period) on 6/7 March,  1986 are presented in this paper. The dynamic spectra of these discrete VLF emissions were observed along with tweeks and its harmonics, which is interesting and complex to explain. In most of the events the harmonic frequency of tweeks correlates with the starting frequency of harmonics of discrete emissions. In order to explain the observed features of discrete VLF emissions, we propose cyclotron resonance interaction between whistler mode wave and energetic electrons of inner radiation belt as possible generation mechanism. An attempt is also made to determine parallel energy, anisotropy and wave growth relevant to the generation process of VLF emissions.</p>

				<title>Detecting areal changes in tidal flats after sea dike construction using Landsat-TM images</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0561-0573</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main objective of this study was to estimate changes in the area of tidal flats that occurred after sea dike construction on the western coast of South Korea using Landsat-TM images. Applying the ISODATA method of unsupervised classification for Landsat-TM images, the tidal flats were identified, and the resulting areas were quantified for each image. The area of tidal flats from a topographic map published in one year differs significantly from that shown in another, which appears to be attributable to the tide levels at the time of aerial photography. During the study period, the area of tidal flats, as estimated from Landsat-TM images, increased by 4.57 km<sup>2</sup> per year in the study areas. The tidal flats in the inner sea of Chunsu Harbor area increased by 200m<sup>2</sup> per zone, while the accumulation for a number of inner sea areas within Asan Harbor area occurred at over 50m<sup>2</sup> per zone. The results of this research may serve as the basis of an environmentallyfriendly development plan for tidal flats.</p>

				<title>FT-IR and XRD analysis of coal from Makum coalfield of Assam</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0575-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High sulphur coal sample from Ledo colliery of Makum coalfield, Assam, India was studied using FT-IR and XRD methods. FT-IR study shows the presence of aliphatic –CH, $–CH_2$ and $–CH_3$ groups, aliphatic C–O–C stretching associated with –OH and –NH stretching vibrations and HCC rocking (single and condensed rings). XRD pattern of the coal shows that it is amorphous in nature. Function of Radial Distribution Analysis (FRDA) indicates that coal is lignite in type and there is no evidence of graphite-like structure. The first maximum in the G(𝑟) plot of FRDA at 𝑟 = 0.14 nm relates to the aliphatic C–C bond (Type C–CH=CH–C), the second maximum at 𝑟 = 0.25 nm relates to the distance between carbon atoms of aliphatic chains that are located across one carbon atom. The curve intensity profiles obtained from FRDA show quite regular molecular packets for this coal. The coal was found to be lignite in nature.</p>

				<title>Low-Ti melts from the southeastern Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province: Evidence for a water-rich mantle source?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (STLIP) is one of the most voluminous volcanic provinces on Earth. The dominant erupted rocks are low-Ti basalts, which make up 80% by volume of the classical Noril’sk lava sequence. In the west Siberian basin and Maymecha-Kotuy area, the low- Ti basalts make up about 99% and 50% by volume, respectively. Dolerite sills in the Angara– Taseevskaya Syncline at the southeastern STLIP exhibit trace element patterns and Sr isotope ratios typical of the low-Ti basalts of the Noril’sk sequence. The most Mg-rich (MgO  9.5–11 wt%) and hence least differentiated dolerites are characterized by trace element patterns with Ta-Nb depletion, low Ce/Pb and high Sr/Pr. These trace element features are similar to water-saturated, mantle wedge-derived island arc basalts. These imply an important role of subduction fluid-derived trace elements in the source of melting beneath the Angara–Taseevskaya Syncline and other regions of the STLIP. Less magnesium rocks (MgO 3.8–6.1 wt%) with less prominent Ta-Nb depletion, higher Ce/Pb and lower Sr/Pr could be produced via olivine-plagioclase fractionation of primary high-magnesium melts.</p>

				<title>The initiation and linkage of surface fractures above a buried strike-slip fault: An experimental approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0023-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface fractures in the overburdened sedimentary rocks, formed above a deep-seated basement fault, often provide important information about the kinematics of the underlying master fault. It has already been established that these surface fractures dynamically evolve and link one another with progressive displacement on the master fault below. In the present study, two different series of riedel-type experiments were carried out with clay analogue models under different boundary conditions viz., (i) heterogeneous simple shear of the cover rocks above a buried strike slip fault (wrench system) and (ii) heterogeneous simple shear with a component of shear-normal compression of the overburden package above a basement fault (transpressional system), to observe the initiation and linkage of surface fractures with varying $T^\prime$ (where $T^\prime$ = thickness of the overburden normalized with respect to the width of the master fault). In the wrench system, Riedel (R) shears were linked by principal displacement (Y) shears at early stages (shear strain of 0.8 to 1) in thin (2 &gt; $T^\prime$ &gt; 18) models and finally (at a minimum shear strain of 1.4) gave rise to a through-going fault parallel to the basement fault without development of any other fracture. Conjugate Riedel (R&#8242;) shears develop only within the thicker ($T^\prime$ &lt; 18) clay models at a minimum shear strain of 0.7. With increasing deformation (at a minimum shear strain of 1.2) two R&#8242; shears were joined by an R shear and finally opened up to make a sigmoidal vein with an asymmetry antithetic to the major faultmovement sense. Under transpression, the results were similar to that of heterogeneous simple shear for layers 2 &gt; $T^\prime$ &gt; 15. In layers of intermediate thickness (15 &gt; $T^\prime$ &gt; 25) early formed high angle R shears were cross cut by low angle R shears (at a minimum shear strain of 0.5 and shortening of 0.028) and “Riedel-within-Riedel” shears were formed within thick ($T^\prime$ &lt; 25) models (at minimum shear strain of 0.7 and shortening of 0.1), with marked angularity of secondary fault zone with the master fault at depth.</p>

				<title>Application of GPR in the study of shallow subsurface sedimentary architecture of Modwa spit, Gulf of Kachchh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0033-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coastline constitutes a very sensitive geomorphic domain constantly subjected to dynamic coastal processes. The study of its ever-changing physiography and stratigraphy provides a wealth of information on its history and evolution, in many cases at decadal and annual scales. The present study was carried out on the Modwa beach complex between Rawal Pir and Modwa, about 10 km east of Mandvi on the northern coast of the Gulf of Kachchh. The Modwa spit is a 7-km long WNW-ESE trending prograding amalgamated beach ridge complex that is about 0.5 km wide at its western end and 1.5 km wide at its eastern end. This Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey delineated a variety of the radar surfaces and radar facies which reflects not only large scale sedimentary architecture, but depositional facies of the beach ridge complex. These are bounding surfaces separating the radar facies outline beach ridge (br), washover (wo), coastal dune (cd) and swale (sw) depositional environments. The internal sedimentary structures like tangential, parallel, concave and convex upward stratifications could also be visualized from the GPR profiles. The architecture suggests the formation of this complex due to a combined process of eastward littoral drift of locally derived sediments and its onshore deposition by storms and eolian activities.</p>

					<p>This communication reports the occurrence of an ash layer intercalated within the late Quaternary alluvial succession of the Madhumati River, a tributary of the lower Narmada River. Petrographic, morphological and chemical details of glass shards and pumice fragments have formed the basis of this study. The ash has been correlated with the Youngest Toba Tuff. The finding of ash layer interbedded in Quaternary alluvial sequences of western Indian continental margin is significant, as ash being datable material, a near precise time-controlled stratigraphy can be interpreted for the Quaternary sediments of western India. The distant volcanic source of this ash requires a fresh re-assessment of ash volume and palaeoclimatic interpretations.</p>

				<title>Identification of major sources controlling groundwater chemistry from a hard rockterrain – A case study from Mettur taluk, Salem district, Tamil Nadu, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0049-0058</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study area Mettur forms an important industrial town situated NW of Salem district. The geology of the area is mainly composed of Archean crystalline metamorphic complexes. To identify the major process activated for controlling the groundwater chemistry an attempt has been made by collecting a total of 46 groundwater samples for two different seasons, viz., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. The groundwater chemistry is dominated by silicate weathering and (Na + Mg) and (Cl + SO<sub>4</sub>) accounts of about 90% of cations and anions. The contribution of (Ca +Mg) and (Na + K) to total cations and HCO<sub>3</sub> indicates the domination of silicate weathering as major sources for cations. The plot for Na to Cl indicates higher Cl in both seasons, derived from Anthropogenic (human) sources from fertilizer, road salt, human and animal waste, and industrial applications, minor representations of Na also indicates source from weathering of silicate-bearing minerals. The plot for Na/Cl to EC indicates Na released from silicate weathering process which is also supported by higher HCO<sub>3</sub> values in both the seasons. Ion exchange process is also activated in the study area which is indicated by shifting to right in plot for Ca +Mg to SO<sub>4</sub> + HCO<sub>3</sub>. The plot of Na − Cl to Ca +Mg − HCO<sub>3</sub> − SO<sub>4</sub> confirms that Ca, Mg and Na concentrations in groundwater are derived from aquifer materials. Thermodynamic plot indicates that groundwater is in equilibrium with kaolinite, muscovite and chlorite minerals. Saturation index of silicate and carbonate minerals indicate oversaturation during pre-monsoon and undersaturation during post-monsoon, conforming dissolution and dilution process. In general, water chemistry is guided by complex weathering process, ion exchange along with influence of Cl ions from anthropogenic impact.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of karstic aquifers contribution to streams by the statistical analysis of recession curves</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0059-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Karstic aquifers significantly contribute to streams in most of Turkey’s river basins, so studies on karst water resources have great importance for Turkey. Karstic aquifer contributions are generally emerging at several locations near the river bed and are not readily measured by direct hydrometric methods. In this study, the extent of karstic aquifer contributions to a stream will be investigated by the statistical analysis of recession coefficients of recession curves. Six stream gauging stations on different streams in the western Mediterranean region of Turkey are selected. Recession periods of the streams are simulated by exponential and quadratic recession curve models. Recession coefficient series of the stream gauging stations are statistically investigated. The comparison of various statistical parameters shows that the recession coefficient series are fairly related to the karstic aquifer contributions. Especially, the measure of spread parameters, standard deviation and interquartile range of recession coefficient series are related to the extent of the karstic aquifer contributions to streams.</p>

				<title>Implications of Kali–Hindon inter-stream aquifer water balance for groundwater management in western Uttar Pradesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0069-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kali–Hindon inter-stream region extends over an area of 395 km<sup>2</sup> within the Ganga–Yamuna interfluve. It is a fertile tract for sugarcane cultivation. Groundwater is a primary resource for irrigation and industrial purposes. In recent years, over-exploitation has resulted in an adverse impact on the groundwater regime. In this study, an attempt has been made to calculate a water balance for the Kali–Hindon inter-stream region. Various inflows and outflows to and from the aquifer have been calculated. The recharge due to rainfall and other recharge parameters such as horizontal inflow, irrigation return flow and canal seepage were also evaluated. Groundwater withdrawals, evaporation from the water table, discharge from the aquifer to rivers and horizontal subsurface outflows were also estimated. The results show that total recharge into the system is 148.72million cubic metres (Mcum), whereas the total discharge is 161.06 Mcum, leaving a deficit balance of −12.34Mcum. Similarly, the groundwater balance was evaluated for the successive four years. The result shows that the groundwater balance is highly sensitive to variation in rainfall followed by draft through pumpage. The depths to water level are shallow in the canal-irrigated northern part of the basin and deeper in the southern part. The pre-monsoon and post-monsoon water levels range from 4.6 to 17.7m below ground level (bgl) and from 3.5 to 16.5m bgl respectively. It is concluded that the groundwater may be pumped in the canal-irrigated northern part, while withdrawals may be restricted to the southern portion of the basin, where intense abstraction has led to rapidly falling water table levels.</p>

				<title>Low level of stratospheric ozone near the Jharia coal field in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0079-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian reserve of coking coal is mainly located in the Jharia coal field in Jharkhand. Although air pollution due to oxides and dioxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur is reported to have increased in this area due to large-scale opencast mining and coal fires, no significant study on the possible impact of coal fires on the stratospheric ozone concentration has been reported so far. The possible impact of coal fires, which have been burning for more than 90 years on the current stratospheric ozone concentration has been investigated using satellite based data obtained from Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS MLS), Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder (EOS MLS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) in this paper. The stratospheric ozone values for the years 1992–2007, in the 28–36 km altitude range near Jharia and places to its north are found to be consistently lower than those of places lying to its south (up to a radius of 1000 km around Jharia) by 4.0–20%. This low stratospheric ozone level around Jharia is being observed and reported for the first time. However, due to lack of systematic ground-based measurements of tropospheric ozone and vertical ozone profiles at Jharia and other far off places in different directions, it is difficult to conclude strongly on the existence of a relationship between pollution from coal fires and stratospheric ozone depletion.</p>

				<title>Impact of aerosols from the Asian Continent on the adjoining oceanic environments</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0083-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 630nm wavelength over the oceanic regions adjoining the Asian Continent is examined using a seven-year long data base derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board NOAA satellite to study the mean spatial and temporal variations as well as to understand the impact of aerosols advecting from the continent. Depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions and nature of synoptic circulation, the AOD over the oceanic region shows a systematic annual variation. This annual pattern inturn also shows an inter-annual variability because of the corresponding variations in the meteorological features over the continent as well as small-scale deviations in the nature of synoptic circulation. The annual variation over the oceanic regions also shows a pronounced spatial heterogeneity depending on the influence of continental aerosols. Making use of the wind speed dependence of sea-salt AOD at far-oceanic environments and monthly mean wind speeds at small grids of size 5&#176; &#215; 5&#176;, the annual variation of sea-salt AOD at different locations is studied to understand the spatial heterogeneity of this component. The residual component obtained by subtracting this from the measured AOD is the non-oceanic component due to advection from continent. The source regions for major continental advections are delineated from the analysis of air-mass back trajectories at appropriate locations identified from the annual pattern of non-oceanic component. The long-term effect of the continental impact is examined from the mean trend of AOD over the three major oceanic regions. This study shows that the continental influence is most significant over the Arabian Sea, followed by the Bay of Bengal and is almost insignificant in most of the regions over the Southern Hemispheric Indian Ocean, except for the effect of smoke aerosols over a few locations near Indonesia and Madagascar.</p>

				<title>Finite element modelling of elastic intraplate stresses due to heterogeneities in crustal density and mechanical properties for the Jabalpur earthquake region, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0103-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deep lower crustal intraplate earthquakes are infrequent and the mechanism of their occurrence is not well understood. The Narmada–Son-lineament region in central India has experienced two such events, the 1938 Satpura earthquake and the 1997 Jabalpur earthquake, having a focal depth of more than 35 km. We have estimated elastic stresses due to the crustal density and mechanical properties heterogeneities along the Hirapur–Mandla profile passing through the Jabalpur earthquake region to analyse conditions suitable for the concentration of shear stresses in the hypocentral region of this earthquake. Elastic stresses have been computed by a finite element method for a range of material parameters. The results indicate that the shear stresses generated by the density heterogeneities alone are not able to locally enhance the stress concentration in the hypocentral region. The role of mechanical properties of various crustal layers is important in achieving this localization of stresses. Among a range of material parameters analysed, the model with a mechanically strong lower crust overlying a relatively weak sub-Moho layer is able to enhance the stress concentration in the hypocentral region, implying a weaker mantle in comparison to the lower crust for this region of central India.</p>

				<title>Relationship between chemical composition and magnetic susceptibility in sediment   cores from Central Indian Ocean Basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0113-0119</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three sediment cores in a north–south transect (3&#176;N to 13&#176;S) from different sediment types of the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) are studied to understand the possible relationship between magnetic susceptibility (𝜒) and Al, Fe, Ti and Mn concentrations. The calcareous ooze core exhibit lowest 𝜒 (12.32 &#215; 10<sup>-7</sup>m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>), Al (2.84%), Fe (1.63%) and Ti (0.14%), terrigenous clay core with moderate 𝜒 (29.9 &#215; 10<sup>-7</sup> m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>) but highest Al (6.84%), Fe (5.20%) and Ti (0.44%), and siliceous ooze core with highest 𝜒 (38.06 &#215; 10<sup>-7</sup> m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>) but moderate Al (4.49%), Fe (2.80%) and Ti (0.19%) contents. The distribution of 𝜒 and detrital proxy elements (Al, Fe, and Ti)  are identical in both calcareous and siliceous ooze. Interestingly, in terrigenous core, the behaviour of 𝜒 is identical to only Ti content but not with Al and Fe suggesting possibility of Al and Fe having a non-detrital source.</p>
					<p>The occurrence of phillipsite in terrigenous clay is evident by the Al-K scatter plot where trend line intersects K axis at more than 50% of total K suggesting excess K in the form of phillipsite. Therefore, the presence of phillipsite might be responsible for negative correlation between 𝜒 and Al (𝑟 = −0.52). In siliceous ooze the strong positive correlations among 𝜒, Alexc and Feexc suggest the presence of authigenic Fe-rich smectite. High Mn content (0.5%) probably in the form of manganese micronodules is also contributing to 𝜒 in both calcareous and siliceous ooze but not in the terrigenous core where mean Mn content (0.1%) is similar to crustal abundance. Thus, 𝜒 systematically records the terrigenous variation in both the biogenic sediments but in terrigenous clay it indirectly suggests the presence of authigenic minerals.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of coal bed methane potential of coal seams of Sawang Colliery, Jharkhand, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0121-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coal seams of Sawang Colliery, East Bokaro Coalfields are bituminous to sub-bituminous in nature and categorized as high gaseous seams (degree II to degree III level). These seams have the potential for coal bed methane (CBM) and their maturity increases with increasing depth, as a result of enhanced pressure-temperature conditions in the underground. The vitrinite maceral group composition of the investigated coal seams ranges from 62.50-83.15%, whereas the inertinite content varies from 14.93-36.81%. The liptinite content varies from 0.66% to 3.09%. The maximum micro-pores are confined within the vitrinite group of macerals. The coal seams exhibit vitrinite reflectance values (Ro% calculated) from 0.94% (sample CG-97) to 1.21% (sample CG-119).</p>
					<p>Proximate analyses of the investigated coal samples reveal that the moisture content (M%) ranges from 1.28% to 2.98%, whereas, volatile matter (VM%) content is placed in the range of  27.01% to 33.86%. The ash content (A%) ranges from 10.92% to 30.01%. Fixed carbon (FC%) content varies from 41.53% to 55.93%. Fuel ratio variation shows a restricted range from 1.53 to 1.97. All the coal samples were found to be strongly caking and forming coke buttons.</p>
					<p>The present study is based on the adsorption isotherm experiments carried out under controlled <i>P-T</i> conditions for determination of actual gas adsorption capacity of the coal seams. This analysis shows that the maximum methane gas adsorbed in the coal sample CG-81 is 17m3/t (Std. daf), at maximum pressure of 5.92MPa and experimental temperature of 30&#176;C. The calculated Langmuir regression parameters $P_L$ and $V_L$ range from 2.49 to 3.75MPa and 22.94 to 26.88m3/t (Std. daf), respectively.</p>

				<title>Integrated approach for identification of potential groundwater zones in Seethanagaram Mandal of Vizianagaram District, Andhra Pradesh, India</title>

				<page>0133-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Identifying a good site for groundwater exploration in hard rock terrain is a challenging task. In hard rocks, groundwater occurs in secondary porosity developed due to weathering, fracturing, faulting, etc., which is highly variable within short distance and contributing to near-surface inhomogeneity. In such situations topographic, hydrogeological and geomorphological features provide useful clues for the selection of suitable sites.</p>
					<p>Initially, based on satellite imagery, topographical, geomorphological and hydrogeological features, an area of about 149km<sup>2</sup> was demarcated as a promising zone for groundwater exploration in the hard rock tract of Seethanagaram Mandal, Vizianagaram District, Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 50 Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) were carried out using Wenner electrode configuration. An interactive interpretation of the VES data sharpened the information inferred from  geomorphological and hydrogeological reconnaissance. Ten sites were recommended for drilling. Drilling with Down-The-Hole Hammer (DTH) was carried out at the recommended sites down to 50 to 70m depths. The interpreted VES results matched well with the drilled bore well lithologs. The yields of bore wells vary from 900 to 9000 liters per hour (lph).</p>

				<title>An application of artificial intelligence for rainfall–runoff modeling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0145-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study proposes an application of two techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) for rainfall–runoff modeling: the artificial neural networks (ANN) and the evolutionary computation (EC). Two different ANN techniques, the feed forward back propagation (FFBP) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) methods are compared with one EC method, Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which is a new evolutionary algorithm that evolves computer programs. The daily hydrometeorological data of three rainfall stations and one streamflow station for Juniata River Basin in Pennsylvania state of USA are taken into consideration in the model development. Statistical parameters such as average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, minimum and maximum values, as well as criteria such as mean square error (MSE) and determination coefficient $(R^2)$ are used to measure the performance of the models. The results indicate that the proposed genetic programming (GP) formulation performs quite well compared to results obtained by ANNs and is quite practical for use. It is concluded from the results that GEP can be proposed as an alternative to ANN models.</p>

				<title>A Statistical Cyclone Intensity Prediction (SCIP) model for the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0157-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A statistical model for predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal has been proposed. The model is developed applying multiple linear regression technique. The model parameters are determined from the database of 62 cyclones that developed over the Bay of Bengal during the period 1981–2000. The parameters selected as predictors are: initial storm intensity, intensity changes during past 12 hours, storm motion speed, initial storm latitude position, vertical wind shear averaged along the storm track, vorticity at 850 hPa, Divergence at 200 hPa and sea surface temperature (SST). When the model is tested with the dependent samples of 62 cyclones, the forecast skill of the model for forecasts up to 72 hours is found to be reasonably good. The average absolute errors (AAE) are less than 10 knots for forecasts up to 36 hours and maximum forecast error of order 14 knots occurs at 60 hours and 72 hours. When the model is tested with the independent samples of 15 cyclones (during 2000 to 2007), the AAE is found to be less than 13 knots (ranging from 5.1 to 12.5 knots) for forecast up to 72 hours. The model is found to be superior to the empirical model proposed by Roy Bhowmik et al (2007) for the Bay of Bengal.</p>

				<title>North Indian Ocean warming and sea level rise in an OGCM</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0169-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variability in the long-term temperature and sea level over the north Indian Ocean during the period 1958–2000 has been investigated using an Ocean General Circulation Model, Modular Ocean Model version 4. The model simulated fields are compared with the sea level observations from tide-gauges, Topex/Poseidon (T/P) satellite, <i>in situ</i> temperature profile observations from WHOI moored buoy and sea surface temperature (SST) observations from DS1, DS3 and DS4 moored buoys. It is seen that the long (6–8 years) warming episodes in the SST over the north Indian Ocean are followed by short episodes (2–3 years) of cooling. The model temperature and sea level anomaly over the north Indian Ocean show an increasing trend in the study period. The model thermocline heat content per unit area shows a linear increasing trend (from 1958–2000) at the rate of 0.0018 &#215; 10<sup>11</sup>J/m<sup>2</sup> per year for north Indian Ocean. North Indian Ocean sea level anomaly (thermosteric component) also shows a linear increasing trend of 0.31mm/year during 1958–2000.</p>

				<title>Active fault traces along Bhuj Fault and Katrol Hill Fault, and trenching survey at Wandhay, Kachchh, Gujarat, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0181-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several new active fault traces were identiﬁed along Katrol Hill Fault (KHF).A new fault (named as Bhuj Fault,BF)that extends into the Bhuj Plain was also identiﬁed.These fault traces were identiﬁed based on satellite photo interpretation and ﬁeld survey.Trenches were excavated to identify the paleoseismic events,pattern of faulting and the nature of deformation.New active fault traces were recognized about 1 km north of the topographic boundary between the Katrol Hill and the plain area.The fault exposure along the left bank of Khari River with 10 m wide shear zone in the Mesozoic rocks and showing displacement of the overlying Quaternary deposits is indicative of continued tectonic activity along the ancient fault.The E-W trending active fault traces along the KHF in the western part changes to NE-SW or ENE-WSW near Wandhay village.</p>
					<p>Trenching survey across a low scarp near Wandhay village reveals three major fault strands F1, F2,and F3.These fault strands displaced the older terrace deposits comprising Sand,Silt and Gravel units along with overlying younger deposits from units 1 to 5 made of gravel,sand and silt.  Stratigraphic relationship indicates at least three large magnitude earthquakes along KHF during Late Holocene or recent historic past.</p>

				<title>Magnetotelluric investigations for imaging electrical structure of Garhwal Himalayan corridor, Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0189-0200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Magnetotelluric investigations have been carried out in the Garhwal Himalayan corridor to delineate the electrical structure of the crust along a proﬁle extending from Indo-Gangetic Plain to Higher Himalayan region in Uttarakhand,India.The proﬁle passing through major Himalayan thrusts:Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFF),Main Boundary Thrust (MBT)and Main Central Thrust (MCT),is nearly perpendicular to the regional geological strike.Data processing and impedance analysis indicate that out of 44 stations MT data recorded,only 27 stations data show in general,the validity of 2D assumption.The average geoelectric strike, N70&#176;W, was estimated for the proﬁle using tensor decomposition.2D smooth geoelectrical model has been presented,which provides the electrical image of the shallow and deeper crustal structure.The major features of the model are (i)a low resistivity (&gt; 50𝛺 m),shallow feature interpreted as sediments of Siwalik and Indo-Gangetic Plain,(ii)highly resistive (&lt; 1000 𝛺m)zone below the sediments at a depth of 6 km,interpreted as the top surface of the Indian plate,(iii)a low resistivity (&gt; 10𝛺 m) below the depth of 6 km near MCT zone coincides with the intense micro-seismic activity in the region. The zone is interpreted as the partial melting or ﬂuid phase at mid crustal depth.Sensitivity test indicates that the major features of the geoelectrical model are relevant and desired by the MT data.</p>

				<title>Paleosol at the Archean–Proterozoic contact in NW India revisited – Evidence for oxidizing conditions during paleo-weathering?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0201-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of ﬁne-grained sericite bearing pelitic,schistose lithologies occur along the Archean (Banded Gneiss Complex)–Proterozoic  (Aravalli Supergroup)contact (APC)in the Udaipur valley in NW Indian craton.These Al-rich lithologies (subsequently metamorphosed)have been described as ‘paleosols ’,developed over a 3.3 Ga old Archean gneissic basement and are overlain by Paleopro- terozoic Aravalli quartzite.The paleosol was developed between 2.5 and 2.1,coincident with the globally recognized Great Oxidation Event (GOE).In previous studies these paleosol sections were interpreted to have developed under reducing environment,however,the ﬁnding of a ‘ferricrete ’ zone in the upper part of Tulsi Namla section (east of Udaipur)during the present study (in addition to earlier reported lithologies) has  led to an alternative suggestion of oxygen-rich conditions during paleosol development.The Tulsi Namla paleosol section shows all the features characteristic of a complete paleosol section described from other Archean cratons.The paleosol includes sericite schist with kyanite as the prevalent Al-silicate in the lower part of proﬁle while chloritoid and Fe-oxides typify the Fe-rich upper part.Alumina has remained immobile during the weathering process while Fe and Mn show a decrease in the lower part of the section and an abrupt rise in the upper part,in the ferricrete zone.The ﬁeld and geochemical data indicate that the Tulsi Namla section is an <i>in situ</i> weathering proﬁle and at least the upper part shows evidence of oxidizing conditions.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variation in biomass and species composition of seaweeds stranded along Port Okha, northwest coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0211-0218</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Port Okha coast,which is known for its luxuriant growth of a diverse assemblage of seaweeds on Saurashtra coast,is found to have abundant quantities of seaweeds being drifted and washed ashore every year.Studies conducted for quantifying the stranded seaweeds from May 2004 to April 2005 showed an average biomass value of 3.10 kg fresh wt/m<sup>2</sup>/month with maximum being 6.60 kg fresh wt/m<sup>2</sup> in April.The stranded weeds constituted a total of 62 species during the entire study period.Of this,Rhodophyta ranked high with 26 species followed by Chlorophyta with 22 species and Phaeophyta with 14 species.The stranded seaweeds that were washed ashore provide valuable ﬂoristic information about the intertidal and near shore sub-tidal algae of the respective regions.Although natural senescence of seaweeds is one of the major factors,strong currents primarily forced by tides,also contribute to the uprooting and subsequent drifting of seaweeds on to the beach.This ultimately causes changes in ﬂoristic features of the existing algal beds.</p>

				<title>Observations of unusual whistlers during daytime at Jammu</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0219-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper,we report observations of unusual whistlers recorded at Jammu (geomag.lat.= 22&#176; 26&#8242;N; 𝐿 =1.17), India on March 8, 1999 during the daytime. They are interpreted as one-hop ducted whistlers having propagated along higher 𝐿 -values in closely spaced narrow ducts from the opposite hemispheres. After leakage from the duct, the waves might have propagated in the earthionosphere waveguide towards the equator in surface mode.Tentative explanation of the dynamic spectra of these events is brieﬂy presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The inﬂuence of temperature on tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)concentrations in urban and photochemically polluted areas in the greater Athens region are investigated in the present study.Hourly values of the ambient air temperature used for studying the urban heat island effect in Athens were recorded at twenty-three experimental stations while ozone concentration values were measured at three of the above-mentioned stations and for a period of two years (1996 –1997).The linear correlation between ozone concentration and air temperature values as well as the temporal variation of temperature and ozone concentration,for the above-mentioned experimental stations, were calculated and analysed.Moreover,a neural network approach was used for investigating the impact of temperature on the ozone concentration values over the greater Athens area.The neural network model used ambient air temperature as one of its input parameters and it was found that temperature is a predominant parameter,affecting considerably the ozone concentration values.</p>

				<title>A note on India’s water budget and evapotranspiration</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0237-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Some recent analyses of India ’s water budget are based on information attributed to the Ministry of Water Resources.An examination of the budget components indicates that they imply an evapotranspiration estimate that is signiﬁcantly lower than what one may expect based on information from other sources.If such is the case,India ’s water resources situation may be more dire than is otherwise perceived.For,higher evapotranspiration implies correspondingly reduced availability of water for human use.It should be worthwhile to investigate and reconcile the apparent discrepancy between water budget and evapotranspiration,considering the importance of water in the national context.</p>

				<title>Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB): An overview</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0243-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During March–May 2006, an extensive, multi-institution, multi-instrument, and multi-platform integrated field experiment ‘Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget’ (ICARB) was carried out under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO-GBP). The objective of this largest and most exhaustive field campaign, ever conducted in the Indian region, was to characterize the physico-chemical properties and radiative effects of atmospheric aerosols and trace gases over the Indian landmass and the adjoining oceanic regions of the Arabian Sea, northern Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal through intensive, simultaneous observations. A network of ground-based observatories (over the mainland and islands), a dedicated ship cruise over the oceanic regions using a fully equipped research vessel, the <i>Sagar Kanya</i>, and altitude profiling over selected regions using an instrumented aircraft and balloonsondes formed the three segments of this integrated experiment, which were carried out in tandem. This paper presents an overview of the ICARB field experiment, the database generated, and some of its interesting outcomes though these are preliminary in nature.</p>
					<p>The ICARB has revealed significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity in most of the aerosol characteristics both over land and ocean. Observed aerosol loading and optical depths were comparable to or in certain regions, a little lower than those reported in some of the earlier campaigns for these regions. The preliminary results indicate:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>low (&gt; 0.2) aerosol optical depths (AOD) over most part of the Arabian Sea, except two pockets; one off Mangalore and the other, less intense, in the central Arabian Sea at ∼18&#176; N latitude;</li>
						<li>High ˚Angström exponent in the southern Arabian Sea signifying steep AOD spectra and higher abundance of accumulation mode particles in the southern Arabian Sea and off Mangalore;</li>
						<li>Remarkably low ˚Angström exponents signifying increased concentration of coarse mode aerosols and high columnar abundance in the northern Arabian Sea;</li>
						<li>Altitude profiles from aircraft showed a steady BC level up to 3 km altitude with structures which were associated with inversions in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL);</li>
						<li>A surprisingly large increase in the BC mass fraction with altitude;</li>
						<li>Presence of a convectively mixed layer extending up to about 1 km over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal;</li>
						<li>A spatial off shore extent of &gt; 100 km for the anthropogenic impact at the coast; and</li>
						<li>Advection of aerosols, through airmass trajectories, from west Asia and NW arid regions of India leading to formation of elevated aerosol layers extending as far as 400 km off the east coast.</li>

				<title>Aircraft measurements of aerosol black carbon from a coastal location in the north-east part of peninsular India during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0263-0271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB) over India, high-resolution airborne measurements of the altitude profiles of the mass concentrations (M<sub>B</sub>) of aerosol black carbon (BC) were made off Bhubaneswar (BBR, 85.82&#176;E, 20.25&#176;N), over northwest Bay of Bengal, in the altitude region upto 3 km. Such high-resolution measurements of altitude profiles of aerosols are done for the first time over India. The profiles showed a near-steady vertical distribution of M<sub>B</sub> modulated with two small peaks, one at 800m and the other at ∼2000m. High resolution GPS (Global Positioning System) sonde (Vaisala) measurements around the same region onboard the research vessel <i>Sagar Kanya</i> (around the same time of the aircraft sortie) revealed two convectively well mixed layers, one from ground to ∼700m with an inversion at the top and the other extends from 1200m to ∼2000m with a second inversion at ∼2200m and a convectively stable region in the altitude range 700–1200m. The observed peaks in the M<sub>B</sub> profile are found to be associated with these temperature inversions. In addition, long-range transport from the Indo- Gangetic Plain (IGP) and deserts lying further to the west also influence the vertical profile of BC. Latitudinal variation of M<sub>B</sub> showed a remarkable land ocean contrast at the 500m altitude (within the well mixed region) with remarkably lower values over oceans, suggesting the impact of strong sources over the mainland. However, above the ABL (at 1500m), the latitudinal variations were quite weak, and this appears to be resulting from the impact of long-range transport. Comparison of the altitude profiles of M<sub>B</sub> over BoB off BBR with those obtained during the earlier occasion over the inland stations of Hyderabad and Kanpur showed similarities above ∼500m, with MB remaining around a steady value of ∼1 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup>. However, large differences are seen within the ABL. Even though the observed M<sub>B</sub> values are not unusually high, their near constancy in the vertical column will have important implications to radiative forcing.</p>

				<title>Airborne measurements of submicron aerosols across the coastline at Bhubaneswar during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Airborne measurements of the number concentration and size distribution of aerosols from 13 to 700 nm diameter have been made at four vertical levels across a coastline at Bhubaneswar (20&#176; 25&#8242;N, 85&#176; 83&#8242;E) during the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB) programme conducted in March–April 2006. The measurements made during the constant-level flights at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 km altitude levels extend ∼100 km over land and ∼150km over ocean. Aerosol number concentrations vary from 2200 to 4500 cm<sup>-3</sup> at 0.5 km level but are almost constant at ∼6000 cm<sup>-3</sup> and ∼800 cm<sup>-3</sup> at 2 and 3 km levels, respectively. At 1km level, aerosol number concentration shows a peak of 18,070 cm<sup>-3</sup> around the coastline. Most of the aerosol size distribution curves at 0.5 km and 1 km levels are monomodal with a maxima at 110nm diameter which shifts to 70 nm diameter at 2 and 3 km levels. However, at the peak at 1 km level, number concentration has a bimodal distribution with an additional maximum appearing in nucleation mode. It is proposed that this maxima in nucleation mode at 1 km level may be due to the formation and transport of new particles from coastal regions.</p>

				<title>Lidar observation of aerosol stratification in the lower troposphere over Pune during pre-monsoon season of 2006</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0293-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lidar observations of aerosol vertical distributions in the lower troposphere along with observations of horizontal and vertical winds from collocated UHF radar (Wind Profiler) over a tropical Indian station, Pune during the pre-monsoon season (March–May) of 2006 as part of an ISRO-GBP national campaign (ICARB) have been examined. Lidar vertical profiles showed high aerosol concentrations in the surface layers and a subsequent gradual decrease with height. Results showed the presence of an elevated stratified aerosol layer around 2000–3500m height which persisted throughout the months of March and April. Observed strong vertical gradients in both horizontal and vertical winds in the lower troposphere seem to be a possible cause for the formation of elevated aerosol layers. Further, high daytime temperatures accompanied by dry conditions at the surface help to enhance the aerosol loading in the lower layers over this location.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of spectral aerosol optical depths over India during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0303-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements, carried out regularly from a network of observatories spread over the Indian mainland and adjoining islands in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, are used to examine the spatio-temporal and spectral variations during the period of ICARB (March to May 2006). The AODs and the derived ˚Angström parameters showed considerable variations across India during the above period. While at the southern peninsular stations the AODs decreased towards May after a peak in April, in the north Indian regions they increased continuously from March to May. The ˚Angström coefficients suggested enhanced coarse mode loading in the north Indian regions, compared to southern India. Nevertheless, as months progressed from March to May, the dominance of coarse mode aerosols increased in the columnar aerosol size spectrum over the entire Indian mainland, maintaining the regional distinctiveness. Compared to the above, the island stations showed considerably low AODs, so too the northeastern station Dibrugarh, indicating the prevalence of cleaner environment. Long-range transport of aerosols from the adjoining regions leads to remarkable changes in the magnitude of the AODs and their wavelength dependencies during March to May. HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis shows that enhanced long-range transport of aerosols, particularly from the west Asia and northwest coastal India, contributed significantly to the enhancement of AOD and in the flattening of the spectra over entire regions; if it is the peninsular regions and the island Minicoy are more impacted in April, the north Indian regions including the Indo Gangetic Plain get affected the most during May, with the AODs soaring as high as 1.0 at 500 nm. Over the islands, the ˚Angström exponent (𝛼) remained significantly lower (∼1) over the Arabian Sea compared to Bay of Bengal (BoB) (∼1.4) as revealed by the data respectively from Minicoy and Port Blair. Occurrences of higher values of 𝛼, showing dominance of accumulation mode aerosols, over BoB are associated well with the advection, above the boundary layer, of fine particles from the east Asian region during March and April. The change in the airmass to marine in May results in a rapid decrease in 𝛼 over the BoB.</p>

				<title>Size segregated aerosol mass concentration measurements over the Arabian Sea during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0315-0323</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mass concentration and mass size distribution of total (composite) aerosols near the surface are essential inputs needed in developing aerosol models for radiative forcing estimation as well as to infer the environment and air quality. Using extensive measurements onboard the oceanographic research vessel, <i>Sagar Kanya</i>, during its cruise SK223B in the second phase of the ocean segment of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB), the spatial distribution of the mass concentration and mass size distribution of near-surface aerosols are examined for the first time over the entire Arabian Sea, going as far as 58&#176;E and 22&#176;N, within a span of 26 days. In general, the mass concentrations $(M_T)$ were found to be low with the mean value for the entire Arabian Sea being 16.7 ± 7 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup>; almost 1/2 of the values reported in some of the earlier campaigns. Coarse mode aerosols contributed, on an average, 58% to the  total mass, even though at a few pockets accumulation mode contribution dominated. Spatially, significant variations were observed over central and northern Arabian Sea as well as close to the west coast of India. In central Arabian Sea, even though the $M_T$ was quite low, contribution  of accumulation aerosols to the total mass concentration was greater than 50%. Effective radius, a parameter important in determining scattering properties of aerosol size distribution, varied between 0.07 and 0.4 𝜇 m with a mean value of 0.2 𝜇 m. Number size distributions, deduced from the mass size distributions, were approximated to inverse power-law form and the size indices (𝜐) were estimated. It was found to vary in the range 3.9 to 4.2 with a mean value of 4.0 for the entire oceanic region. Extinction coefficients, estimated using the number-size distributions, were well-correlated with the  accumulation mode mass concentration with a correlation coefficient of 0.82.</p>

				<title>Chemical characteristics of aerosols in MABL of Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during spring inter-monsoon: A comparative study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0325-0332</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemical composition of aerosols in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) of Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Arabian Sea (AS) has been studied during the spring and inter-monsoon (March–May 2006) based on the analysis of water soluble constituents (Na<sup>+</sup>, NH$^{+}_{4}$, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, $Cl^{−}$, NO$^{−}_{3}$ and SO$^{2−}_{4}$), crustal elements (Al, Fe, and Ca) and carbonaceous species (EC, OC). The total suspended particulates (TSP) ranged from 5.2 to 46.6 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup> and 8.2 to 46.9 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup> during the sampling transects in the BoB and AS respectively. The water-soluble species, on average, accounted for 44% and 33% of TSP over BoB and AS respectively, with dominant contribution of SO$^{2−}_{4}$ over both the oceanic regions. However, distinct differences with respect to elevated abundances of NH$^{+}_{4}$ in the MABL of BoB and that of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in AS are clearly evident. The non-sea-salt component of SO$^{2−}_{4}$ ranging from 82 to 98% over BoB and 35 to 98% over AS; together with $nss-Ca^{2+}/nss-SO^{2−}_{4}$ equivalent ratios 0.12 to 0.5 and 0.2 to 1.16, respectively, provide evidence for the predominance of anthropogenic constituents and chemical transformation processes occurring within MABL. The concentrations of OC and EC average around 1.9 and 0.4 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup> in BoB and exhibit a decreasing trend from north to south; however, abundance of these carbonaceous species are not significantly pronounced over AS. The abundance of Al, used as a proxy for mineral aerosols, varied from 0.2 to 1.9 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup> over BoB and AS, with a distinctly different spatial pattern – decreasing north to south in BoB in contrast to an increasing pattern in the Arabian Sea.</p>

				<title>Aerosol mass loading over the marine environment of Arabian Sea during ICARB: Sea-salt and non-sea-salt components</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0333-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mass loading and chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols over the Arabian Sea during the pre-monsoon months of April and May have been studied as a part of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB). These investigations show large spatial variabilities in total aerosol mass loading as well as that of individual chemical species. The mass loading is found to vary between 3.5 and 69.2 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup>, with higher loadings near the eastern and northern parts of Arabian Sea, which decreases steadily to reach its minimum value in the mid Arabian Sea. The decrease in mass loading from the coast of India towards west is estimated to have a linear gradient of 1.53 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup>/◦ longitude and an e−1 scale distance of ∼2300 km. SO$^{2−}_{4}$, Cl<sup>−</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> are found to be the major ionic species present. Apart from these, other dominating watersoluble components of aerosols are NO$^{−}_{3}$ (17%) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (6%). Over the marine environment of Arabian Sea, the non-sea-salt component dominates accounting to ∼76% of the total aerosol mass. The spatial variations of the various ions are examined in the light of prevailing meteorological conditions and airmass back trajectories.</p>

				<title>Chemical characteristics of $PM_{10} aerosols and airmass trajectories over Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0345-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the first time, chemical characterization of PM<sub>10</sub> aerosols was attempted over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Arabian Sea (AS) during the ICARB campaign. Dominance of SO$^{2−}_{4}$, NH$^{+}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ was noticed over both the regions which indicated the presence of ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate as major water soluble particles playing a very important role in the radiation budget. It was observed that all the chemical constituents had higher concentrations over Bay of Bengal as compared to Arabian Sea. Higher concentrations were observed near the Indian coast showing influence of landmass indicating that gaseous pollutants like SO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> are transported over to the sea regions which consequently contribute to higher SO$^{2−}_{4}$, NH$^{+}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ aerosols respectively. The most polluted region over BoB was 13&#176;-19&#176;N and 70&#176;-90&#176;E while it was near 11&#176;N and 75&#176;E over AS. Although the concentrations were higher over Bay of Bengal for all the chemical constituents of PM<sub>10</sub> aerosols, per cent non-sea salt (nss) fraction (with respect to Na) was higher over Arabian Sea. Very low Ca<sup>+2</sup> concentration was observed at Arabian Sea which led to higher atmospheric acidity as compared to BoB. Nss SO$^{2−}_{4}$ alone contributed 48% of total water soluble fraction over BoB as well as AS. Ratios SO$^{2−}_{4}$/NO$^{−}_{3}$ over both the regions (7.8 and 9 over BoB and AS respectively) were very high as compared to reported values at land sites like Allahabad (0.63) and Kanpur (0.66) which may be due to very low NO−3 over sea regions as compared to land sites. Air trajectory analysis showed four classes: (i) airmass passing through Indian land, (ii) from oceanic region, (iii) northern Arabian Sea and Middle East and (iv) African continent. The highest nss SO$^{2−}_{4}$ was observed during airmasses coming from the Indian land side while lowest concentrations were observed when the air was coming from oceanic regions. Moderate concentrations of nss SO$^{2−}_{4}$ were observed when air was seen moving from the Middle East and African continent. The pH of rainwater was observed to be in the range of 5.9–6.5 which is lower than the values reported over land sites. Similar feature was reported over the Indian Ocean during INDOEX indicating that marine atmosphere had more free acidity than land atmosphere.</p>

				<title>Influence of circulation parameters on the AOD variations over the Bay of Bengal during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0353-0360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) level-3 aerosol data, NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis winds and QuikSCAT ocean surface winds were made use of to examine the role of atmospheric circulation in governing aerosol variations over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the first phase of the ICARB (Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget) campaign (March 18–April 12, 2006). An inter-comparison between MODIS level-3 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and ship-borne MICROTOPS measurements showed good agreement with correlation 0.92 (𝑝 &gt; 0.0001) and a mean MODIS underestimation by 0.01. During the study period, the AOD over BoB showed high values in the northern/north western regions, which reduced towards the central and southern BoB. The wind patterns in lower atmospheric layers (&lt; 850 hPa)  indicated that direct transport of aerosols from central India was inhibited by the presence of a high pressure and a divergence over BoB in the lower altitudes. On the other hand, in the upper atmospheric levels, winds from central and northern India stretched south eastwards and converged over BoB with a negative vorticity indicative of a downdraft. These wind patterns pointed to the possibility of aerosol transport from central India to BoB by upper level winds. This mechanism was further confirmed by the significant correlations that AOD variations over BoB showed with aerosol flux convergence and flux vorticity at upper atmospheric levels (600–500 hPa). AOD in central and southern BoB away from continental influences displayed an exponential dependence on the QuikSCAT measured ocean surface wind speed. This study shows that particles transported from central and northern India by upper atmospheric circulations as well as the marine aerosols generated by ocean surface winds contributed to the AOD over the BoB during the first phase of ICARB.</p>

				<title>Analysis of marine aerosol optical depth retrieved from IRS-P4 OCM sensor and comparison with the aerosol derived from SeaWiFS and MODIS sensor</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0361-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol optical depth is regularly derived from SeaWiFS and MODIS sensor and used by the scientific community in various climatic studies. In the present study an attempt has been made to retrieve the aerosol optical depth using the IRS-P4 OCM sensor data and a comparison has been carried out using few representative datasets. The results show that the IRS-P4 OCM retrieved aerosol optical depth is in good agreement with the aerosols retrieved from SeaWiFS as well as MODIS. The RMSE are found to be ± 0.0522 between OCM and SeaWIFS and ± 0.0638 between OCM and MODIS respectively. However, IRS-P4 OCM sensor retrieved aerosol optical depth is closer to SeaWiFS (correlation = 0.88, slope = 0.96 and intercept = −0.013) compared to MODIS (correlation = 0.75, slope = 0.91 and intercept = 0.0198). The mean percentage difference indicates that OCM retrieved AOD is +12% higher compared to SeaWiFS and +8% higher compared to MODIS. The mean absolute percentage between OCM derived AOD and SeaWiFS is found to be less (16%) compared to OCM and MODIS (20%).</p>

				<title>Latitudinal and longitudinal variation in aerosol characteristics from Sun photometer and MODIS over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0375-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spatial variations in aerosol optical properties as function of latitude and longitude are analysed over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea during ICARB cruise period of March–May 2006 from <i>in situ</i> sun photometer and MODIS (Terra, Aqua) satellite measurements. Monthly mean 550 nm aerosol optical depths (AODs) over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea show an increase from March to May both in spatial extent and magnitude. AODs are found to increase with latitude from 4&#176;N to 20&#176;N over the Bay of Bengal while over Arabian Sea, variations are not significant. Sun photometer and MODIS AODs agree well within ± 1𝜎  variation. Bay of Bengal AOD (0.28) is higher than the Arabian Sea (0.24) latitudinally. Aerosol fine mode fraction (FMF) is higher than 0.6 over Bay of Bengal, while FMF in the Arabian Sea is about 0.5. Bay of Bengal 𝛼 (∼1) is higher than the Arabian Sea value of 0.7, suggesting the dominance of fine mode aerosols over Bay of Bengal which is corroborated by higher FMF values over Bay of Bengal. Air back trajectory analyses suggest that aerosols from different source regions contribute differently to the optical characteristics over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.</p>

				<title>Aerosol characteristics at a remote island: Minicoy in southern Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0389-0397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extensive measurements of aerosol optical and microphysical properties made at a remote island, Minicoy in southern Arabian Sea for the period (February 2006–March 2007) are used to characterize their temporal variability and Black Carbon (BC) mass mixing ratio. Large decrease in aerosol BC (from ∼800 ng m<sup>−3</sup> to ∼100 ng m<sup>−3</sup>) was observed associated with change in airmass characteristics and monsoon rains. The total aerosol mass varied between ∼80 and 20 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup>. Though the total mass fell drastically, a slight increase in super micron mass was observed during the June–August period associated with high winds. The mass fraction of Black Carbon aerosols during the prevalence of continental airmass is found to be ∼1.2% of the composite aerosols, which is much lower than the values reported earlier for this region.</p>

				<title>Physical and optical characteristics of atmospheric aerosols during ICARB at Manora Peak, Nainital: A sparsely inhabited, high-altitude location in the Himalayas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0399-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Collocated measurements of the optical and physical properties of columnar and near-surface aerosols were carried out from Manora Peak, Nainital (a sparsely inhabited, high altitude location, ∼2km above mean sea level, in the Himalayas), during the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB) under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO-GBP). Under this, observational data of spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD), mass concentration of aerosol black carbon (M<sub>B</sub>), mass concentration ($M_T$) and number concentration ($N_t$) of composite (total) aerosols near the surface and meteorological parameters were collected during the period February 15 to April 30, 2006. Though very low (&gt; 0.1 at 500 nm) AODs were observed during clear days, as much as a fourfold increase was seen on hazy days. The ˚Angström exponent (𝛼), deduced from the spectral AODs, revealed high values during clear days, while on hazy days 𝛼 was low; with an overall mean value of 0.69 ± 0.06 for the campaign period. BC mass concentration varied between 0.36 and 2.87 𝜇 g m<sup>−3</sup> and contributed in the range 0.7 to 1.8% to the total aerosol mass. Total aerosol number concentration and BC mass concentration showed diurnal variation with a midnight and early morning minimum and a late afternoon maximum; a pattern quite opposite to that seen in low altitude stations. These are attributed to the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The spectral AOD measurements have been made for the first time over Patiala during multiplatform field campaign ICARB–2006 using a Multi-Wavelength Radiometer (MWR) along with the suspended particulate matter measurements with a high volume sampler. Spectral AOD has higher values in May in comparison to March and April. The monthly mean AOD values at 500 nm are 0.26 ± 0.08, 0.36 ± 0.19 and 0.58 ± 0.20 for the months of March, April and May respectively. The mean AOD is more during afternoon in comparison to forenoon at all wavelengths. The atmospheric turbidity is higher in May and is attributed to dust transported by southerly winds prevailing during this month. The ˚Angström parameter 𝛼 varies between zero and 0.68 while 𝛽 ranges from 0.1 to 0.9. The columnar water vapour content ranges from 0.12 to 2.92 cm, having a mean value of 1.06 ± 0.648 cm. The mean total suspended particulate matter is 334.41 ± 97.56 𝜇 gm/m<sup>3</sup>, an indication of high aerosol loading over Patiala during the campaign period.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous and campaign-based aerosol field measurements are essential in understanding fundamental atmospheric aerosol processes and for evaluating their effect on global climate, environment and human life. Synchronous measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Black Carbon (BC) aerosol mass concentration and aerosol particle size distribution were carried out during the campaign period at tropical urban regions of Hyderabad, India. Daily satellite datasets of DMSP-OLS were processed for night-time forest fires over the Indian region in order to understand the additional sources (forest fires) of aerosol. The higher values in black carbon aerosol mass concentration and aerosol optical depth correlated well with forest fires occurring over the region. Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol index (AI) variations showed absorbing aerosols over the region and correlated with ground measurements.</p>

				<title>Temporal characteristics of aerosol physical properties at Visakhapatnam on the east coast of India during ICARB – Signatures of transport onto Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0421-0427</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Realizing the importance of aerosol physical properties at the adjoining continental and coastal locations in the airmass pathways onto the oceanic region, extensive measurements of aerosol physical properties were made at Visakhapatnam (17.7&#176;N, 83.3&#176;E), an eastern coastal location in peninsular India during the ICARB period. The temporal variations of aerosol optical depth, near surface aerosol mass size distributions and BC mass concentrations show significantly higher aerosol optical depth and near surface mass concentrations during the first and last weeks of April 2007. The mean BC mass fraction in the fine mode aerosol was around 11%. The aerosol back scatter profiles derived from Micro Pulse Lidar indicate a clear airmass subsidence on the days with higher aerosol optical depths and near surface mass fraction. A comparison of the temporal variation of the aerosol properties at Visakhapatnam with the MODIS derived aerosol optical depth along the cruise locations indicates a resemblance in the temporal variation suggesting that the aerosol transport from the eastern coastal regions of peninsular India could significantly affect the aerosol optical properties at the near coastal oceanic regions and that the affect significantly reduced at the farther regions.</p>

					<p>A physical-biological-chemical model (PBCM)is used for investigating the seasonal cycle of  air –sea carbon ﬂux and for assessing  the effect of the biological processes on seasonal time scale in the Arabian Sea (AS)and Bay of Bengal (BoB),where the surface waters are subjected to contrasting physical conditions.The formulation of PBCM is given in Swathi <i>et al</i> (2000),and evaluation of several ammonium-inhibited nitrate uptake models is given in Sharada <i>et al</i> (2005). The PBCM is here ﬁrst evaluated against JGOFS data on surface pCO<sub>2</sub> in AS, Bay of Bengal Process Studies (BoBPS)data on column integrated primary productivity in BoB,and WOCE I1 data on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)and alkalinity (ALK)in the upper 500 meters at 9&#176;N in AS and at 10&#176;N in BoB in September –October.There is good qualitative agreement with local quantitative discrepancies.</p>
					<p>The net effect of biological processes on air –sea carbon ﬂux on seasonal time scale is determined with an auxiliary computational experiment,called the abiotic run,in which the biological processes are turned off.The difference between the biotic run and abiotic run is interpreted as the net effect of biological processes on the seasonal variability of chemical variables.The net biological effect on air –sea carbon ﬂux is found to be highest in southwest monsoon season in the northwest AS, where strong upwelling drives intense new production.The biological effect is larger in AS than in BoB,as seasonal upwelling and mixing are strong in AS,especially in the northeast,while coastal upwelling and mixing are weak in BoB.</p>

				<title>Spatial distribution of atmospheric carbon monoxide over Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea: Measurements during pre-monsoon period of 2006</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0449-0455</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)conducted the ‘Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB)’for a two-month pre-monsoon period in 2006 with the ocean segment covering Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.During this campaign,carbon monoxide (CO) was continuously monitored using a non-dispersive IR analyser. Quantifying CO in ambient air is vital in determining the air quality of a region.Being toxic,CO is a criteria pollutant,but it is a weak green house gas.Globally,very few measurements exist over marine atmospheres to study its temporal pattern;particularly <i>in situ</i> CO measurements are few over the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea for comparison.Present measurements indicate:(i)predominant single peak in the diurnal pattern of CO over the marine atmosphere in contrast to the double peak over the continent, (ii)the mean diurnal CO over the marine atmosphere showing an increasing trend towards evening hours,(iii)the amplitude of the AN peaks over the marine atmosphere was ∼100 ppbv,while at a remote island site in the Indian Ocean it was ∼5 ppbv and (iv)high CO values were observed close to continent and the long range transport by wind also caused CO highs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Prediction of wind speed in the atmospheric boundary layer is important for wind energy assess- ment,satellite launching and aviation,etc.There are a few techniques available for wind speed prediction,which require a minimum number of input parameters.Four different statistical techniques,viz.,curve ﬁtting,Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA),extrapolation with periodic function and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN)are employed to predict wind speed.These methods require wind speeds of previous hours as input.It has been found that wind speed can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy using two methods,viz.,extrapolation using periodic curve ﬁtting and ANN and the other two methods are not very useful.</p>

				<title>Dependence of thermal conductivity of snow on microstructure</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0465-0475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A geometrical model,including different geometrical shapes in ﬂuencing thermal conductivity of snow is proposed.The geometrical model has been assumed to comprise of unit cells having solid (ice)inclusion as an aggregation of spherical,cylindrical or cubical shapes with vertical connection, arranged in a cubic packing.From the geometrical model and one-dimensional heat transfer theory, the effective thermal conductivity has been computed.For this purpose,coupled one-dimensional heat transfer equations have been solved for steady-state condition to account for conduction in ice, conduction in air and latent heat transfer due to water vapour sublimation through air.The model demonstrates the dependency of thermal conductivity on density,grain-spacing,grain contact ratio and temperature.Spherical inclusions give highest conductivity while cubical inclusion estimates lowest value for the same density.Thermal conductivity has been found increasing sharply near to the packing density for all three shapes.Empirical model results and results obtained from existing microstructure based models have also been compared with the present model.</p>

				<title>Simultaneous transport of water and solutes under transient unsaturated flow conditions – A case study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0477-0487</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The imbalance between incoming and outgoing salt causes salinization of soils and sub-soils that result in increasing the salinity of stream-ﬂows and agriculture land.This salinization is a serious environmental hazard particularly in semi-arid and arid lands.In order to estimate the magnitude of the hazard posed by salinity,it is important to understand and identify the processes that control salt movement from the soil surface through the root zone to the ground water and stream ﬂows.In the present study,Malaprabha sub-basin (up to dam site)has been selected which has two distinct climatic zones,sub-humid (upstream of Khanapur)and semi-arid region (downstream of Khanapur).In the upstream,both surface and ground waters are used for irrigation,whereas in the downstream mostly groundwater is used.Both soils and ground waters are more saline in down- stream parts of the study area.In this study we characterized the soil salinity and groundwater quality in both areas.An attempt is also made to model the distribution of potassium concentration in the soil proﬁle in response to varying irrigation conditions using the SWIM (Soil –Water In ﬁltration and Movement)model.Fair agreement was obtained between predicted and measured results indicating the applicability of the model.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Borehole data reveals that during Late Quaternary,the Ganga river was non-existent in its present location near Varanasi.Instead,it was ﬂowing further south towards peripheral craton.Himalayan derived grey micaceous sands were being carried by southward ﬂowing rivers beyond the present day water divide of Ganga and mixed with pink arkosic sand brought by northward ﬂowing peninsular rivers.Subsequently,the Ganga shifted to its present position and got incised.Near Varanasi,the Ganga river is ﬂowing along a NW –SE tectonic lineament.The migration of Ganga river is believed to have been in response to basin expansion caused due to Himalayan tectonics during Middle Pleistocene times.</p>
					<p>Multi-storied sand bodies generated as a result of channel migration provide excellent aquifers conﬁned by a thick zone of muddy sediments near the surface.Good quality potable water is available at various levels below about 70 m depth in sandy aquifers.Craton derived gravelly coarse- to-medium grained sand forms the main aquifer zones of tens of meter thickness with enormous yield.In contrast,the shallow aquifers made up of recycled inter ﬂuve silt and sandy silt occur under unconﬁned conditions and show water-level ﬂuctuation of a few meters during pre-and post-monsoon periods.</p>

				<title>Pattern of sedimentation during the Late Paleozoic, Gondwanaland glaciation: An example from the Talchir Formation, Satpura Gondwana basin, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0499-0519</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Talchir Formation of Permian age is the lowermost lithostratigraphic unit of the Indian Gondwana successions preserving a record of the Late Paleozoic glaciation that affected the whole Gondwanaland.The formation unconformably overlies the Precambrian basement in all the Gondwana basins of India,and marks initiation of sedimentation after a long hiatus since the Pro- terozoic.The Talchir Formation of the Satpura Gondwana basin of central India shows features diagnostic of deposition under glacial regime such as the presence of diamictites,boulder pavements, bedding plane striation,faceted/striated gravels,bullet-shaped clasts,dropstone,cryoturbation, etc.The Talchir strata of the Satpura basin,in addition to tidal signatures,contain marine bivalve and trace fossils.A proglacial marine environment is thus inferred for their deposition.The dominant lithologies are conglomerate,pebbly sandstone,sandstone and shale with little limestone, which can be classiﬁed into the following major facies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>matrix-supported conglomerate,</li>
						<li>clast-supported conglomerate,</li>
						<li>cross-strati ﬁed,channel form pebbly sandstone,</li>
						<li>hummocky,swaley or low-angle cross-strati ﬁed pebbly and non-pebbly sandstone,</li>
						<li>turbidite/tempestite sheet sandstone,</li>
						<li>massive to ﬁssile,green to black claystone with carbonate layers and nodules.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The conglomerates are interpreted as deposits of a spectrum of sub-aqueous sediment gravity lows including debris flow, hyperconcentrated/concentrated density flow and grain flow. The crossstratified pebbly sandstone bodies, on the other hand, represent braidplain delta deposits of glacial outwash origin. Hummocky, swaley, low-angle cross-stratified sediment bodies were deposited by storm-generated combined flows in a shoreface setting. In contrast, the sheet sandstone bodies are products of turbidity currents and storm-induced density currents in an inner shelf setting below fair weather wave base. The claystone facies is interpreted as a product of suspension fallout from hypopycnal sediment plumes in the outer shelf domain below storm wave base. All the lithofacies described above occur repetitively in the succession. Three facies-associations have been recognized in the Talchir Formation, representing ice-contact fandelta, outwash braidplain delta and a virtually ice-free, non-deltaic open marine realm. The different marine facies of the Talchir Formation define a number of shallowing-upward packages, which are arranged in the succession with a retrogradational trend to result in an overall fining- and deepening-upward succession. The overlying coal-bearing Barakar Formation has been interpreted to have formed in a tide-wave influenced deltaic setting with a marine, prodeltaic part. The strata that are transitional between Talchir and Barakar Formations show preservation of abundant plant materials suggesting gradual warming. The three facies-associations of the Talchir Formation also point towards progressive decrease in the intensity of glacial activity, inducing changes in the paleogeography from ice-contact depositional environment to an eventually relatively ice-free, open marine condition.</p>

				<title>Indicator minerals as guides to base metal sulphide mineralisation in Betul Belt, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0521-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Zn-bearing minerals that act as indicator minerals for base metal sulphide mineralization from the  Proterozoic Betul Belt,central India with special emphasis on their genetic signiﬁcance have been discussed.Sulphide mineralisation is hosted by the felsic volcanic rocks and has similarities with volcanic-hosted massive sulphide deposits in other parts of the world.Synvolcanic hydrothermal alteration is crudely zoned with an inner high Mg-Ca core and an outer wider envelop of Al-Fe rich mineral assemblage.Most of the prospects have strata bound,moderately to steeply dipping, multiple,sub-parallel sheet like ore bodies composed of disseminated and semi-massive to massive ores.Zn-bearing spinel,staurolite,biotite and ilmenite typically occur within the foot-wall altera- tion zones in close proximity to the sulphide mineralization.Zincian spinel is ubiquitous irrespective of the nature of alteration zone.Zincian staurolite is nearly absent in Mg-Ca alteration zones but commonly present in Al-Fe alteration zone along with zincian ilmenite.Zn-bearing biotite in intimate association with zincian spinel is generally found in Mg-Ca alteration zone and in the transition to Al-Fe alteration zone.Most of these indicator minerals can be considered as products of desulphidation of sphalerite during metamorphism.Mechanisms other than desulphidation like  formation of gahnite by overstepping of the zinc saturation limit of biotite during retrogression to chlorite and formation of zincian staurolite at the expense of gahnite is also recorded.Field presence of these minerals has immense signiﬁcance in exploration in Betul Belt as they occur in close spatial relationship with the sulphide rich zones and therefore act as direct vectors to ore.</p>

				<title>The High Deccan duricrusts of India and their significance for the ‘laterite’ issue</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0537-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Deccan region of western India ferricrete duricrusts,usually described as laterites,cap some basalt summits east of the Western Ghats escarpment,basalts of the low-lying Konkan Plain to its west,as well as some sizeable isolated basalt plateaus rising from the Plain. The duricrusts are iron-cemented saprolite with vermiform hollows,but apart from that have little in common with the common descriptions of laterite.The classical laterite proﬁle is not present.In particular there are no pisolitic concretions,no or minimal development of con-cretionary crust,and the pallid zone,commonly assumed to be typical of laterites,is absent. A relatively thin,non-indurated saprolite usually lies between the duricrust and fresh basalt.The duricrust resembles the classical laterite of Angadippuram in Kerala (southwestern India),but is much harder.The High Deccan duricrusts capping the basalt summits in the Western Ghats have been interpreted as residuals from a continuous (but now largely destroyed)laterite blanket that represents <i>in situ</i> transformation of the uppermost lavas,and thereby as marking the original top of the lava pile.But the unusual pattern of the duricrusts on the map and other evidence suggest instead that the duricrusts formed along a palaeoriver system,and are now in inverted relief.The two interpretations lead to different tectonic histories.Duricrust formation involved lateral material input besides vertical elemental exchange.We may have reached the stage when the very concepts of laterite and lateritization are hindering progress in regolith research.</p>

				<title>Comparing groundwater recharge and base flow in the Bukmoongol small-forested watershed, Korea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0553-0566</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groundwater recharge and base ﬂow using different investigated methods are simulated in the 15-ha Bukmoongol small-forested watershed located at the southern part of Korea.The WHAT system, PART,RORA,PULSE,BFI,and RAP software are used to estimate groundwater recharge or base ﬂow and base ﬂow index from the measured stream ﬂow.Results show that about 15 –31 per cent of annual rainfall might be contributed for base ﬂow.The watershed groundwater recharge proportions are computed to about 10 –21 per cent during the wet period and 23 –32 per cent for the remainder periods.Mean annual base ﬂow indices vary from 0.25 to 0.76 estimated using different methods. However,the study found out that all methods were signiﬁcantly correlated with each other.The similarity of various methods is expressed as a weighted relationship provided by the matrix product from the principal component analysis.Overall,the BFI and WHAT software appeared consistent in estimating recharge or base ﬂow,and base ﬂow index under Korea ’s conditions.The case study recommends the application of different models to other watersheds as well as in low-lying areas where most observation groundwater wells are located with available stream ﬂow data.</p>

				<title>Surface energy balance of seasonal snow cover for snow-melt estimation in N–W Himalaya</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0567-0573</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study describes time series analysis of snow-melt,radiation data and energy balance for a seasonal snow cover at Dhundi ﬁeld station of SASE,which lies in Pir Panjal range of the  N –W Himalaya,for a winter season from 13 January to 12 April 2005.The analysis shows that mean snow surface temperature remains very close to the melting temperature of snow.It was found close to -1&#176;C for the complete observational period which makes the snow pack at Dhundi moist from its beginning.The average air temperature over this period was found to be 3.5&#176;C with hourly average variation from -5.5&#176;C to 13&#176;C. The snow surface at this station received a mean short wave radiation of 430 W m<sup>−2</sup>, out of which 298 W m<sup>−2</sup> was re ﬂected back by the snow surface with mean albedo value of 0.70. The high average temperature and more absorption of solar radiation resulted in higher thermal state of the snowpack which was further responsible for faster and higher densiﬁcation of the snowpack. Net radiation energy was the major component of surface energy budget with a mean value of 83 W m<sup>−2</sup>. Bulk transfer model was used to calculate turbulent ﬂuxes. The net energy was utilized for satisfying cold content and snow-melt by using measured snow surface temperature and density of snow pack. The mean square error between calculated and measured daily snow-melt was found to be approximately 6.6 mm of water equivalent.</p>

				<title>Mountain range specific analog weather forecast model for northwest Himalaya in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0575-0587</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mountain range speciﬁc analog weather forecast model is developed utilizing surface weather observations of reference stations in each mountain range in northwest Himalaya (NW-Himalaya).The model searches past similar cases from historical dataset of reference observatory in each mountain range based on current situation.The searched past similar cases of each mountain range are used to draw weather forecast for that mountain range in operational weather forecasting mode, three days in advance.The developed analog weather forecast model is tested with the independent dataset of more than 717 days (542 days for Pir Panjal range in HP)of the past 4 winters (2003 –2004 to 2006 –2007).Independent test results are reasonably good and suggest that there is some possibility of forecasting weather in operational weather forecasting mode employing analog method over different mountain ranges in NW-Himalaya.Signiﬁcant difference in overall accuracy of the model is found for prediction of snow day and no-snow day over different mountain ranges, when weather is predicted under snow day and no-snow day weather forecast categories respectively.In the same mountain range,signi ﬁcant difference is also found in overall accuracy of the model for prediction of snow day and no-snow day for different areas.This can be attributed to their geographical position and topographical differences.The analog weather forecast model performs better than persistence and climatological forecast for day-1 predictions for all the mountain ranges except Karakoram range in NW-Himalaya.The developed analog weather forecast model may help as a guidance tool for forecasting weather in operational weather forecasting mode in different mountain ranges in NW-Himalaya.</p>

				<title>The WRF model performance for the simulation of heavy precipitating events over Ahmedabad during August 2006</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0589-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The summer monsoon season of the year 2006 was highlighted by an unprecedented number of monsoon lows over the central and the western parts of India,particularly giving widespread rainfall over Gujarat and Rajasthan.Ahmedabad had received 540.2 mm of rainfall in the month of August 2006 against the climatological mean of 219.8 mm.The two spells of very heavy rainfall of 108.4 mm and 97.7 mm were recorded on 8 and 12 August 2006 respectively.Due to meteorological complexities involved in replicating the rainfall occurrences over a region,the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF –ARW version)modeling system with two different cumulus schemes in a nested con ﬁguration is chosen for simulating these events.The spatial distributions of large-scale circulation and moisture ﬁelds have been simulated reasonably well in this model,though there are some spatial biases in the simulated rainfall pattern.The rainfall amount over Ahmedabad has been underestimated by both the cumulus parameterization schemes.The quantitative validation of the simulated rainfall is done by calculating the categorical skill scores like frequency bias,threat scores (TS)and equitable threat scores (ETS).In this case the KF scheme has outperformed the GD scheme for the low precipitation threshold.</p>

				<title>Skills of different mesoscale models over Indian region during monsoon season: Forecast errors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0603-0620</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Performance of four mesoscale models namely,the MM5,ETA,RSM and WRF,run at NCMRWF for short range weather forecasting has been examined during monsoon-2006.Evaluation is carried out based upon comparisons between observations and day-1 and day-3 forecasts of wind,temperature,speciﬁc humidity,geopotential height,rainfall,systematic errors,root mean square errors and speciﬁc events like the monsoon depressions.</p>
					<p>It is very difficult to address the question of which model performs best over the Indian region? An honest answer is ‘none ’.Perhaps an ensemble approach would be the best.However, if we must  make a ﬁnal verdict,it can be stated that in general,(i)the WRF is able to produce best All India rainfall prediction compared to observations in the day-1 forecast and,the MM5 is able to produce best All India rainfall forecasts in day-3,but ETA and RSM are able to depict the best distribution of rainfall maxima along the west coast of India,(ii)the MM5 is able to produce least RMSE of wind and geopotential ﬁelds at most of the time,and (iii)the RSM is able to produce least errors in the day-1 forecasts of the tracks,while the ETA model produces least errors in the day-3 forecasts.</p>

				<page>0621-0635</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study real time data have been used to compare the standard and triangle method by performing the objective analysis of mean sea level pressure.In the standard method,derivative ﬁelds are obtained from the grid point data using ﬁnite difference scheme whereas in the triangle method,a set of non-overlapping triangles are formed from the observations and the scalar and the spatial derivatives are computed directly at the centroid of each of the non-overlapping triangles.These scalars and their derivatives are then mapped to uniform grids by using the standard method.It has been found that objectively analysed scalar ﬁeld obtained using standard method is superior to the scalar ﬁeld derived by the triangle method,whereas the derivative ﬁelds produced by triangle method are superior to the derivative ﬁelds produced using standard method. A variational objective analysis scheme has been developed and an experiment has been carried out with depression case of June (11 –15)2004.It is found that the new scheme (variational)is able to extract the better parts of both triangle and standard methods.The results of this study will be useful in carrying out diagnostic calculations that involve derivative estimates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Tree-ring-width index chronologies of teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i> L.F.)from three sites in central India have been studied for their dendroclimatic potential.The existence of good correlation among the three site chronologies indicates the inﬂuence of common forcing factor  to the tree growth of the region.Tree growth and climate relationship based on correlation analysis revealed the important contribution of moisture index and rainfall rather than the direct in ﬂuence of the temperature on tree growth during different seasons.Signiﬁcant positive relationship of moisture index and rainfall during the monsoon months as well as on the annual scale with tree-ring width variations over the region indicates the important role of moisture availability at the root zone.The results suggest that the teak tree-ring chronologies can be used as high resolution proxy for past precipitation and moisture level in the environment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we present a seismic hazard scenario for the Garhwal region of the north-western Himalayan range, in terms of the horizontal Peak Ground Acceleration. The scenario earthquake of moment magnitude $M_w$ 8.5 has a 10% exceedance probability over the next 50 years. These estimates, the first for the region, were calculated through a stepwise process based on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>An estimation of the Maximum Credible Earthquake from the seismicity of the region and Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program considerations, and</li>
						<li>four seismotectonic parameters abstracted from near field weak-motion data recorded at five stations installed in Chamoli District of the Garhwal region in the aftermath of the 1999 Chamoli earthquake. The latter include:</li>
						<li>The frequency dependent power law for the shear wave quality factor, $Q_S$,</li>
						<li>the site amplification at each station using horizontal-to-vertical-spectral ratio and generalized inversion technique,</li>
						<li>source parameters of various events recorded by the array and application of the resulting relations between the scalar seismic moment $M_0$ (dyne-cm) and moment magnitude Mw and the corner frequency, $f_c$ (Hz) and moment magnitude $M_w$ to simulate spectral acceleration due to higher magnitude events corresponding to the estimated Maximum Credible Earthquake, and </li>
						<li>regional and site specific local spectral attenuation relations at different geometrically central frequencies in the low, moderate and high frequency bands.</li>

				<title>Uncertainties in the estimation of $M_{\max}$</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0671-0682</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present paper, the parameters affecting the uncertainties on the estimation of $M_{\max}$ have been investigated by exploring different methodologies being used in the analysis of seismicity catalogue and estimation of seismicity parameters. A critical issue to be addressed before any scientific analysis is to assess the quality, consistency, and homogeneity of the data. The empirical relationships between different magnitude scales have been used for conversions for homogenization of seismicity catalogues to be used for further seismic hazard assessment studies. An endeavour has been made to quantify the uncertainties due to magnitude conversions and the seismic hazard parameters are then estimated using different methods to consider the epistemic uncertainty in the process. The study area chosen is around Delhi. The 𝑏 value and the magnitude of completeness for the four seismogenic sources considered around Delhi varied more than 40% using the three catalogues compiled based on different magnitude conversion relationships. The effect of the uncertainties has been then shown on the estimation of $M_{\max}$ and the probabilities of occurrence of different magnitudes. It has been emphasized to consider the uncertainties and their quantification to carry out seismic hazard assessment and in turn the seismic microzonation.</p>

				<page>0683-0705</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Success of earthquake resistant design practices critically depends on how accurately the future ground motion can be determined at a desired site. But very limited recorded data are available about ground motion in India for engineers to rely upon. To identify the needs of engineers, under such circumstances, in estimating ground motion time histories, this article presents a detailed review of literature on modeling and synthesis of strong ground motion data. In particular, modeling of seismic sources and earth medium, analytical and empirical Green’s functions approaches for ground motion simulation, stochastic models for strong motion and ground motion relations are covered. These models can be used to generate realistic near-field and far-field ground motion in regions lacking strong motion data. Numerical examples are shown for illustration by taking Kutch earthquake-2001 as a case study.</p>

				<title>Spatial-Temporal variability of seismic hazard in Peninsular India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0707-0718</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper examines the variability of seismic activity observed in the case of different geological zones of peninsular India (10&#176;N$–$26&#176;N; 68&#176;E$–$90&#176;E) based on earthquake catalog between the period 1842 and 2002 and estimates earthquake hazard for the region. With compilation of earthquake catalog in terms of moment magnitude and establishing broad completeness criteria, we derive the seismicity  parameters for each geologic zone of peninsular India using maximum likelihood procedure. The estimated parameters provide the basis for understanding the historical seismicity associated with different geological zones of peninsular India and also provide important inputs for future seismic hazard estimation studies in the region. Based on present investigation, it is clear that earthquake recurrence activity in various geologic zones of peninsular India is distinct and varies considerably between its cratonic and rifting zones. The study identifies the likely hazards due to the possibility of moderate to large earthquakes in peninsular India and also presents the influence of spatial rate variation in the seismic activity of this region. This paper presents the influence of source zone characterization and recurrence rate variation pattern on the maximum earthquake magnitude estimation. The results presented in the paper provide a useful basis for probabilistic seismic hazard studies and microzonation studies in peninsular India.</p>

				<title>Dynamic soil properties for microzonation of Delhi, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0719-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Delhi, the capital of India, has experienced mild seismic shaking during several earthquakes in the past. The large variations of depth to bedrock and ground water table coupled with different soil types at different locations of Delhi necessitate a seismic microzonation study. Dynamic soil properties such as shear wave velocity, modulus reduction and damping characteristics of local soils are the basic and essential input parameters for conducting even a preliminary ground response analysis which is an essential input in microzonation studies. Shear wave velocity is not measured routinely due to its high cost and lack of the required expertise. Several researchers in the past developed correlations between shear wave velocity ($V_s$) and routinely measured 𝑁 values. In the present study, shear wave velocity profiles measured in the field at more than 80 borehole locations to a depth of about 20 to 32m using Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) are presented and correlations between shear wave velocity and 𝑁 values are also presented for use by engineers and designers. Results of strain and stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests on remoulded samples of sandsilt mixtures in the high strain range are used for generating the modulus reduction and damping curves and are compared with the well-known curves in the literature. The results presented in this article can be used for microzonation studies as well as site specific ground response analyses at Delhi.</p>

				<title>Importance of quantification of local site effects based on wave propagation in seismic microzonation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0731-0748</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the three most important aspects of seismic microzonation namely prediction of fundamental frequency (F<sub>0</sub>) of soil deposit, aggravation factor (aggravation factor is simply the extra spectral amplification due to complex 2D site effects over the 1D response of the soil column) and the spatial variability of the ground motion caused by the basin-edge induced Love waves. The predicted F<sub>0</sub> of single, double and three-soil-layered models revealed that the available empirical relations to predict the F<sub>0</sub> of layered soil deposits are inadequate. We recommend the use of analytical or numerical methods to predict such an important parameter based on wave propagation effects. An increase of amplitude of Love wave, strain level and average aggravation factor (AAF) with increase of impedance contrast was obtained. Based on the trend of rate of decrease of AAF and maximum strain with offset from the basin-edge, we can qualitatively infer that the effects of induced Love wave may reduce to a negligible value after a traveled distance of 6.5–10.0 𝜆<sub>𝐹</sub> (where 𝜆<sub>𝐹</sub> is the wavelength corresponding to the $F_o$ of soil layer). The obtained increase of strain level with the decrease of distance between two receiver points used for the computation of strain reflects that structures having spatial extent smaller than the 𝜆<sub>F</sub> may suffer damage due to the basin-edge induced surface waves. The fast rate of decrease of strain with the offset from the strong lateral discontinuity (SLD)/basin-edge may be attributed to the dispersive nature of Love wave. We can incorporate the increased spectral amplification due to the induced surface waves in the form of aggravation factor but till date we have no effective way to incorporate the effects of developed strain by induced surface waves in seismic microzonation or in building codes.</p>

				<title>A technical note on seismic microzonation in the central United States</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0749-0756</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microzonation is an effort to evaluate and map potential hazards found in an area, urban area in particular, that could be induced by strong ground shaking during an earthquake. These hazards include: ground motion amplification, liquefaction, and slope failure. The microzonation maps, depicting ground-motion amplification, liquefaction, and landslide potentials, can be produced if the ground motion on bedrock (input) and the site conditions are known. These maps, in combination with ground-motion hazard maps (on bedrock), can be used to develop a variety of hazard mitigation strategies such as seismic risk assessment, emergency response and preparedness, and land-use planning. However, these maps have certain limitations that result from the nature of regional mapping, data limitations, generalization, and computer modeling. These microzonations show that when strong ground shaking occurs, damage is more likely to occur, or be more severe, in the higher hazard areas. The zones shown on the hazard maps should not serve as a substitute for site-specific evaluations.</p>

				<title>Site response zones and short-period earthquake ground motion projections for the Las Vegas Basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0757-0772</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A deterministic seismic hazard analysis was conducted to address the effect of local soil conditions on earthquake-induced strong ground motion in the Las Vegas Basin, Nevada (US). Using a large geological and geotechnical database, two response units were defined: a fine-grained unit, predominantly clay; and a coarse-grained unit, predominantly gravel. A moderate number of high-quality shallow shear wave velocity measurements were collected from which characteristic shear wave velocity profiles were developed for each response unit. An equivalent-linear one-dimensional site response model was used. The model was calibrated using a basin-wide, small-strain ground motion database. Calibration tests showed that ground motion projections become increasingly conservative with increasing ground-motion amplitude. Projections were overconservative for the coarsegrained response unit, likely due to the sparseness of the velocity database. For the earthquake response analyses, historical ground motions were used to model characteristic ‘bedrock’ motion for earthquakes on 10 faults judged to be critical. Response spectral envelopes were generated for each unit through Monte-Carlo simulations. For the fine-grained response unit, 95th percentile peak ground acceleration, peak spectral acceleration and predominant period were 310 cm/s<sup>2</sup>, 1100cm/s<sup>2</sup>, and 0.29 s, respectively. With respect to codified design spectra, projections are lower at short periods and higher at long periods. Projections of peak spectral accelerations for the coarsegrained response unit, were more than double that of codified spectra; however, they are believed to be overconservative. Near-fault effects and basin-edge effects, though potentially important, were not considered in these analyses.</p>

				<title>Site response of the Ganges Basin inferred from re-evaluated macroseismic observations from the 1897 Shillong, 1905 Kangra and 1934 Nepal earthquakes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0773-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyze previously published geodetic data and intensity values for the $M_s = 8.1$ Shillong (1897), $M_s = 7.8$ Kangra (1905), and $M_s = 8.2$ Nepal/Bihar (1934) earthquakes to investigate the rupture zones of these earthquakes as well as the amplification of ground motions throughout the Punjab, Ganges and Brahmaputra valleys. For each earthquake we subtract the observed MSK intensities from a synthetic intensity derived from an inferred planar rupture model of the earthquake, combined with an attenuation function derived from instrumentally recorded earthquakes. The resulting residuals are contoured to identify regions of anomalous intensity caused primarily by local site effects. Observations indicative of liquefaction are treated separately from other indications of shaking severity lest they inflate inferred residual shaking estimates. Despite this precaution we find that intensites are 1–3 units higher near the major rivers, as well as at the edges of the Ganges basin. We find evidence for a post-critical Moho reflection from the 1897 and 1905 earthquakes that raises intensities 1–2 units at distances of the order of 150 km from the rupture zone, and we find that the 1905 earthquake triggered a substantial subsequent earthquake at Dehra Dun, at a distance of approximately 150 km. Four or more 𝑀 = 8 earthquakes are apparently overdue in the region based on seismic moment summation in the past 500 years. Results from the current study permit anticipated intensities in these future earthquakes to be refined to incorporate site effects derived from dense macroseismic data.</p>

				<title>Considerations on seismic microzonation in areas with two-dimensional hills</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0783-0796</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the results of an extensive numerical parametric study on seismic behavior of 2D homogenous hills subjected to vertically propagating incident SV waves. It is shown that the amplification potential of these hills is strongly influenced by the wavelength, by the shape ratio, by the shape of the hill and in a less order of importance, by the Poisson ratio of the media. The 2D topography effect could be ignored, only if the hill has a shape ratio of less than 0.1 or if it is subjected to incident waves with predominant dimensionless periods of greater than 13 times the shape ratio. In incidence of waves with wavelengths longer than the width of the hill, the amplification curve usually finds its maximum at the crest and decreases towards the base of the hill. Else, some de-amplification zones would occur along the hill. Among hills with similar shape ratios, those with intermediate cross section areas show intermediate seismic behavior, too.  Estimated seismic site coefficients for the crest of a 2D rocky hill depend on its shape ratio and could reach even 1.7, which encourages one to classify it according to standard site categorization procedures as soil profile types SC or SD instead of the conventional SB type.</p>

				<title>Preliminary results for a semi-automated quantification of site effects using geomorphometry and ASTER satellite data for Mozambique, Pakistan and Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0797-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estimation of the degree of local seismic wave amplification (site effects) requires precise information about the local site conditions. In many regions of the world, local geologic information is either sparse or is not readily available. Because of this, seismic hazard maps for countries such as Mozambique, Pakistan and Turkey are developed without consideration of site factors and, therefore, do not provide a complete assessment of future hazards. Where local geologic information is available, details on the traditional maps often lack the precision (better than 1:10,000 scale) or the level of information required for modern seismic microzonation requirements. We use high-resolution (1:50,000) satellite imagery and newly developed image analysis methods to begin addressing this problem. Our imagery, consisting of optical data and digital elevation models (DEMs), is recorded from the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) sensor system. We apply a semi-automated, object-oriented, multi-resolution feature segmentation method to identify and extract local terrain features. Then we classify the terrain types into mountain, piedmont and basin units using geomorphometry (topographic slope) as our parameter. Next, on the basis of the site classification schemes from the Wills and Silva (1998) study and the Wills <i>et al</i> (2000) and Wills and Clahan (2006) maps of California, we assign the local terrain units with $V_s$ 30 (the average seismic shear-wave velocity through the upper 30m of the subsurface) ranges for selected regions in Mozambique, Pakistan and Turkey. We find that the applicability of our site class assignments in each region is a good first-approximation for quantifying local site conditions and that additional work, such as the verification of the terrain’s compositional rigidity, is needed.</p>

				<title>Earthquake hazard in northeast India – A seismic microzonation approach with typical case studies from Sikkim Himalaya and Guwahati city</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0809-0831</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive analytical as well as numerical treatment of seismological, geological, geomorphological and geotechnical concepts has been implemented through microzonation projects in the northeast Indian provinces of Sikkim Himalaya and Guwahati city, representing cases of contrasting geological backgrounds – a hilly terrain and a predominantly alluvial basin respectively. The estimated maximum earthquakes in the underlying seismic source zones, demarcated in the broad northeast Indian region, implicates scenario earthquakes of $M_W$ 8.3 and 8.7 to the respective study regions for deterministic seismic hazard assessments. The microzonation approach as undertaken in the present analyses involves multi-criteria seismic hazard evaluation through thematic integration of contributing factors. The geomorphological themes for Sikkim Himalaya include surface geology, soil cover, slope, rock outcrop and landslide integrated to achieve geological hazard distribution. Seismological themes, namely surface consistent peak ground acceleration and predominant frequency were, thereafter, overlaid on and added with the geological hazard distribution to obtain the seismic hazard microzonation map of the Sikkim Himalaya. On the other hand, the microzonation study of Guwahati city accounts for eight themes – geological and geomorphological, basement or bedrock, landuse, landslide, factor of safety for soil stability, shear wave velocity, predominant frequency, and surface consistent peak ground acceleration. The five broad qualitative hazard classifications – ‘low’, ‘moderate’, ‘high’, ‘moderate high’ and ‘very high’ could be applied in both the cases, <i>albeit</i> with different implications to peak ground acceleration variations. These developed hazard maps offer better representation of the local specific seismic hazard variation in the terrain.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0833-0852</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, an attempt has been made to evaluate the seismic hazard considering local site effects by carrying out detailed geotechnical and geophysical site characterization in Bangalore, India to develop microzonation maps. An area of 220 km<sup>2</sup>, encompassing Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP) has been chosen as the study area. Seismic hazard analysis and microzonation of Bangalore are addressed in three parts: in the first part, estimation of seismic hazard is done using seismotectonic and geological information. Second part deals with site characterization using geotechnical and shallow geophysical techniques. In the last part, local site effects are assessed by carrying out one-dimensional (1-D) ground response analysis (using the program SHAKE 2000) using both standard penetration test (SPT) data and shear wave velocity data from multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) survey. Further, field experiments using microtremor studies have also been carried out for evaluation of predominant frequency of the soil columns. The same has been assessed using 1-D ground response analysis and compared with microtremor results. Further, the Seed and Idriss simplified approach has been adopted to evaluate the soil liquefaction susceptibility and liquefaction resistance assessment. Microzonation maps have been prepared with a scale of 1:20,000. The detailed methodology, along with experimental details, collated data, results and maps are presented in this paper.</p>

				<title>Seismic hazard assessment of Chennai city considering local site effects</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0853-0863</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chennai city suffered moderate tremors during the 2001 Bhuj and Pondicherry earthquakes and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake. After the Bhuj earthquake, Indian Standard IS: 1893 was revised and Chennai city was upgraded from zone II to zone III which leads to a substantial increase of the design ground motion parameters. Therefore, a comprehensive study is carried out to assess the seismic hazard of Chennai city based on a deterministic approach. The seismicity and seismotectonic details within a 100 km radius of the study area have been considered. The one-dimensional ground response analysis was carried out for 38 representative sites by the equivalent linear method using the SHAKE91 program to estimate the ground motion parameters considering the local site effects. The shear wave velocity profile was inferred from the corrected blow counts and it was verified with the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Wave (MASW) test performed for a representative site. The seismic hazard is represented in terms of characteristic site period and Spectral Acceleration Ratio (SAR) contours for the entire city. It is found that structures with low natural period undergo significant amplification mostly in the central and southern parts of Chennai city due to the presence of deep soil sites with clayey or sandy deposits and the remaining parts undergo marginal amplification.</p>

				<title>Proposed seismic hazard maps of Sumatra and Java Islands and microzonation study of Jakarta City, Indonesia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0865-0878</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the development of spectral hazard maps for Sumatra and Java islands, Indonesia and microzonation study for Jakarta city. The purpose of this study is to propose a revision of the seismic hazard map in Indonesian Seismic Code SNI 03-1726-2002. Some improvements in seismic hazard analysis were implemented in the analysis by considering the recent seismic activities around Java and Sumatra. The seismic hazard analysis was carried out using 3-dimension (3-D) seismic source models (fault source model) using the latest research works regarding the tectonic setting of Sumatra and Java. Two hazard levels were analysed for representing 10% and 2% probability of exceedance (PE) in 50 years ground motions for Sumatra and Java. Peak ground acceleration contour maps for those two hazard levels and two additional macrozonation maps for 10% PE in 50 years were produced during this research. These two additional maps represent short period (0.2 s) and long-period (1.0 s) spectra values at the bedrock. Microzonation study is performed in order to obtain ground motion parameters such as acceleration, amplification factor and response spectra at the surface of Jakarta. The analyses were carried out using nonlinear approach. The results were used to develop contour of acceleration at the surface of Jakarta. Finally, the design response spectra for structural design purposes are proposed in this study.</p>

				<title>Relative seismic shaking vulnerability microzonation using an adaptation of the Nakamura Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio Method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0879-0895</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An alternative seismic shaking vulnerability survey method to computational intensive theoretical modelling of site response to earthquake, and time consuming test <i>versus</i> reference site horizontal ratio methods, is described. The methodology is suitable for small to large scale engineering investigations. Relative seismic shaking vulnerability microzonation using an adaptation of the Nakamura horizontal to vertical spectral ratio method provides many advantages over alternative methods including: low cost; rapid field phase (100 km<sup>2</sup> can easily be covered by a single operator in 5 days); low and flexible instrumentation requirements (a single seismometer and data logger of almost any type is required); field data can be collected at any time during the day or night (the results are insensitive to ambient social noise); no basement rock reference site is required (thus eliminating trigger synchronisation between reference and multiple test site seismographs); rapid software aided analysis; insensitivity to ground-shaking resonance peaks; ability to compare results obtained from non-contiguous survey fields. The methodology is described in detail, and a practical case study is provided, including mapped results. The resulting microzonation maps indicate the relative seismic shaking vulnerability for built structures of different height categories within adjacent zones, with a resolution of approximately 1 km.</p>

				<title>Urban effects of Chennai on sea breeze induced convection and precipitation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0897-0909</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Doppler radar derived wind speed and direction proﬁles showed a well developed sea breeze circulation over the Chennai, India region on 28 June, 2003. Rainfall totals in excess of 100 mm resulted from convection along the sea breeze front. Inland propagation of the sea  breeze front was observed in radar reﬂectivity imagery. High-resolution MM5 simulations were used to investigate the inﬂuence of Chennai urban land use on sea breeze initiated convection and precipitation. A comparison of observed and simulated 10 m wind speed and direction over Chennai showed that the model was able to simulate the timing and strength of the sea breeze. Urban effects are shown to increase the near surface air temperature over Chennai by 3.0 K during the early morning hours. The larger surface temperature gradient along the coast due to urban effects increased onshore ﬂow by 4.0m s<sup>−1</sup>. Model sensitivity study revealed that precipitation totals were enhanced by 25 mm over a large region 150 km west of Chennai due to urban effects. Deﬁciency in model physics related to night-time forecasts are addressed.</p>

				<title>On the measurement of the surface energy budget over a land surface during the summer monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0911-0923</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The measurement of surface energy balance over a land surface in an open area in Bangalore is reported. Measurements of all variables needed to calculate the surface energy balance on time scales longer than a week are made. Components of radiative ﬂuxes are measured while sensible and latent heat ﬂuxes are based on the bulk method using measurements made at two levels on a micrometeorological tower of 10 m height. The bulk ﬂux formulation is veriﬁed by comparing its ﬂuxes with direct ﬂuxes using sonic anemometer data sampled at 10 Hz.Soil temperature is measured at 4 depths. Data have been continuously collected for over 6 months covering pre-monsoon and monsoon periods during the year 2006. The study ﬁrst addresses the issue of getting the ﬂuxes accurately.It is shown that water vapour measurements are the most crucial. A bias of 0.25% in relative humidity,which is well above the normal accuracy assumed by the manufacturers but achievable in the ﬁeld using a combination of laboratory calibration and ﬁeld intercomparisons, results in about 20 W m<sup>−2</sup> change in the latent heat ﬂux on the seasonal time scale. When seen on the seasonal time scale,the net longwave radiation is the largest energy loss term at the experimental site. The seasonal variation in the energy sink term is small compared to that in the energy source term.</p>

				<title>Estimation of urban mixed layer height in Zanjan using LIDAR observations and numerical modeling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0925-0934</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Air pollution predictions often require the height of atmospheric mixed layer in time especially in big cities. Here, the variation of the height of this layer is estimated from direct measurements and also from a numerical forecast model with a high resolution boundary layer scheme. The height of the daytime mixed layer for the city of Zanjan (48.5&#176;N, 36.7&#176;E, 1700 m above sea level)is measured using a LIDAR (532 nm)system, which works based on aerosols scattering of laser light. The mixed layer height ($z_i$) for Zanjan city, well above mean sea level compared to other major cities in the world,is found to be between 1.4 km typically in spring and 2.2 km in summer, for synoptic calm conditions. Also, the MM5 forecast model with a proper boundary layer scheme (MRF)is used to estimate $z_i$ which shows rather good agreement with direct observations using the LIDAR system. The entrainment zone of the mixed layer was also found to undergo some occasional temporal growth that may be attributed to shear instability that led to more mixed layer growth.</p>

				<title>Anaerobic oxidation of methane in coastal sediment from Guishan Island (Pearl River Estuary), South China Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0935-0943</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concentrations of CH<sub>4</sub>, SO$^{2−}_{4}$, 𝛴 CO<sub>2</sub> and the carbon isotope compositions of 𝛴 CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> in the pore-water of the GS sedimentary core collected from Guishan Island (Pearl River Estuary), South China Sea,were determined. The methane concentration in the pore-water shows dramatic changes and sulfate concentration gradients are linear at the base of the sulfate reduction zone for the station. The carbon isotope of methane becomes heavier at the sulfate-methane transition (SMT)likely because of the Raleigh distillation effect; <sup>12</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> was oxidized faster than <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> and this caused the enrichment of residual methane 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C and 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C-𝛿 CO<sub>2</sub> minimum. The geochemical proﬁles of the pore-water support the existence of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), which is mainly controlled by the quality and quantity of the sedimentary organic matter. As inferred from the index of 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C-TOC value and TOC/TN ratio, the organic matter is a mix of mainly refractory terrestrial component plus some labile alga marine-derived in the study area. A large amount of labile organic matter (mainly labile alga marine-derived) is consumed <i>via</i> the process of sedimentary organic matter diagenesis, and this reduces the amount of labile organic matter incorporated into the base of the sulfate reduction zone. Due to the scarcity of labile organic matter, the sulfate will in turn be consumed by its reaction with methane and therefore AOM takes place.Based on a diffussion model, the portion of pore-water sulfate reduction <i>via</i> AOM is 58.6%,and the percentage of 𝛴 CO<sub>2</sub> in the pore-water derived from AOM is 41.4%. Thus, AOM plays an important role in the carbon and sulfur cycling in the marine sediments of Pearl River Estuary.</p>

					<p>An analytical solution is obtained to predict the contaminant concentration along unsteady ground-water ﬂow in semi-in ﬁnite aquifer. Initially,the aquifer is not supposed to be solute free ,i.e.,aquifer is not clean.A time-dependent source concentration is considered at the origin of the aquifer and at the other end of the aquifer, it is supposed to be zero. The time-dependent forms of unsteady velocities are considered in which one such form ,i.e., sinusoidal form represents the seasonal pattern in a year in tropical regions. The Laplace Transformation Technique (LTT)is used to get an analytical solution and a graphical representation is made through MATLAB.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Biot ’s theory for wave propagation in saturated porous solid is modiﬁed to study the propagation  of thermoelastic waves in poroelastic medium. Propagation of plane harmonic waves is considered in isotropic poroelastic medium. Relations are derived among the wave-induced temperature in the medium and the displacements of ﬂuid and solid particles. Christoffel equations obtained are modiﬁed with the thermal as well as thermoelastic coupling parameters. These equations explain the existence and propagation of four waves in the medium. Three of the waves are attenuating longitudinal waves and one is a non-attenuating transverse wave. Thermal properties of the medium have no effect on the transverse wave. The velocities and attenuation of the longitudinal waves are computed for a numerical model of liquid-saturated sandstone. Their variations with thermal as well as poroelastic parameters are exhibited through numerical examples.</p>

				<title>Uplift along the western margin of the Deccan Basalt Province: Is there any geomorphometric evidence?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0959-0971</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In line with the passive margin landscape evolutionary model in vogue, sustained erosion and long-distance retreat of the Western Ghat escarpment are widely considered to be the results of erosionally-driven isostatic uplift since Tertiary by many workers. Others have postulated or adduced evidence for strong neotectonic activity in the Ghat region. An obvious question in this regard is whether there is any geomorphometric evidence in support of this widespread view? In order to test the hypothesis of ongoing post-rift fexural uplift or neotectonic activity in the western Deccan Basalt Province (DBP), geomorphometric analysis was carried out and commonly used geomorphic indices of active tectonics (GAT)were derived for 30 selected river basins on both sides of the Western Ghat. SRTM-DEM data and ArcGIS were used to derive the indices. Tectonic geomorphic analysis based on ﬁve proxy indicators suggests that the differences in GAT indices,  both along strike and across the Western Ghat,are statistically insigniﬁcant. The index values are nowhere close to the GAT values typically associated with drainage basins affected by active tectonics and deformation.Mapping of the indices reveals lack of discernable trends. The adduced results indicate that the western DBP belongs to the class of relatively low tectonic activity.</p>

				<title>Model-based remote sensing algorithms for particulate organic carbon (POC) in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrographic data, including particulate organic carbon (POC) from the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM) study, were combined with remotely-sensed SeaWiFS data to estimate POC concentration using principal component analysis (PCA). The spectral radiance was extracted at each NEGOM station, digitized, and averaged. The mean value and spurious trends were removed from each spectrum. De-trended data included six wavelengths at 58 stations. The correlation between the weighting factors of the first six eigenvectors and POC concentration were applied using multiple linear regression. PCA algorithms based on the first three, four, and five modes accounted for 90, 95, and 98% of total variance and yielded significant correlations with POC with 𝑅^{2} = 0.89, 0.92, and 0.93. These full waveband approaches provided robust estimates of POC in various water types.</p>
					<p>Three different analyses (root mean square error, mean ratio and standard deviation) showed similar error estimates, and suggest that spectral variations in the modes defined by just the first four characteristic vectors are closely correlated with POC concentration, resulting in only negligible loss of spectral information from additional modes. The use of POC algorithms greatly increases the spatial and temporal resolution for interpreting POC cycling and can be extrapolated throughout and perhaps beyond the area of shipboard sampling.</p>

				<title>Assessment of different topographic corrections in AWiFS satellite imagery of Himalaya terrain</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0011-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inﬂuence of topographic effects in optical satellite imagery is not investigated very extensively in the Himalayan terrain.The topographic variability causes a problem of differential illumination due to steep and varying slopes in rugged Himalayan terrain. Therefore,topographic corrections are essential for qualitative and quantitative analysis of snow cover applications.The present paper discusses the implementation of different topographic correction models on AWiFS sensor onboard IRS P6 satellite images and the qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis in detail.Both the Lambertian and non-Lambertian assumptions have been considered in the present analysis with the aim to explore best suitable empirical model for rugged terrain.The main topographic methods implemented are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>C-correction</li>
						<li>Minneart corrections</li>
						<li>Civco ’s modi ﬁed version of cosine correction</li>
						<li>two-stage normalization and</li>
						<li>slope matching technique.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Lambertian assumptions are found to be very unrealistic over Himalayan terrain as these lead to either underestimation or overestimation of physical parameters signiﬁcantly both on sunlit slopes as well as the slopes away from the Sun.This problem is overcome by considering non-Lambertian assumption.Minneart constant and C-correction coefficients for all AWiFS satellite bands are estimated using regression analysis.All the results due to topographic effects are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively using four criteria namely visual analysis,validation with ﬁeld measurements (<i>in-situ</i> observations),spectral re ﬂectance of training samples of snow on the south and north aspects and graphically.The visual analysis conﬁrms the minimization of three dimensional relief effects in two-stage normalization and slope matching methods and retrieves some of the information under mountain shadow.Due to the very bright surface of snow ﬁelds there is likely to be more diffuse reﬂected light in these areas than over darker vegetated surfaces.The qualitative analysis in other methods does not extract any information on shady slopes.The quantitative validation of topographic results in satellite imagery with <i>in-situ</i> observations shows underestimation of spectral reﬂectance of snow signiﬁcantly except for slope matching technique. It is also apparent that although all the topographic methods correct the reﬂectance of training snow samples on the south and north aspects but most acceptable values are achieved using slope matching.The results obtained from graphical analysis reveal that mean reﬂectance after all topo- graphic corrections are  independent of illumination.This study also suggests that the suitability of topographic models can not be concluded as successful based on single criterion.Slope matching technique is the only technique which satisﬁes all the four criteria successfully and produces the best result for Himalayan terrain.</p>

				<title>Western disturbances seen with AMSU-B and infrared sensors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0027-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Western disturbances (WD) of winter and pre-monsoon seasons are the important sources of rainfall in the Indo-Gangetic plains. WDs are troughs or circulations in the westerly winds modified by the Himalayas. Operationally, WDs are monitored using infrared (IR) and water vapour (WV) images. Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B), flying onboard the NOAA satellites, also allows WDs to be monitored in five microwave frequencies. Two are in water vapour window (89, 150 GHz) and three are absorption channels (centred at 183.31 GHz). Unlike the top of cloud view in IR or WV, AMSU-B radiances show the effect of moisture and hydrometeors in different layers.</p>
					<p>Two cases of WD (17 April 2001 and 18–19 February 2003) are discussed using the microwave data from AMSU-B and the IR and WV data from Meteosat-5. The aim here is to demonstrate the skill of AMSU-B in delineating structure of WDs. In particular, the cold intrusion and the moist conveyor belts are examined. It was found that the multi-channel view of the AMSU-B permits a better understanding of the moist structures seen in the conveyor belts.</p>
					<p>The <i>á trous</i> wavelet transform is used to clearly bring out mesoscale features in WDs. AMSU-B brings out intense convection as a large depression of BTs (&lt; 50K) at 150/176 GHz, cirrus and moist bands at 180/182 GHz.  Mesoscale convection lines within WDs that last short time are shown here for the first time only in the AMSU-B images. Large-scale cirrus features are separated using the <i>á trous</i> wavelet transform.</p>
					<p> Lastly, it is shown that there is a good likeness in the rain contours in the 3-h rain 3B42 (computed from TRMM and other data) to AMSU-B depressions in BT. Overall, AMSU-B shows better skill in delineating the structure of clouds and rain in WDs.</p>

				<title>Aerosol optical depths at Mohal-Kullu in the northwestern Indian Himalayan high altitude station during ICARB</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0041-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>First time observations of spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) at Mohal (31.9&#176;N, 77.11&#176;E; altitude 1154m amsl) in the Kullu valley, located in the northwestern Indian Himalayan region, have been carried out during Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (ICARB), as a part of the Indian Space Research Organisation–Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISRO–GBP). AODs at six wavelengths are obtained using Microtops-II Sunphotometer and Ozonometer. The monthly mean values of AOD at 500 nm are found to be 0.27 ± 0.04 and 0.24 ± 0.02 during March and April, 2006 respectively. However, their monthly mean values are 0.33 ± 0.04 at 380 nm and 0.20 ± 0.03 nm at 870 nm during March 2006 and 0.31 ± 0.3 at 380 nm and 0.17 ± 0.2 at 870 nm during April 2006, showing a gradual decrease in AOD with wavelength. The ˚Angstrom wavelength exponent '𝛼' had a mean value of 0.72 ± 0.05, implying reduced dominance of fine particles. Further, the afternoon AOD values are higher as compared to forenoon values by ∼33.0% during March and by ∼9.0% during April 2006 and are attributed to the pollutant lifted up from the valley by the evolving boundary layer. Besides the long-range transportation of aerosol particles by airmass from the Great Sahara and the Thar Desert regions to the observing site, the high values of AODs have also been influenced by biomass burning and frequent incidents of forest fire at local levels.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0049-0059</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tropopause height and tropopause temperature are sensitive to temperature changes in troposphere and stratosphere. These are the measures of global climatic variability. Atmospheric profiles of temperature, refractivity and water vapour are always needed for communication, navigation and atmospheric modeling studies. The tropopause characteristics over the Indian region have been studied using radio occultation measurements (CHAMP) on the basis of cold point criterion. Tropopause height shows large variation in the latitude range ∼30&#176; $–$40&#176;N during winter. Tropopause temperature less than $−$82&#176;C, assumed to facilitate troposphere to stratosphere air transport, is observed at a number of tropical Indian locations and no seasonal pattern is observed in its occurrence. The bias in temperature and refractivity deduced from radiosonde and radio occultation measurements is also presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface layer meteorological data collected at a coastal site, at Vasco-Da-Gama (15&#176; 21&#8242;N, 73&#176; 51&#8242;E, 58.5m MSL) (13–18 July, 2002) with prevailing southwesterly surface winds are analyzed to study the characteristics of internal boundary layer at a short fetch using an instrumented tower (9 m). The spectral and turbulence characteristics of wind are compared with earlier measurements made at a comparatively homogeneous terrain and the standards available in literature. The study show the smaller eddies in the vertical velocity spectrum attains equilibrium with the underlying surface at a short fetch itself and follows spectral similarity. However, this is not followed by longitudinal and transverse velocity spectra under unstable as well as stable conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study presents shear wave splitting analysis results observed at ISP (Isparta)broadband station in the Isparta Angle,southwestern Turkey.We selected 21 good quality seismic events out of nearly 357 earthquakes and calculated splitting parameters (polarization direction of fast wave, 𝜙 and delay time between fast and slow waves, $\delta t$) from mainly SKS and a few SKKS phases of the selected 21 seismic events. Then, we compared calculated splitting parameters at ISP station (56&#176; &#8804; 𝜙 &#8804; 205&#176; ; 0.37s &#8804; 𝛿 t &#8804; 4s) with those previously calculated at ANTO (Ankara) and ISK (˙Istanbul)stations (27&#176; &#8804; 𝜙 &#8804; 59&#176;; 0.6s &#8804; 𝛿 t &#8804; 2.4s and 26&#176; &#8804; 𝜙 &#8804; 54&#176; ;0.6s &#8804; 𝛿 t &#8804; 1.5s) which are located at 230 and 379 km away from ISP station in central and northwestern Turkey, respectively.The backazimuthal variations of the splitting parameters at ISP station indicate a different and complex mantle polarization anisotropy for the Isparta Angle in southwestern Turkey compared to those obtained for Ankara and Īstanbul stations.</p>

				<title>Magnetic anomalies across Bastar craton and Pranhita–Godavari basin in south of central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0081-0087</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aeromagnetic anomalies over Bastar craton and Pranhita –Godavari (P –G)basin in the south of  central India could be attributed to NW –SE striking maﬁc intrusives in both the areas at variable depths.Such intrusions can be explained considering the collision of the Bastar and Dharwar cratons by the end of the Archaean and the development of tensile regimes that followed in the Paleoproterozoic,facilitating intrusions of maﬁc dykes into the continental crust.The P –G basin  area,being a zone of crustal weakness along the contact of the Bastar and Dharwar cratons, also experienced extensional tectonics.The inferred remanent magnetization of these dykes dips upwards and it is such that the dykes are oriented towards the east of the magnetic north at the time of their formation compared to their present NW –SE strike.Assuming that there was no imprint of magnetization of a later date,it is concluded that the Indian plate was located in the southern hemisphere,either independently or as part of a supercontinent,for some span of time during Paleoproterozoic and was involved in complex path of movement and rotation subsequently.  The paper presents a case study of the utility of aeromagnetic anomalies in qualitatively deducing the palaeopositions of the landmasses from the interpreted remanent magnetism of buried intrusive bodies.</p>

				<title>Trace fossils from the Talchir carbonate concretions, Giridih Basin, Jharkhand</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0089-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The carbonate concretions occurring at the bottom of Talchir ﬁssile shale facies preserved signatures of various trace fossils along with a cast of doubtful organisms and cyanobacterial mat structures. The host shale deposited under glacial melt water fed lacustrine condition.The concretions,formed in poorly oxygenated conditions,are either of syndepositional origin and/or deposited a little below the sediment water interface and were later exhumed to the depositional surface due to erosion of soft mud overlying them.</p>
					<p>The trace fossils are both megascopic and microscopic in nature.The megascopic trace fossils are identiﬁed on the basis of their morphology as <i>Monocraterion</i> and <i>Rhizocorallium</i>. Some of the megascopic structures described remain problematic at present.The microscopic trace fossils are formed due to the activity of marine meiofauna (possibly by nematodes),which,although produced morphologically show similar traces of known larger ichnogeneras but much smaller than them. The discovery of these trace fossils apparently indicate the in ﬂux of saline water into a lacustrine domain during the Talchir sedimentation at Giridih basin.Moreover, presence of the above two megascopic trace fossils in the marine lacustrine carbonate concretions may lead researchers to consider their much wider environmental signiﬁcance than hitherto believed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A completely new set of formulas,based on matrix algebra,has been suggested for the calculation of  the CIPW norm for igneous rocks to achieve highly consistent and accurate norms.The suggested sequence of derivation of the normative minerals greatly deviates from the sequence followed in the classical scheme.The formulas are presented in a form convenient for error-free implementation in computer programs.Accurate formulas along with the use of variable molecular weights for CaO and FeO;corrected formula weights for apatite,pyrite and ﬂuorite;and suggested measures to avoid signiﬁcant rounding off errors to achieve absolute match between the sum of the input weights of the oxides and the sum of the weights of the estimated normative minerals.Using an analogous procedure for determining the oxidation ratios of igneous rocks as used in the SINCLAS system of Ver ma <i>et al</i> (2002,2003),the suggested calculation scheme exactly reproduces their results except for apatite for reasons explained in the text,but with a superior match between the totals for about 11,200 analyses representing rocks of a wide range of composition.</p>

				<title>Summer monsoon onset over Kerala: New definition and prediction</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>The summer monsoon onset over Kerala (MOK)marks the beginning of the rainy season for the country.Associated with the MOK,signiﬁcant transitions of large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns are observed over the Asia –Paciﬁc region.In this study,a new method for the objective identiﬁcation of MOK,based on large scale circulation features and rainfall over Kerala,is discussed.Further,a set of empirical models based on the principal component regression (PCR)technique was developed for the prediction of the date of MOK by keeping in mind the IMD ’s operational forecasting service requirements.Predictors for the models were derived using correlation analysis from the thermal,convective and circulation patterns.Only ﬁve predictors pertaining to the second half of April were used in the ﬁrst model (Model-1)so that the prediction of MOK can be prepared by the end of April itself.The second model (Model-2)used four additional predictors pertaining up to the ﬁrst half of May along with two predictors used in the Model-1 for update prediction at the end of the ﬁrst half of May.To develop each of the PCR models, Principal Components Analysis (PCA)of the respective predictor data was carried out followed by regression analysis of ﬁrst two principal components (PCs)with the date of MOK.Both these models showed good skill in predicting the date of MOK during the independent test period of 1997 –2007.The root mean square error (RMSE)of the predictions from both the models during the independent test period was about four days which was nearly half the RMSE of the predictions based on climatology.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study linear genetic programming (LGP),which is a variant of Genetic Programming,and two versions of Neural Networks (NNs)are used in predicting time-series of daily ﬂow rates at a station on Schuylkill River at Berne,PA,USA.Daily ﬂow rate at present is being predicted based on different time-series scenarios.For this purpose,various LGP and NN models are calibrated with training sets and validated by testing sets.Additionally,the robustness of the proposed LGP and NN models are evaluated by application data,which are used neither in training nor at testing stage.The results showed that both techniques predicted the ﬂow rate data in quite good agreement with the observed ones,and the predictions of LGP and NN are challenging.The performance of LGP,which was moderately better than NN,is very promising and hence supports the use of LGP in predicting of river ﬂow data.</p>

					<p>Suspended particulate matter (SPM)of surface seawaters was collected during December 2003 to October 2004 at 10 stations in the Bay of Bengal,and analyzed for particulate organic carbon (POC),total particulate nitrogen (TPN),total particulate carbohydrate (TPCHO)and total particulate uronic acids (TPURA).The concentrations of POC,TPCHO and TPURA varied from 4.80 to 29.12,0.85 to 4.24,0.09 to 0.91 𝜇 C,respectively.The TPCHO-C and TPURA-C accounted for 6.6 –32.5%and 0.87 –3.65%of POC.The trends observed for the distribution of these compounds were generally similar to those recorded for the distribution of chlorophyll 𝑎 (Chl 𝑎) .The C/N ratios varied from 3.2 to 22.3 with most of the values being &gt; 10.This suggests that the organic matter was mostly derived from phytoplankton and bacteria.Relatively low C/N ratios and high TPCHO yield imply that freshly derived organic matter was present during SWM and FIM.Our data suggest that the quality and quantity of organic matter varied spatially and seasonally.</p>

				<title>Coral microatoll as geodetic tool in North Andaman and Little Andaman, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0157-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coral microatolls were examined from North Andaman and Little Andaman to understand the relative sea level change due to vertical tectonic deformation above the subduction interface.The highest level of survival of coral microatoll before the 26 December,2004 earthquake at eastern coast of North Andaman has been determined by Global Ocean Tide Model.The present position of recently dead ﬂat top microatoll with preserved internal structure at the eastern coast of North Andaman mainland indicates 31.21 cm uplift due to the 26 December,2004 earthquake.Comparatively old cup shaped microatoll at the eastern fringe of North Andaman group of islands and highly bioeroded fossil microatolls at the intertidal zone of Little Andaman bear the signature of permanent vertical deformation in the past.</p>

				<title>Some observations from radiometric ‘8 bit’ data of sediment thin sections based on alternative petrographic image analysis method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0163-0173</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the experiment of sediment microstructure analysis especially microfabric mapping by digital imaging.For that purpose the greyscale images (Red band from RGB combination)of the thin sections have been prepared from the selected 12 samples.The basis of this mapping is the reﬂectance capacity of different sediments which is inﬂuenced by the physical parameters like grain size and colour.The reﬂectances of different sediments are represented in digital format by different DN values from 0 –255 within the radiometric ranges of ‘8 bit ’data. Density slicing has been chosen as the method of microstructure mapping in this research.This study shows that lower DN values normally present dark coloured coarser sand and clay while higher DN values present light coloured ﬁner sediment samples.In the selected samples for this study the maximum DN value has been found from micaceous materials.Another remarkable thing observed from the microfabric mapping is that the presence of coarser sediments forms complex microfabric pattern than the ﬁner sediments in the study area.Though this method have some demerits,still its simple technique can be very useful for accurate microstructure analysis.</p>

				<title>Equatorial modes observed in atmospheric variables</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0181-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wavenumber –frequency spectral analysis of different atmospheric variables has been carried out using 25 years of data.The area considered is the tropical belt 25&#176;S $–$25&#176;N. A combined FFT- wavelet analysis method has been used for this purpose.Variables considered are outgoing long- wave radiation (OLR),850 hPa divergence,zonal and meridional winds at 850,500 and 200 hPa levels,sea level pressure and 850 hPa geopotential height.It is shown that the spectra of different variables have some common properties,but each variable also has few features different from the rest. While Kelvin mode is prominent in OLR and zonal winds,it is not clearly observed in pressure and geopotential height ﬁelds;the latter two have a dominant wavenumber zero mode not seen in other variables except in meridional wind at 200 hPa and 850 hPa divergences.Different dominant modes in the tropics show signiﬁcant variations on sub-seasonal time scales.</p>

				<title>A diagnosis of rainfall over South America during 1997/98 El Niño and 1998/99 La Niña events: Comparison between TRMM PR and GPCP rainfall estimates</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0193-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comparison between TRMM PR rainfall estimates and rain gauge data from ANEEL and combined gauge/satellite data from GPCP over South America (SA)is made.In general,the annual and seasonal regional characteristics of rainfall over SA are qualitatively well reproduced by TRMM PR and GPCP.It is found that over most of SA GPCP exceeds TRMM PR rainfall.The largest positive differences between GPCP and TRMM PR data occur in the north SA,northwestern and central Amazonia.However,there are regions where GPCP rainfall is lower than TRMM PR,particularly in the Paciﬁc coastal regions and in southern Brazil.We suggest that the cause for the positive differences GPCP minus TRMM PR rainfall are related to the fact that satellite observations based on infrared radiation and outgoing longwave radiance sensors overestimate convective rainfall in GPCP and the cause for the negative differences are due to the random errors in TRMM PR.Rainfall differences in the latter phases of the 1997/98 El Ni ˜no and 1998/99 La Ni ˜na are analyzed.The results showed that the rainfall anomalies are generally higher in GPCP than in TRMM PR,however,as in the mean annual case,there are regions where the rainfall in GPCP is lower than in TRMM PR.The higher positive (negative)differences between the rainfall anomalies in GPCP and TRMM PR,which occur in the central Amazonia (southern Brazil),are reduced (increased) in the El Ni ˜no event.This is due to the fact that during the El Ni ˜no episode the rainfall decreases in the central Amazonia and increases in the southern Brazil.Consequently,the overestimation of the convective rainfall by GPCP is reduced and the overestimation of the rainfall by TRMM PR is increased in these two regions,respectively.</p>

				<title>Quasi-periodic VLF emissions observed during daytime at a low latitude Indian ground station Jammu</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0209-0216</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports quasi-periodic pulsing hiss emissions recorded during daytime in the frequency range of 50 Hz –15 kHz at low latitude station Jammu (geomag.lat.=22&#176; 26&#8242;N; 𝐿 =1.17). It is noted that pulsing VLF emissions are a rare phenomena at low latitudes.The various spectrograms of pulsing VLF hiss emissions presented in this paper clearly show band limited spectrums regularly pulsing with almost equal period of the order of few seconds in the frequency range of ∼3-8 kHz. Generation and propagation mechanism of these emissions are brieﬂy discussed.</p>

				<title>Appraisal of groundwater resources in an island condition</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0217-0229</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A group of 36 coral islands is being scattered in the Arabian Sea of the western coast of India. On such islands,groundwater is the only source of fresh water for the islanders.The demand for groundwater is increasing every year due to growing population and urbanization.On the other side the peculiar hydrologic,geologic and geomorphic features restrict the availability of groundwater. Thus a proper understanding of the groundwater condition is important in order to meet this increasing demand and also to formulate future development and management strategies.Detailed hydrogeological,geophysical and hydrochemical studies had been carried out to identify potential fresh groundwater resources and quantify vulnerable parts of Andrott Island,Union Territory of Lakshadweep.Systematic collection and analysis of hydrological,geophysical and hydrochemical data gives an early signal of deterioration in groundwater quality in the peripheral parts of eastern and western coasts of this island and it suggests immediate measures for arresting the deterioration in groundwater quality as well as augmentation for restoration of aquifer in some parts of the island.</p>

				<title>Tectonic controls on the geomorphic evolution of alluvial fans in the Piedmont Zone of Ganga Plain, Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0245-0259</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Piedmont Zone is the least studied part of the Ganga Plain.The northern limit of the Piedmont Zone is deﬁned by the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT)along which the Himalaya is being thrust over the alluvium of the Ganga Plain.Interpretation of satellite imagery,Digital Terrain Models (DTMs)and ﬁeld data has helped in the identiﬁcation and mapping of various morpho-tectonic features in the densely forested and cultivated Piedmont Zone in the Kumaun region of the Uttarakhand state of India.The Piedmont Zone has formed as a result of coalescing alluvial fans,alluvial aprons and talus deposits.The fans have differential morphologies and aggradation processes within a common climatic zone and similar litho-tectonic setting of the catchment area. Morphotectonic analysis reveals that the fan morphologies and aggradation processes in the area are mainly controlled by the ongoing tectonic activities.Such activities along the HFT and transverse faults have controlled the accommodation space by causing differential subsidence of the basin,and aggradation processes by causing channel migration,channel incision and shifting of depocentres.The active tectonic movements have further modiﬁed the landscape of the area in the form of tilted alluvial fan,gravel ridges,terraces and uplifted gravels.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Repeated measurements of the total geomagnetic ﬁeld on the ﬁve proﬁles have revealed a picture of stress-induced tectonomagnetic effect in the form of secular variation of the total geomagnetic ﬁeld in the tectonically and seismically active area of Jabalpur and adjoining areas of the Narmada-Son lineament (NSL),central India.For this experiment,a reference base station was established within the study area at Jabalpur.Using proton precession magnetometers with a sensitivity of 0.1 nT, simultaneous measurements of total geomagnetic ﬁeld were made annually at the base and all ﬁeld stations.Five cycles of repeated observations have been performed between 2003 and 2007.For data analysis,a difference method has been applied and the residuals have been calculated as secular variations of the total geomagnetic ﬁeld with values ranging from ± 0.1nT to about &gt; ± 14.6$nT/yr$ over the different stations.The anomalies in secular variation of the total geomagnetic ﬁeld may be related to anomalous accumulation of tectonic stresses and tensions on the deep fault zones and crustal blocks due to recent geodynamic processes and active geological inhomogeneities in the NSL.</p>

				<title>Weakening of lower tropospheric temperature gradient between Indian landmass and neighbouring oceans and its impact on Indian monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study shows that in the scenario of global warming temperature gradient (TG) between Indian landmass and Arabian Sea/Bay of Bengal is significantly decreasing in the lower troposphere with maxima around 850 hPa. TG during pre-monsoon (March to May) is reducing at a significant rate of 0.036&#176;/year (Arabian Sea) and 0.030&#176;/year (Bay of Bengal). The above alarming results are based on sixty years (1948–2007) of daily temperature and wind data extracted from CDAS-NCEP/NCAR reanalysis datasets. TG based on ERA-40 data also indicates a decreasing trend of 0.0229&#176;/year and 0.0397&#176;/year for Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal respectively. As TG is not governed by any type of significant oscillation, there is a possibility of TG tending to zero. It is further observed that the rate of warming over the oceans is more than that over the land which has resulted into the weakening of TG. Pre-monsoon TG has significant correlations with</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All India Seasonal Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR),</li>
						<li>kinetic energy of waves 1 and 2 at 850 hPa,</li>
						<li>kinetic energy, and</li>
						<li>stream function at 850 hPa over Indian landmass during monsoon season.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Except AISMR, the decreasing trends observed in all the above parameters are significant. All India rainfall for July and August together shows a significant decreasing trend of 0.995mm/year. Reducing number of depressions and cyclonic storms and increasing number of break days during monsoon over India are the reflections of the weakening of TG.</p>

				<title>A case study of atmospheric boundary layer features during winter over a tropical inland station – Kharagpur (22.32&#176;N, 87.32&#176;E)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0281-0293</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The local weather and air quality over a region are greatly influenced by the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) structure and dynamics. ABL characteristics were measured using a tethered balloon-sonde system over Kharagpur (22.32&#176;N, 87.32&#176;E, 40m above MSL), India, for the period 7 December 2004 to 30 December 2004, as a part of the Indian Space Research Organization– Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISRO–GBP) Aerosol Land Campaign II. High-resolution data of pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction were archived along with surface layer measurements using an automatic weather station. This paper presents the features of ABL, like ABL depth and nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) depth. The sea surface winds from Quikscat over the oceanic regions near the experiment site were analyzed along with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis winds over Kharagpur to estimate the convergence of wind, moisture and vorticity to understand the observed variations in wind speed and relative humidity, and also the increased aerosol concentrations. The variation of ventilation coefficient (<i>VC</i>), a factor determining the air pollution potential over a region, is also discussed in detail.</p>

				<title>Mesoscale model simulation of low level equatorial winds over Borneo during the haze episode of September 1997</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0295-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The large-scale vegetation fires instigated by the local farmers during the dry period of the major El Ni˜no event in 1997 can be considered as one of the worst environmental disasters that have occurred in southeast Asia in recent history. This study investigated the local meteorology characteristics of an equatorial environment within a domain that includes the northwestern part of Borneo from the 17 to 27 September 1997 during the height of the haze episode by utilizing a limited area three-dimensional meteorological and dispersion model, The Air Pollution Model (TAPM).</p>
					<p>Daily land and sea breeze conditions near the northwestern coast of Borneo in the state ofSarawak, Malaysia were predicted with moderate success by the index of agreement of less than one between the observed and simulated values for wind speed and a slight overprediction of 2.3 of the skill indicator that evaluates the standard deviation to the observed values. The innermost domain of study comprises an area of 24,193 km<sup>2</sup>, from approximately 109&#176;E to 111&#176;E, and from 1&#176;N to 2.3&#176;N, which includes a part of the South China Sea. Tracer analysis of air particles that were sourced in the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo verified the existence of the landward and shoreward movements of the air during the simulation of the low level wind field. Polluted air particles were transported seawards during night-time, and landwards during daytime, highlighting the recirculation features of aged and newer air particles during the length of eleven days throughout the model simulation. Near calm conditions at low levels were simulated by the trajectory analysis from midnight to mid-day on the 22 of September 1997. Low-level turbulence within the planetary boundary layer in terms of the total kinetic energy was weak, congruent with the weak strength of low level winds that reduced the ability of the air to transport the pollutants.</p>
					<p>Statistical evaluation showed that parameters such as the systematic RMSE and unsystematic RMSE between the observed and simulated values indicated the modest skill of the model in simulating the low level winds. Otherwise, the equatorial meteorological parameters such as wind speed and temperature were successfully simulated by the model with comparatively high correlation coefficients, lower RMSEs and moderately high indices of agreement with observed values.</p>

				<title>Track prediction of very severe cyclone ‘Nargis’ using high resolution weather research forecasting (WRF) model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0309-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recent very severe cyclonic storm (VSCS) ‘Nargis’ over the Bay of Bengal caused widespread destruction over Myanmar after hitting the coast on 2 May 2008. The real time forecasting of the VSCS ‘Nargis’ was a very difficult task as it did not follow the normal westerly/northwesterly track. In the present study, a detailed diagnostic analysis of the system ‘Nargis’ is carried out initially to investigate the features associated with this unusual movement and subsequently the real time forecast of VSCS ‘Nargis’ using high resolution advanced version weather research forecasting (WRF) model is presented. The advanced research WRF model was run for 72 h at 27 km and 20 km resolutions with 28, 29, 30 April and 1 May as the initial conditions. The diagnostic study indicates that the recurvature of the system ‘Nargis’ was mainly associated with:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>upper level southerly/southwesterly steering wind at 200 hPa level associated with anticyclonic circulation over southeastern sector of the centre of the system,</li>
						<li>higher SST (29&#176;C or more) with higher positive anomalies over the region to the northeast of the cyclone centre, and</li>
						<li>large negative 24 h pressure changes and large vorticity maximum to the east of the system.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The real time track forecast using theWRF model run at 27 km and 20 km resolution based on the initial conditions of 28 April (when the system was only 550 km away from the Indian coast) indicated that the system had a northeasterly forecast track and was not expected to cross the Indian coast. Similarly, based on 29 April initial condition the system showed east/east-northeasterly movement towards the Myanmar coast. The east/east-northeasterly movement of the ‘Nargis’ was persisting in the forecast based on 30 April and 1 May initial conditions with respective landfall errors of 85 km and 50 km with 27 km resolution, which reduces to 30 km and 40 km respectively with  20 km resolution, however, with a landfall time delay of about 10 h. Improvement of mean forecast errors at different forecast hours is noticed in WRF model run at higher resolution compared to that run at lower resolution. Thus, it is very clear that the advanced version WRF model had captured movement of the system reasonably well almost 3 days in advance. Consistence with the diagnostic analysis the WRF model forecast also indicates southerly/southwesterly strong steering wind at 200 hPa level and maximum pressure fall to the east of the system.</p>

				<title>Polarized microwave forward model simulations for tropical storm Fanoos</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0331-0343</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, forward radiative transfer simulations are carried out for the tropical cyclone <i>Fanoos</i> that hit the coast off south India in December 2005. The in-house radiative transfer package used for this study employs the doubling and adding method to calculate radiances leaving the top of the one dimensional precipitating atmosphere. The particle drop size distribution is assumed to follow a modified gamma distribution in respect of the cloud liquid water and cloud ice water content. For precipitation, the Marshall–Palmer particle size distribution is used. All the hydrometeor particles are assumed to be spherical and Lorentz Mie theory is used to evaluate the interaction parameters like absorption, scattering coefficients and polarized scattering matrix. In order to validate the drop size distributions and interaction parameter calculations, the simulated brightness temperatures are compared with the TMI measured brightness temperatures for all the channels. For carrying out this exercise, vertical hydrometeors retrieved by TMI are used as input. The differences between simulated and measured brightness temperatures are found to be within ± 10%. The maximum difference in the brightness temperatures between the present work and the Eddington model which the TRMM algorithm employs is about 4.5K. This may become significant when retrieval of precipitation is attempted by combining the forward model with a suitable retrieval strategy, under tropical conditions.</p>

				<title>Comparison of two split-window methods for retrieving land surface temperature from MODIS data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0345-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in environment and earth science study, especially for monitoring drought. The objective of this work is a comparison of two split-window methods: Mao method and Sobrino method, for retrieving LST using MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data in North China Plain. The results show that the max, min and mean errors of Mao method are 1.33K, 1.54K and 0.13K lower than the standard LST product respectively; while those of Sobrino method are 0.73K, 1.46K and 1.50K higher than the standard respectively. Validation of the two methods using LST product based on weather stations shows a good agreement between the standard and Sobrino method, with RMSE of 1.17K, whereas RMSE of Mao method is 1.85K. Finally, the study introduces the Sobmao method, which is based on Sobrino method but simplifies the estimation of atmospheric water vapour content using Mao method. The Sobmao method has almost the same accuracy with Sobrino method. With high accuracy and simplification of water vapour content estimation, the Sobmao method is recommendable in LST inversion for good application in Ningxia region, the northwest China, with mean error of 0.33K and the RMSE value of 0.91K.</p>

				<title>SCS-CN and GIS-based approach for identifying potential water harvesting sites in the Kali Watershed, Mahi River Basin, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0355-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kali sub-watershed is situated in the semi-arid region of Gujarat, India and forms a part of the Mahi River Watershed. This watershed receives an average annual rainfall of 900mm mainly between July and September. Due to high runoff potential, evapo-transpiration and poor infiltration, drought like situation prevails in this area from December to June almost every year. In this paper, augmentation of water resource is proposed by construction of runoff harvesting structures like check dam, percolation pond, farm pond, well and subsurface dyke. The site suitability for different water harvesting structures is determined by considering spatially varying parameters like runoff potential, slope, fracture pattern and micro-watershed area. GIS is utilised as a tool to store, analyse and integrate spatial and attribute information pertaining to runoff, slope, drainage and fracture. The runoff derived by SCS-CN method is a function of runoff potential which can be expressed in terms of runoff coefficient (ratio between the runoff and rainfall) which can be classified into three classes, viz., high (&lt; 40%), moderate (20–40%) and low (&gt; 20%). In addition to IMSD, FAO specifications for water harvesting/recharging structures, parameters such as effective storage, rock mass permeability are herein considered to augment effective storage. Using the overlay and decision tree concepts in GIS, potential water harvesting sites are identified. The derived sites are field investigated for suitability and implementation. In all, the accuracy of the site selection at implementation level varies from 80–100%.</p>

				<title>Wind-driven estuarine turbidity maxima in Mandovi Estuary, central west coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0369-0377</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Systematic studies on the suspended particulate matter (SPM) measured on a seasonal cycle in the Mandovi Estuary, Goa indicate that the average concentrations of SPM at the regular station are ∼20mg/l, 5mg/l, 19mg/l and 5mg/l for June–September, October–January, February–April and May, respectively. SPM exhibits low-to-moderate correlation with rainfall indicating that SPM is also influenced by other processes. Transect stations reveal that the SPM at sea-end stations of the estuary are at least two orders of magnitude greater than those at the river-end during the monsoon. Estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) of nearly similar magnitude occurs at the same location in two periods, interrupted by a period with very low SPM concentrations. The ETM occurring in June–September is associated with low salinities; its formation is attributed to the interactions between strong southwesterly winds ($5.1–5.6ms^{−1}$) and wind-induced waves and tidal currents and, dominant easterly river flow at the mouth of the estuary. The ETM occurring in February–April is associated with high salinity and is conspicuous. The strong NW and SW winds ($3.2–3.7ms^{−1}$) and wind-driven waves and currents seem to have acted effectively at the mouth of the estuary in developing turbidity maximum. The impact of sea breeze appears nearly same as that of trade winds and cannot be underestimated in sediment resuspension and deposition.</p>

				<title>Deformation mechanisms in the frontal Lesser Himalayan Duplex in Sikkim Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0379-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding deformation mechanisms in Himalayan rocks is a challenging proposition due to the complex nature of the deformed rocks and their genesis. Crustal deformation in the Himalayan thrust belt typically occurs in elastico-frictional (EF) or quasi-plastic (QP) regimes at depths controlled mainly by regional strain-rate and geothermal gradient. However, material property, grain-size and their progressive changes during deformation are also important controlling factors. We present evidence of EF deformation from Gondwana rocks developed during the emplacement of one of the frontal horses (Jorthang horse) in the Lesser Himalayan Duplex (LHD) structure associated with Lesser Himalayan rocks in the footwall of the Ramgarh thrust in the Rangit window near Jorthang in the Sikkim Himalaya. The rocks in the horse exhibit systematic changes in microand meso-structures from an undeformed protolith to cataclasite suggesting that it was emplaced under elastico-frictional conditions. Meso- to micro-scale shear fractures are seen developed in Gondwana sandstone and slate while intercalated fine-grained shale-coal-carbonates are deformed by cataclastic flow suggesting that material property and grain-size have played an important role in the deformation of the Jorthang horse. In contrast, the hanging wall schists and quartzites of the Ramgarh thrust exhibit quasi-plastic deformation structures. This suggests that the Jorthang horse was emplaced under shallower crustal conditions than the antiformally folded Ramgarh thrust sheet even though the Ramgarh sheet presently overlies the Jorthang horse.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0391-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thermal infrared spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the compositional analysis of geological materials. The spectral feature in the mid-IR region is diagnostic of the mineralogy and spectral signatures of mixtures of minerals that add linearly, and therefore, can be used as an important tool to determine the mineralogy of rocks in the laboratory and remotely for planetary exploration. The greatest challenge in the emission measurement lies in the measurement of the weak thermal photons emitted from geological materials in a laboratory setup, and accurately records the temperature of the rock sample. The present work pertains to the details of a new Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) laboratory that has been developed under the ISRO Planetary Science and Exploration (PLANEX) programme, for emission related mineralogical investigations of planetary surfaces. The focus of the paper is on the acquisition and calibration technique for obtaining emissivity, and the deconvolution procedure to obtain the modal abundances of the thermal emission spectra in the range of 6–25 𝜇 m using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The basic technique is adopted from the work of Ruff <i>et al</i> (1997). This laboratory at the Department of Earth Sciences, IIT-Bombay is currently developing pure end mineral library of mineral particulates (&gt; 65 𝜇m), and adding new end members to the existing ASU spectral library. The paper argues the need for considering Lunar Orbiter Thermal Emission Spectrometer (LOTES) for future Indian Moon mission programme (Chandrayan-II) to determine evidences of varied lithologies on the lunar surface.</p>

				<title>Magnetic anomalies of offshore Krishna-Godavari Basin, eastern continental margin of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0405-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The marine magnetic data acquired from offshore Krishna–Godavari (K–G) basin, eastern continental margin of India (ECMI), brought out a prominent NE–SW trending feature, which could be explained by a buried structural high formed by volcanic activity. The magnetic anomaly feature is also associated with a distinct negative gravity anomaly similar to the one associated with 85&#176;E  Ridge. The gravity low could be attributed to a flexure at the Moho boundary, which could in turn be filled with the volcanic material. Inversion of the magnetic and gravity anomalies was also carried out to establish the similarity of anomalies of the two geological features (structural high on the margin and the 85&#176;E  Ridge) and their interpretations. In both cases, the magnetic anomalies were caused dominantly by the magnetization contrast between the volcanic material and the surrounding oceanic crust, whereas the low gravity anomalies are by the flexures of the order of 3–4 km at Moho boundary beneath them. The analysis suggests that both structural high present in offshore Krishna–Godavari basin and the 85&#176;E  Ridge have been emplaced on relatively older oceanic crust by a common volcanic process, but at discrete times, and that several of the gravity lows in the Bay of Bengal can be attributed to flexures on the Moho, each created due to the load of volcanic material.</p>

				<title>Impact of vegetation on the simulation of seasonal monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent using a regional model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0413-0440</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The change in the type of vegetation fraction can induce major changes in the local effects such as local evaporation,surface radiation,etc.,that in turn induces changes in the model simulated  outputs.The present study deals with the effects of vegetation in climate modeling over the Indian  region using the MM5 mesoscale model.The main objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of vegetation dataset derived from SPOT satellite by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization)<i>versus</i> that of USGS (United States Geological Survey)vegetation dataset on the simulation of the Indian summer monsoon.The present study has been conducted for ﬁve monsoon seasons (1998 –2002),giving emphasis over the two contrasting southwest monsoon seasons of 1998 (normal)and 2002 (deﬁcient).</p>
					<p>The study reveals mixed results on the impact of vegetation datasets generated by ISRO and USGS on the simulations of the monsoon.Results indicate that the ISRO data has a positive impact on the simulations of the monsoon over northeastern India and along the western coast.The MM5- USGS has greater tendency of overestimation of rainfall.It has higher standard deviation indicating that it induces a dispersive effect on the rainfall simulation.Among the ﬁve years of study,it is seen that the RMSE of July and JJAS (June –July –August –September)for All India Rainfall is mostly lower for MM5-ISRO.Also,the bias of July and JJAS rainfall is mostly closer to unity for MM5-ISRO.The wind ﬁelds at 850 hPa and 200 hPa are also better simulated by MM5 using ISRO vegetation.The synoptic features like Somali jet and Tibetan anticyclone are simulated closer to the veri ﬁcation analysis by ISRO vegetation.The 2 m air temperature is also better simulated by ISRO vegetation over the northeastern India,showing greater spatial variability over the region. However,the JJAS total rainfall over north India and Deccan coast is better simulated using the USGS vegetation.Sensible heat ﬂux over north-west India is also better simulated by MM5-USGS.</p>

				<title>The interaction of large scale and mesoscale environment leading to formation of intense thunderstorms over Kolkata. Part I: Doppler radar and satellite observations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0441-0466</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The weather systems that predominantly affect the eastern and northeastern parts of India during the pre-monsoon summer months (March,April and May)are severe thunderstorms,known as Nor ’westers.The storms derive their names from the fact that they frequently strike cities and towns in the southern part of West Bengal in the afternoon from the north-west direction while traveling far from its place of genesis over the Bihar plateau.The storms are devastating in nature particularly due to strong (gusty)winds,heavy rains and hails associated with it.Although these storms are well known for its power of causing damages,studies on them are relatively few due to their small  size and sparse network of observations.To address this important issue,the evolution of two Nor ’westers of 12 March and 22 May 2003 over Kolkata is studied in detail in this paper using hourly Doppler weather radar (DWR)observations and high resolution Meteosat-5 imageries.In addition,supporting meteorological reports are used to ﬁnd the large scale conditions that inﬂuence the moisture convergence and vertical wind shear.The genesis of both the storms is found to be over Bihar –Jharkhand region and beyond the range of the DWR.The satellite observations are found to be useful in identifying the location and initiation of the storms.The movements of the storms are captured by the DWR estimated vertical cross-section of reﬂectivities.The Doppler estimate shows that the 12 March storm had a vertical extent of about 10 –12 km at the time of maturity and that of 22 May reaching up to 18 km signifying deep convection associated with these events.The genesis, maturity and dissipation are well brought out by the hourly DWR and satellite imageries.The DWR observations suggest that the systems move at a speed of 20 –25 m/s.The DWR estimated precipitation shows a detailed spatial distribution around Kolkata with several localized zones of heavy rain and this is found to be well supported by the nearby station observations.This study establishes that DWR observations along with hourly satellite imageries are able to capture the evolution of Nor ’westers.The study also shows that the composite DWR-satellite information is a reliable tool for nowcasting the location,time and path of movement of Nor ’westers.Based on these observations,a conceptual model of the Nor ’wester is proposed.</p>

				<title>A study of lightning activity over land and oceanic regions of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0467-0481</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monthly variations of lightning activity over typical land and oceanic regions of India were  examined using satellite data (OTD)for a 5-year period (1995-1999).It is noted that the nature of variation between surface air maximum temperature (𝑇_max) ,thunderstorm days (Th_n) ,and lightning ﬂash count over ER and WR showed remarkable correspondence and sensitivity with each other on monthly time scale.As we move out of winter season and enter the monsoon season,via pre-monsoon season,the WR undergoes cooling relative to the ER in the range 0.1-1.2&#176;C. As a result,WR experiences reduction of thunder days and lowering in ﬂash count. This decrease in 𝑇_max Th_{n} and ﬂash count over WR may also be associated with relatively small values of 𝑇<sub>𝜃 w</sub> and CAPE in comparison with similar values over ER during the monsoon sea-son.Our observation of associated reduction in Th_n and lightning count per 1&#176;C cooling in surface air maximum temperature suggests reduction of ∼3.5 thunderstorms per station and 73 ﬂashes. Comparison of lightning ﬂashes between pairs of coastal,oceanic,arid-zone,hilly,and island stations reveals distinct relationship between climate regime and intensity of lightning activity. We may conclude the results of this study by saying that the overhead lightning activity is a clear reﬂection of the status of the underlying ground-earth properties. A close and continuous monitoring of lightning activity may be considered as a need of present day scientiﬁc studies.</p>

				<title>On the diurnal ranges of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the north Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0483-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the variability in the diurnal range of SST in the north Indian Ocean using <i>in situ</i> measurements and tests the suitability of simple regression models in estimating the diurnal range.SST measurements obtained from 1556 drifting and 25 moored buoys were used to determine the diurnal range of SSTs.The magnitude of diurnal range of SST was highest in spring and lowest in summer monsoon.Except in spring,nearly 75 –80%of the observations reported diurnal range below 0.5&#176;C.The distributions of the magnitudes of diurnal warming across the three basins of north Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea,Bay of Bengal and Equatorial Indian Ocean)were similar except for the  differences between the Arabian Sea and the other two basins during November-February (winter monsoon)and May.The magnitude of diurnal warming that depended on the location of temperature sensor below the water level varied with seasons.In spring,the magnitude of diurnal warming diminished drastically with the increase in the depth of temperature sensor.The diurnal range estimated using the drifting buoy data was higher than the diurnal range estimated using moored buoys ﬁtted with temperature sensors at greater depths.</p>
					<p>A simple regression model based on the peak solar radiation and average wind speed was good enough to estimate the diurnal range of SST at ∼1.0 m in the north Indian Ocean during most of the seasons except under low wind-high solar radiation conditions that occur mostly during spring. The additional information on the rate of precipitation is found to be redundant for the estimation of the magnitude of diurnal warming at those depths.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variation in the biochemical composition of red seaweed (<i>Catenella repens</i>) from Gangetic delta, northeast coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0497-0505</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The biochemical composition of red seaweeds,<i>Catenella repens</i> was investigated in this present study along with subsequent analysis of relevant physico-chemical variables.In this study, the relationship between the nutritive components of this species and the ambient environmental parameters was established.Protein content varied from 2.78 ± 0.30% of dry weight (stn.3)to 16.03 ± 0.96% of dry weight (stn.1) with highest values during monsoon.The protein levels were positively correlated with dissolved nitrate content and negatively correlated with water temperature (except stn.3)and salinity.Carbohydrate content of this species varied signiﬁcantly (𝑝 &gt; 0.05) during pre-monsoon between stations and the values showed positive relationship with salinity and surface water temperature.In contrast to carbo- hydrate,lipid concentration was lowest in values and varied very slightly between seasons and stations.Astaxanthin content of the seaweed species was greater in pre-monsoon than monsoon and post-monsoon in all the selected stations.Compared with the three seasons, samples of red seaweed collected in pre-monsoon has high carbohydrate –astaxanthin in contrast to protein –lipid which showed high values during monsoon.Statistical analysis computed among the environmental and biochemical parameters suggests the potential role played by the abiotic parameters on biosynthetic pathways of seaweed.This paper also highlights the inﬂuence of the nutritional quality of water that can be used for mass cultivation of <i>Catenella repens</i>.</p>

				<title>Groundwater flow modelling of Yamuna–Krishni interstream, a part of central Ganga Plain Uttar Pradesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0507-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groundwater is a major source of water for agricultural and domestic requirements in western Uttar Pradesh.Due to increasing agricultural requirements the abstraction of groundwater has increased manifold in the last two-to-three decades.The quaternary alluvium hosts the aquifer in the region.The study area forms a part of Yamuna –Krishni inter ﬂuve.Although the area hosts potential aquifers these have been adversely affected by poor management.For effective ground water management of a basin it is essential that a careful water balance study should be carried out. Keeping this in mind groundwater ﬂow modelling was attempted to simulate the behaviour of the  ﬂow system and evaluate the water balance.The groundwater ﬂow modelling was carried out.The horizontal ﬂows,seepage losses from unlined canals,recharge from rainfall and irrigation return ﬂows were applied using different boundary packages available in Visual MODFLOW,Pro 4.1. The river aquifer interaction was simulated using the river boundary package.Hydraulic conductivity values were applied to speciﬁc zones and these ranged from 9.8 to 26.6 m/day.Recharge due to rainfall and irrigation returns were assigned to respective zones.Pumping rates of 500 m<sup>3</sup>/day$, 1000 m<sup>3</sup>/day$, 1500 m<sup>3</sup>/day, 2000 m<sup>3</sup>/day and 2500 m<sup>3</sup>/day were applied to appropriate areas of the  model to simulate areas of stress.The zone budget shows a water balance de ﬁcit for the period June 2006 to June 2007. The total recharge to the study area is 160.21 million m<sup>3</sup> (Mcum). The groundwater draft through pumping is of the order of 233.56 Mcum, thus leaving a deﬁcit balance of −73.35 Mcum. The sensitivity of the model to input parameters was tested by varying the parameters of interest over a range of values, monitoring the response of the model and determining the root mean square error of the simulated groundwater heads to the measured heads. These analyses showed that the model is most sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and recharge parameters. Three scenarios were considered to predict aquifer responses under varied conditions of groundwater bstraction.</p>

				<title>Estimation of snow cover distribution in Beas basin, Indian Himalaya using satellite data and ground measurements</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0525-0538</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present paper,a methodology has been developed for the mapping of snow cover in Beas basin,Indian Himalaya using AWiFS (IRS-P6)satellite data.The complexities in the mapping of snow cover in the study area are snow under vegetation,contaminated snow and patchy snow. To overcome these problems,ﬁeld measurements using spectroradiometer were carried out and reﬂectance/snow indices trend were studied.By evaluation and validation of different topographic correction models,it was observed that,the normalized difference snow index (NDSI)values remain constant with the variations in slope and aspect and thus NDSI can take care of topography effects.Different snow cover mapping methods using snow indices are compared to ﬁnd the suitable mapping technique.The proposed methodology for snow cover mapping uses the NDSI (estimated using planetary re ﬂectance),NIR band reﬂectance and forest/vegetation cover information.The satellite estimated snow or non-snow pixel information using proposed methodology was validated with the snow cover information collected at three observatory locations and it was found that the algorithm classify all the sample points correctly,once that pixel is cloud free.The snow cover distribution was estimated using one year (2004 –05)cloud free satellite data and good correlation was observed between increase/decrease areal extent of seasonal snow cover and ground observed fresh snowfall and standing snow data.</p>

					<p>Analytical solutions are obtained for one-dimensional advection –diffusion equation with variable coefficients in a longitudinal ﬁnite initially solute free domain,for two dispersion problems.In the ﬁrst one,temporally dependent solute dispersion along uniform ﬂow in homogeneous domain is studied.In the second problem the velocity is considered spatially dependent due to the inhomogeneity of the domain and the dispersion is considered proportional to the square of the velocity. The velocity is linearly interpolated to represent small increase in it along the ﬁnite domain.This analytical solution is compared with the numerical solution in case the dispersion is proportional to the same linearly interpolated velocity.The input condition is considered continuous of uniform and of increasing nature both.The analytical solutions are obtained by using Laplace transformation technique.In that process new independent space and time variables have been introduced. The effects of the dependency of dispersion with time and the inhomogeneity of the domain on the solute transport are studied separately with the help of graphs.</p>

				<title>Detection of sub-basaltic sediments by a multi-parametric joint inversion approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0551-0562</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In many parts of the world sedimentary horizons with potential for hydrocarbon are located below ﬂood basalt provinces.However,the presence of high velocity basaltic overburden makes delineation of sediments difficult due to the low velocity layer problem.Electrical and electromagnetic methods have been used in such scenarios because of the good electrical conductivity contrast between basalts and underlying sediments.However,mapping of the target sediments becomes difficult when the layer is thin as the data errors due to inherent noise lead to equivalent solutions.To tackle such difficult situations,a joint inversion scheme incorporating seismic reﬂection and refraction, magnetotelluric and deep electrical resistivity datasets is presented. Efficacy of the scheme is tested for a model comprising a thin sedimentary layer sandwiched between a thick basalt cover and a granitic basement.The results indicate that the parameters of the target sedimentary layer are either poorly resolved or equivalent solutions are obtained by the inversion of individual datasets. Joint inversions of seismic reﬂection (RFLS)and refraction (RFRS),or DC and  MT dataset pairs provide improved results and the range of equivalent solutions is narrowed down.Combination of any three of the above datasets leads to further narrowing of this range and improvements in mean model estimates.Joint inversion incorporating all the datasets is found to yield good estimates of the structure.Resolution analysis is carried out to appraise estimates of various model parameters obtained by jointly inverting different combinations of datasets.</p>

				<page>0563-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fully coupled Biot quasi-static theory of linear poroelasticity is used to study the consolidation of a poroelastic half-space caused by axisymmetric surface loads.The ﬂuid and solid constituents of the poroelastic medium are compressible and its permeability in the vertical direction is different from its permeability in the horizontal direction.An analytical solution of the governing equations is obtained by taking the displacements and the pore pressure as the  basic state variables and using a combination of the Laplace and Hankel transforms.The problem of an axisymmetric normal load is discussed in detail.An explicit analytical solution is obtained for normal disc loading.Detailed  numerical computations reveal that the anisotropy in permeability as well as the com-pressibilities of the ﬂuid and solid constituents of the poroelastic medium have signiﬁcant effects on the consolidation of the half-space.The anisotropy in permeability may accelerate the consolidation process and may lead to a dilution in the theoretical prediction of the Mandel –Cryer effect. The compressibility of the solid constituents may also accelerate the consolidation process.</p>

				<page>0575-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A highly diversiﬁed, advanced and exceptionally well preserved microfossil assemblage, dominated by a planktic community,has been recorded from petrographic thin sections of chert belonging to the Sirbu Shale Formation,Bhander group,upper Vindhyans,Rajasthan.Recently, it was noticed that the assemblage also contains well preserved,large-sized acanthomorphic acritarchs, <i>Trachyhystrichosphaera</i> considered to be an age-marker microfossil of the Cryogenian (850 –630 Ma).It is reported for the ﬁrst time from any Indian microfossil assemblage of Proterozoic succession.The other microfossils of the Sirbu Shale Formation are:well preserved simple,small and large-sized sphaeromorphs;complex acanthomorphs,cyanobacterial community;especially a very small-sized but exceptionally well preserved <i>Obruchevella</i> ,a form resembling <i>Volvox</i> colonies; cf.vase-shaped microfossils and morphologies,possibly inclining towards fungal affinity,or lichen- like symbiotic associations of algae and fungi.Till date, <i>Trachyhystrichosphaera</i> has so far not been reported from successions older than the Tonian (1000 –850 Ma).It is believed that acanthomorphs attained maximum size in Ediacaran (630 –542 Ma),and further decreased in size in the Cambrian.The global paleontological literature indicates that <i>Trachyhystrichosphaera</i> ranges in age from Tonian –Ediacaran (1000 –542 Ma).</p>
					<p>The present record of <i>Trachyhystrichosphaera</i> as well as the earlier studies of micro and megascopic life of the Bhander Group in general and the Sirbu Shale in particular (aided by the absence of any  Cambrian fossil record)indicate that in all possibilities,age of the Sirbu Shale should lie near Cryogenian (850 –630 Ma)and the uppermost Bhander group,may incline towards the Ediacaran (630 –542 Ma).</p>

				<title>Application of Markov chain and entropy analysis to lithologic succession – an example from the early Permian Barakar Formation, Bellampalli coalfield, Andhra Pradesh, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0583-0596</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A statistical approach by a modiﬁed Markov process model and entropy function is used to prove that the early Permian Barakar Formation of the Bellampalli coal ﬁeld developed distinct cyclicities during deposition.From results,the transition path of lithological states typical for the Bellampalli basin is as:coarse to medium-grained sandstone $\longrightarrow $ interbedded ﬁne-grained sandstone/shale $\longrightarrow $ shale $\longrightarrow $ coal and again shale.The majority of cycles are symmetrical but asymmetrical cycles are present as well.The chi-square stationarity test implies that these cycles are stationary in space and time.The cycles are interpreted in terms of in-channel,point bar and overbank facies association in a ﬂuvial system.The randomness in the occurrence of facies within a cycle is evaluated in terms of entropy,which can be calculated from the Markov matrices.Two types of entropies are calculated for every facies state;entropy after deposition 𝐸 (post)and entropy before deposition 𝐸(pre),which together form entropy set;the entropy for the whole system is also calculated.These values are plotted and compared with Hattori ’s idealized plots,which indicate that the sequence is essentially  a symmetrical cycle (type-B of Hattroi).</p>
					<p>The symmetrical cyclical deposition of early Permian Barakar Formation is explained by the lateral migration of stream channels in response to varying discharge and rate of deposition across the alluvial plain.In addition,the ﬁning upward cycles in the upper part enclosing thick beds of  ﬁne clastics,as well as coal may represent differential subsidence of depositional basin.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Eco-restoration of mine overburden (OB)or abandoned mine sites is a major environmental concern.In the present investigation,an integrated approach was used to rejuvenate a high-sulphur mine OB dumping site in the Tirap Collieries,Assam,India,which is situated in the Indo-Burma mega-biodiversity hotspot.A mine OB is devoid of true soil character with poor macro and micronutrient content and contains elevated concentrations of trace and heavy metals.Planting of herbs, shrubs,cover crops and tree species at close proximity leads to primary and secondary sere state succession within a period of 3 to 5 years.A variety of plant species were screened for potential use in restoration:herbs,including <i>Sccharum spontaneum, Cymbopogon winterianus</i> Jowitt (citronella), and <i>Cymbopogon flexuosus</i> (lemon grass)cover plants,including <i>Mimosa strigillosa M. striata</i> and <i>M. pigra</i>; shrubs,including <i>Sesbania rostrata</i> (dhaincha)and <i>Cassia streata</i> (cassia);and tree species,including <i>Gmelina arborea</i> (gomari)and <i>Dalbergia sissoo</i> (sissoo).Amendment with unmined soil and bio-organic matter was required for primary establishment of some plant species. Management of these plant species at the site will ensure long term sustainable eco-restoration of the coal mine-degraded land.</p>

				<title>High-resolution satellite image segmentation using Hölder exponents</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0609-0617</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Texture in high-resolution satellite images requires substantial amendment in the conventional segmentation algorithms. A measure is proposed to compute the Hölder exponent (HE) to assess the roughness or smoothness around each pixel of the image. The localized singularity information is incorporated in computing the HE. An optimum window size is evaluated so that HE reacts to localized singularity. A two-step iterative procedure for clustering the transformed HE image is adapted to identify the range of HE, densely occupied in the kernel and to partition Hölder exponents into a cluster that matches with the range. Hölder exponent values (noise or not associated with the other cluster) are clubbed to a nearest possible cluster using the local maximum likelihood analysis.</p>

				<title>Mineralogy and geochemistry of banded iron formation and iron ores from eastern India with implications on their genesis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0619-0641</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geological complexities of banded iron formation (BIF) and associated iron ores of Jilling–Langalata iron ore deposits, Singhbhum–North Orissa Craton, belonging to Iron Ore Group (IOG) eastern India have been studied in detail along with the geochemical evaluation of different iron ores. The geochemical and mineralogical characterization suggests that the massive, hard laminated, soft laminated ore and blue dust had a genetic lineage from BIFs aided with certain input from hydrothermal activity. The PAAS normalized REE pattern of Jilling BIF striking positive Eu anomaly, resembling those of modern hydrothermal solutions from mid-oceanic ridge (MOR). Major part of the iron could have been added to the bottom sea water by hydrothermal solutions derived from hydrothermally active anoxic marine environments. The ubiquitous presence of intercalated tuffaceous shales indicates the volcanic signature in BIF.</p>
					<p>Mineralogical studies reveal that magnetite was the principal iron oxide mineral, whose depositional history is preserved in BHJ, where it remains in the form of martite and the platy hematite is mainly the product of martite. The different types of iron ores are intricately related with the BHJ. Removal of silica from BIF and successive precipitation of iron by hydrothermal fluids of possible meteoric origin resulted in the formation of martite-goethite ore. The hard laminated ore has been formed in the second phase of supergene processes, where the deep burial upgrades the hydrous iron oxides to hematite. The massive ore is syngenetic in origin with BHJ. Soft laminated ores and biscuity ores were formed where further precipitation of iron was partial or absent.</p>

				<title>Petrography, geochemistry and geodynamic environment of potassic alkaline rocks in Eslamy peninsula, northwest of Iran</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0643-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eslamy peninsula, 360 km<sup>2</sup> in area, is located in the eastern coast of Urmieh lake in the northwest of Iran. This peninsula is a complex stratovolcano with a collapsed center, which is elevated due to later intrusions of sub-volcanic masses with trachytic to microsyenitic composition. The composite cone consists of a sequence of leucite tephrite, tephrite, leucite basanite, basanite and related pyroclastic rocks. Magmatic activities in the Eslamy peninsula begin with potassic alkaline to ultrapotassic and basic, silica-undersaturated shoshonitic rocks and they are followed by intrusions of lamprophyric dykes and end with acidic magmatism including trachytic, microsyenitic, syenitic and phonolitic domes. The original magma of the Eslamy peninsula rocks has a potassic alkaline nature (Roman type) rich in LREE and LILE and depleted of HREE. These characteristics suggest that the origin of magma can be from deep mantle with a garnet lherzolite composition, a low partial melting rate which has been contaminated by crustal materials in its way up. Fractional crystallization of olivine, diopsidic clinopyroxene and leucite played an important role in the evolution of magmas. Scrutinizing the geodynamic environment of Eslamy peninsula rocks in discrimination diagrams indicates that these rocks must have been formed in a post-collision magmatic arc setting.</p>

				<title>Hydrothermal alteration studies of gabbros from Northern Central Indian Ridge and their geodynamic implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0659-0676</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mylonitic gabbro and altered gabbro were recovered from off-axis high and corner high locations at ridge-transform intersection, adjacent to Vityaz transform fault of the slow spreading (32–35mm/yr, full spreading) Northern Central Indian Ridge. Both the varieties show signatures of extensive alteration caused due to interaction with sea water. Mylonitic gabbro represents high temperature metamorphism (∼700–800&#176; C) and comprised of hornblende mineral which exhibits well defined foliation/gneissic appearance along with dynamically recrystallised plagioclase grains frequently intercalated with magnetite-ilmenite. Altered gabbro from corner high generally includes low temperature greenschist grade (∼300&#176; C) mineralogical assemblages: chlorite, albite, quartz and locally magnesio hornblende. Crystal plastic deformation resulted in mylonite formation and often porphyroclasts of plagioclase and clinopyroxene grains, while altered gabbro locally exhibits cataclastic texture. Presence of Vityaz transform fault and adjacent megamullion at the weakly magmatic ridge-transform intersection and off-axis high locations prompted the present scenario very much conducive for hydrothermal circulation and further facilitate the exhumation of present suite of gabbro.</p>

				<title>Existence of longitudinal waves in pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0677-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium, three types of quasi-waves propagate along an arbitrary direction. In general, none of the waves is truly longitudinal. The present study finds the specific directions in a pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium along which longitudinal waves may propagate. This paper demonstrates how the propagation of longitudinal waves is affected by various pre-stresses present in the medium. The study establishes the explicit expressions defining the existence and propagation of longitudinal waves in pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium. These expressions involve not only the direction and elastic stiffness of the medium, but also the prestresses present in the medium. Changes in conditions for the existence of longitudinal waves in orthotropic, monoclinic and triclinic anisotropies are discussed in detail. The most important part of the paper is a practical aspect suggested to calculate the specific directions for the existence of longitudinal waves in pre-stressed anisotropic elastic medium. In this approach, only those parameters are used that can be observed by the receiver in a geophysical experiment of wave propagation. The existence of longitudinal waves has been shown graphically using a numerical example for three types of anisotropic symmetries in elastic medium.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The deep sea is well known for its high faunal diversity. But the current interest in its abundant polymetallic nodules, poses a threat to the little known benthic organisms surviving in this unique environment. The present study is the first attempt to document the Indian Ocean abyssal benthic diversity of macroinvertebrates and to investigate its relation to the surface primary production (chl-𝑎), sediment labile organic matter, organic carbon and texture. The present study is based on 87 individuals. Altogether 39 macroinvertebrate genera were obtained from water depths of 4500–5500m from 23 box cores. Reduction in macrobenthic density was seen towards the southern latitudes. The area was dominated by deposit feeding macrobenthos. Vertically, the fauna was distributed down to 30 cm depth, with the highest faunal density in the top 2–5 cm sediment section. The values for population density were strongly correlated with surface water chl-𝑎 and sediment protein, indicating supply of fresh organic matter as a critical factor for maintaining the deep sea benthic diversity and abundance.</p>

				<title>Mineral composite assessment of Kelkit River Basin in Turkey by means of remote sensing</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0701-0710</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Utilizing remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) tools, mineral composite characteristics (ferrous minerals (FM), iron oxide (IO), and clay minerals (CM)) of the Kelkit River Basin (15913.07 km<sup>2</sup>) in Turkey were investigated and mapped. Mineral composite (MC) index maps were produced from three LANDSAT-ETM+ satellite images taken in 2000. Resulting MC index maps were summarized in nine classes by using ‘natural breaks’ classification method in GIS. Employing bi-variety correlation analysis, relationships among index maps were investigated. According to the results, FM and IO index maps showed positive correlation, while CM index map is negatively correlated with FM and IO index maps. Negative correlations between iron and clay variables suggested that the dominant clay minerals of the study area might be smectite, illite, kaolinite, and chlorite, which have little or no iron content. Using field data for which their geographic coordinates had been determined by global positioning system (GPS), developed MC maps were verified, and found dependable for environmental and ecological modeling studies.</p>

				<title>Monitoring and evaluation of seasonal snow cover in Kashmir valley using remote sensing, GIS and ancillary data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0711-0720</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seasonal snow cover is a vital natural resource in the Himalaya. Monitoring of the areal extent of seasonal snow cover is important for both climatological studies as well as hydrological applications. In the present paper, snow cover monitoring was carried out to evaluate the region-wise accumulation and ablation pattern of snow cover in Pir Panjal and Shamshawari ranges of Kashmir valley. The study was carried out for the winter period between November and April of 2004–05, 2005–06 and 2006–07, using multi-temporal WiFS sensor data of IRS-1C/1D satellites. The study shows reduction in the areal extent of seasonal snow cover and rising trend of maximum temperature in three winters for the entire Kashmir valley. This has been validated with 20 years (1988– 89 to 2007–08) climatic conditions prevailed in both ranges of Kashmir valley. Region-wise study shows the spatial and temporal variability in seasonal snow cover within Kashmir valley. Advance melting was observed in Banihal and Naugam/Tangdhar regions than Gurez and Machhal regions. Different geographical parameters of these regions were studied to evaluate the influence on snow cover and it was observed that altitude and position of region with respect to mountain range are the deciding factors for retaining the seasonal snow cover for longer duration. Such region-wise study of snow cover monitoring, can provide vital inputs for planning the hydropower projects, development in habitat areas, recreational and strategic planning in the region.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of low latitude ionospheric E-region irregularities linked with daytime VHF scintillations measured from Varanasi</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0721-0732</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>VHF amplitude scintillations recorded during the daytime period from January 1991 to December 1993, April 1998 to December 1999 and January 2008 to December 2008 at low latitude station Varanasi (geographic lat. = 25&#176; 15&#8242;N; long. = 82&#176; 59&#8242;E; geomagnetic lat. = 14&#176; 55&#8242;N, long. = 154&#176;E, dip angle = 37.3&#176;, sub-ionospheric dip = 34&#176;) have been analyzed to study the behaviour of ionospheric E-region irregularities during the active solar and magnetic periods. The autocorrelation functions, power spectral densities, signal de-correlation times are computed to study the temporal features of ionospheric E-region irregularities linked with daytime scintillations. Derived spectral index ranges between −2 and −9. Assuming velocity of irregularities, the characteristic lengths of the E-region irregularities are estimated. We have estimated the minimum and maximum range of scale length of sporadic-E ($E_s$) irregularities to be observed over Varanasi. These results are in close agreement with those reported from this latitude region.</p>

				<title><sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr anomalies in Late Cretaceous–Early Tertiary strata of the Cauvery basin, south India: Constraints on nature and rate of environmental changes across K–T boundary</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Ariyalur–Pondicherry sub-basin of the Cauvery basin comprises a near complete stratigraphic record of Upper Cretaceous–Lower Tertiary periods. Earlier studies have documented variations of clay mineral assemblages, change in microtexture of siliciclasts and many geochemical and stable isotopic anomalies far below the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (KTB) in these strata. This paper documents the occurrences of two positive <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr anomalies preceding K–T boundary in this basin and discusses plausible causes. Analysis of trace elemental and stable isotopic profiles, sedimentation history, petrography and mineralogy of the rocks reveal that while both the anomalies may be due to increased detrital influx caused by sea level and climatic changes, the second anomaly might have been influenced by Deccan volcanism which in turn predated KTB. Record of such anomalies preceding K–T boundary supports the view of multi-causal step-wise extinction of biota across KTB.</p>

				<title>Felsic tuff from Rutland Island – A pyroclastic flow deposit in Miocene-sediments of Andaman-Java subduction complex</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0019-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The bedded felsic tuff exposed in Rutland Island, Andaman, consists of two facies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>white massive tuff with ill-defined bedding contacts (facies-A) and</li>
						<li>dominantly green tuff exhibiting well-developed turbidite sequence with up-section change from a massive unit to plane laminated units to ripple drift lamination (facies-B).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The felsic tuff is vitric to crysto-vitric in nature and contains broken crystals of quartz, feldspar, biotite and glass shards of different shapes and sizes. The bulk chemistry indicates trachyte to dacite compositional range, and high values of Zr relative to Nb and Y suggest convergent margin tectonic setting of the tuff. Dominance of cuspate shards rather than blocky shards in both the facies indicates subaerial eruption of the pyroclasts. Recurrence of turbidites as well as good sorting of crystals and glass suggest that subaerially erupted ash was transported in subaqueous condition. The bed pattern supports rapid deposition of facies- A from high concentration turbidity flow whereas facies-B could be produced by decrease in grain size and suspended-load fallout rate of turbidity current. Regional correlation suggests that felsic volcanism in Sumatra was the source for such early Miocene to middle Miocene tuff.</p>

				<title>Inversion of quasi-3D DC resistivity imaging data using artificial neural networks</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0027-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of artificial neural networks in inverting quasi-3D DC resistivity imaging data. An electrical resistivity imaging survey was carried out along seven parallel lines using a dipole–dipole array to confirm the validation of the results of an inversion using an artificial neural network technique. The model used to produce synthetic data to train the artificial neural network was a homogeneous medium of 100𝛺 m resistivity with an embedded anomalous body of 1000𝛺 m resistivity. The network was trained using 21 datasets (comprising 12159 data points) and tested on another 11 synthetic datasets (comprising 6369 data points) and on real field data. Another 24 test datasets (comprising 13896 data points) consisting of different resistivities for the background and the anomalous bodies were used in order to test the interpolation and extrapolation of network properties. Different learning paradigms were tried in the training process of the neural network, with the resilient propagation paradigm being the most efficient. The number of nodes, hidden layers, and efficient values for learning rate and momentum coefficient have been studied. Although a significant correlation between results of the neural network and the conventional robust inversion technique was found, the ANN results show more details of the subsurface structure, and the RMS misfits for the results of the neural network are less than seen with conventional methods. The interpreted results show that the trained network was able to invert quasi-3D electrical resistivity imaging data obtained by dipole–dipole configuration both rapidly and accurately.</p>

				<title>Influence of climatic teleconnections on the temporal isotopic variability as recorded in a firn core from the coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0041-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ice and firn core studies provide one of the most valuable tools for understanding the past climate change. In order to evaluate the temporal isotopic variability recorded in ice and its relevance to environmental changes, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were studied in a firn core from coastal Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. The annual 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O profile of the core shows a close relation to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The ENSO indices show significant correlation with the surface air temperatures and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O values of this region during the austral summer season and support an additional influence related to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The correlation between the combined ENSO-SAM index and the summer 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O record seems to have been caused through an atmospheric mechanism. Snow accumulation in this region illustrates a decreasing trend with opposite relationships with 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O data and surface air temperature prior and subsequent to the year 1997. A reorganization of the local water cycle is further indicated by the deuterium excess data showing a shift around 1997, consistent with a change in evaporation conditions. The present study thus illustrates the utility of ice-core studies in the reconstruction of past climate change and suggests possible influence of climatic teleconnections on the snow accumulation rates and isotopic profiles of snow in the coastal regions of east Antarctica.</p>

				<title>Recent trends in pre-monsoon daily temperature extremes over India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0051-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extreme climate and weather events are increasingly being recognized as key aspects of climate change. Pre-monsoon season (March–May) is the hottest part of the year over almost the entire South Asian region, in which hot weather extremes including heat waves are recurring natural hazards having serious societal impacts, particularly on human health. In the present paper, recent trends in extreme temperature events for the pre-monsoon season have been studied using daily data on maximum and minimum temperatures over a well-distributed network of 121 stations for the period 1970–2005. For this purpose, time series of extreme temperature events have been constructed for India as a whole and seven homogeneous regions, viz., Western Himalaya (WH),  Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), North Central (NC), East coast (EC), West coast (WC) and  Interior Peninsula (IP).</p>
					<p>In general, the frequency of occurrence of hot days and hot nights showed widespread increasing trend, while that of cold days and cold nights has shown widespread decreasing trend. The frequency of the occurrence of hot days is found to have significantly increased over EC, WC and IP, while that of cold days showed significant decreasing trend over WH and WC. The three regions EC, WC and NW showed significant increasing trend in the frequency of hot nights. For India as whole, the frequency of hot days and nights showed increasing trend while cold days and nights showed decreasing trends. Day-to-day fluctuations of pre-monsoon daily maximum and minimum temperatures have also been studied for the above regions. The results show that there is no significant change in day-to-day magnitude of fluctuations of pre-monsoon maximum and minimum temperatures. However, the results generally indicate that the daily maximum and minimum temperatures are becoming less variable within the season.</p>

				<title>Study of land surface temperature and spectral emissivity using multi-sensor satellite data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0067-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, an attempt has been made to estimate land surface temperatures (LST) and spectral emissivities over a hard rock terrain using multi-sensor satellite data. The study area, of about 6000 km<sup>2</sup>, is a part of Singhbhum–Orissa craton situated in the eastern part of India. TIR data from ASTER, MODIS and Landsat ETM+ have been used in the present study. Telatemp Model AG-42D Portable Infrared Thermometer was used for ground measurements to validate the results derived from satellite (MODIS/ASTER) data. LSTs derived using Landsat ETM+ data of two different dates have been compared with the satellite data (ASTER and MODIS) of those two dates. Various techniques, viz., temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, gray body adjustment approach in TES algorithm, Split-Window algorithms and Single Channel algorithm along with NDVI based emissivity approach have been used. LSTs derived from bands 31 and 32 of MODIS data using Split-Window algorithms with higher viewing angle (50&#176;) (LST1 and LST2) are found to have closer agreement with ground temperature measurements (ground LST) over waterbody, Dalma forest and Simlipal forest, than that derived from ASTER data (TES with AST 13). However, over agriculture land, there is some uncertainty and difference between the measured and the estimated LSTs for both validation dates for all the derived LSTs. LST obtained using Single Channel algorithm with NDVI based emissivity method in channel 13 of ASTER data has yielded closer agreement with ground measurements recorded over vegetation and mixed lands of low spectral contrast. LST results obtained with TIR band 6 of Landsat ETM+ using Single Channel algorithm show close agreement over Dalma forest, Simlipal forest and waterbody with LSTs obtained using MODIS and ASTER data for a different date. Comparison of LSTs shows good agreement with ground measurements in thermally homogeneous area. However, results in agriculture area with less homogeneity show difference of LST up to 2&#176;C. The results of the present study indicate that continuous monitoring of LST and emissivity can be undertaken with the aid of multi-sensor satellite data over a thermally homogeneous region.</p>

				<title>On the modeling of electrical boundary layer (electrode layer) and derivation of atmospheric electrical profiles, eddy diffusion coeffcient and scales of electrode layer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0075-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrode layer or electrical boundary layer is one of the charge generators in the global atmospheric electric circuit. In spite of this we find very few model studies and few measurements of it in the literature. Using a new technique it is shown that in this layer, the space charge density varies exponentially in vertical. A new experimental method based on the surface measurements is discussed to determine all the characteristic scales and an average electrical and meteorological state of an electrode layer. The results obtained are in good agreement with the previous studies. So, it is suggested that an exponential space charge density profile will no longer be an assumption in the case of electrode layer studies. The profiles of atmospheric electric field and electrical conductivity are also derived and a new term named as electrode layer constant is introduced.</p>

					<p>The ion–aerosol balance equations are solved to get the profiles of atmospheric electric parameters over the ground surface in an aerosol-rich environment under the conditions of surface radioactivity. Combining the earlier results for low aerosol concentrations and the present results for high aerosol concentrations, a relation is obtained between the average value of atmospheric electric space charge in the lowest ∼2m, the surface electric field and eddy diffusivity/aerosol concentration. The values of eddy diffusivity estimated from this method using some earlier measurements of space charge and surface electric field are in reasonably good agreement with those calculated from other standard methods using meteorological or electrical variables.</p>

				<title>Retrieval of hydrometeors from microwave radiances with a polarized radiative transfer model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0097-0115</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the results of a Bayesian-based algorithm for the retrieval of hydrometeors from microwave satellite radiances. The retrieval technique proposed makes use of an indigenously developed polarized radiative transfer (RT) model that drives a data driven optimization engine (Bayesian) to perform retrievals of rain and other hydrometeors in a multi-layer, plane parallel raining atmosphere. For the sake of completeness and for the purposes of comparison, retrievals with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have also been done. Retrievals have been done first with a simplified two-layer atmosphere, where assumed values of hydrometeors are given to the forward model and these are taken as ‘measured radiances’. The efficacy of the two retrieval strategies is then tested for this case in order to establish accuracy and speed. The highlight of the work is however, the case study wherein a tropical storm in the Bay of Bengal is taken up, to critically examine the performance of the retrieval algorithm for an extreme event wherein a 14-layer realistic, raining atmosphere has been considered and retrievals are done against Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) measured radiances. The key novelties of the work are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>inclusion of polarization from both hydrometeors and oceans in the RT model, and</li>
						<li>populating the database involving atmospheric profiles <i>vs</i>. simulated radiances by profiles of similar rain events in the past.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In this work, the database was populated with TRMM retrieved profiles for tropical cyclones that occurred earlier in the area of interest (Indian Ocean), rather than with the Goddard Cloud Ensemble profiles. The use of (i) polarization in the forward model and (ii) creation of an a <i>priori</i> database for the retrieval denote the significant departure from the current state-of-the-art in the area.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Chhoti Gandak is a meandering river which originates in the terai area of the Ganga Plain and serves as a lifeline for the people of Deoria district, Uttar Pradesh. It travels a distance of about 250 km and drains into Ghaghara near Gothani, Siwan district of Bihar. It has been observed that people of this region suffer from water-borne health problems; therefore water samples were collected to analyse its quality along the entire length of Chhoti Gandak River.</p>
					<p>The principal components of water quality are controlled by lithology, gentle slope gradient, poor drainage, long residence of water, ion exchange, weathering of minerals, heavy use of fertilizers, and domestic wastes. At some stations water is hard with an excess alkalinity and is not suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes. The variation in the local and regional hydrogeochemical processes distinguished the geogenic sources from the anthropogenic one.</p>

				<title>Distribution of arsenic and mercury in subtropical coastal beachrock, Gulf of Mannar, India</title>

				<page>0129-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An assessment of coastal pollution was made on the basis of trace element concentrations (arsenic –As, mercury – Hg) in the Gulf of Mannar. The beachrock samples were collected along the coastal tracts between Rameswaram and Kanyakumari. The samples were dried and digested to determine the As and Hg using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS-air-acetylene and nitrous oxide method). The As and Hg accumulation status of the beachrock was assessed using geo-accumulation index values ($I_{geo}$). The accumulation of As and Hg in the beachrock ranges from 2.75 to 20.72 𝜇 g g<sup>−1</sup> and from 0.06 to 0.31 𝜇 g g<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The As and Hg concentrations in the beachrocks are compared with crustal average values and average of other region sediments. The possible source of the contamination is from atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic activities.</p>

					<p>We determine the degree of variation of model ﬁtness,to a true model based on amplitude variation with angle (AVA)methodology for a synthetic gas hydrate model,using co-operative fuzzy c-means clustering,constrained to a rock physics model.When a homogeneous starting model is used,with only traditional least squares optimization scheme for inversion,the variance of the parameters is found to be comparatively high.In this co-operative methodology,the output from the least squares inversion is fed as an input to the fuzzy scheme.Tests with co-operative inversion using fuzzy c-means with damped least squares technique and constraints derived from empirical relationship based on rock properties model show improved stability,model ﬁtness and variance for all the three parameters in comparison with the standard inversion alone.</p>

				<title>The Suruli shear zone and regional scale folding pattern in Madurai block of Southern Granulite Terrain, south India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0147-0160</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Through the application of remote sensing techniques followed by field checks, the exact extension  and nature of Suruli shear zone in Madurai block of southern granulite terrain (SGT) in south India is brought out for the first time in this work. The dominant rock type exposed in this area is charnockite intruded by granites. The Suruli ductile shear zone extends from just west of Kadaiyanallur in the south to Ganguvarpatti in the north over a length of 150 km. Between Kadaiyanallur and Kambam, the shear zone extends roughly in N–S direction. From Kambam, it swerves towards NE and then towards ENE near Ganguvarpatti. The strongly developed transposed foliation and mylonite foliation within the shear zone dip towards east only and so the eastern block (Varushanad hills) is the hanging wall and the western block (Cardamom hills) is the footwall of the shear zone. In the eastern block, three distinct phases of regional scale folding (F1, F2 and F3) are recognized. In complete contrast, the western block recorded only the last phase (F3) regional scale folding. As the more deformed eastern block (older terrain) moved over the relatively less deformed western block (younger terrain) along the Suruli shear zone, it is proposed that this shear zone is a thrust or reverse fault, probably of Proterozoic age. As there are evidences for decreasing displacement from north to south (i.e., from Ganguvarpatti to Kadaiyanallur), the Suruli shear zone could be a rotational thrust or reverse fault with the pivot located close to Kadaiyanallur. As the pivot is located near Achankovil shear zone which trends WNW-ESE (dip towards SSW), the Suruli shear zone could be splaying (branching) out from Achankovil shear zone. In a nutshell, the Suruli shear zone could be a splay, rotational thrust or reverse fault.</p>

				<title>Strain analysis and stratigraphic status of Nongkhya, Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates of Shillong basin, Meghalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0161-0174</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Shillong basin, one of the Purana basins of the Indian peninsula is situated in the central and eastern parts of the Shillong plateau of NE India. Metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the basin are of Mesoproterozoic age and lithostratigraphically belong to Shillong Group (erstwhile Shillong series) comprising Lower Metapelitic Formation (LMF) and Upper Quartzitic Formation (UQF). A long, persistent, faulted and tectonically attenuated conglomerate known as Nongkhya–Sumer– Mawmaram-conglomerate separates these two formations. In the present work, quantitative strain analyses of the pebbles of Sumer, Nongkhya and Mawmaram conglomerates of Ri-Bhoi and West Khasi Hills districts of Meghalaya are carried out using manual and computerized programmes. Eight different techniques for intrapebble, interpebble and bulk rock strain estimation are applied and results are compared systematically. Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates bear the testimony of broadly flattening type of deformation (0 &gt; 𝑘 &gt; 1) while Nongkhya conglomerate shows constriction type (1 &gt; 𝑘 &gt; 𝛼). The change in strain ellipsoid shape from Nongkhya to Mawmaram area is accompanied by a change of fabric from 𝑆 &gt; 𝐿 to 𝐿 &gt; 𝑆 tectonites. Affinity of rotational strain is more in Nongkhya conglomerate as compared to Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates. The compactness of pebbles is high in case of Nongkhya conglomerate and low to moderate in Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates indicating high strain in Nongkhya conglomerate (northeastern part of Shillong basin) relative to Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates (southwestern part of Shillong basin). Thus strain magnitude increases from SW to NE direction of the Shillong basin.</p>
					<p>The tectonostratigraphic status of these conglomerates suggest that the Sumer and Mawmaram conglomerates were initially a part of one conglomerate horizon of interformation type between LMF and UQF of the Shillong Group. With progressive deformation, the northeastern part of the Sumer conglomerate suffered tectonic attenuation and separation and eventually thrusted over the Basement Gneissic Group (BGG) as a tectonic mélange. This sector of the conglomerate is known as Nongkhya conglomerate. The tectonic configuration of the Nongkhya conglomerate is the  effect of right and left lateral strike slip movement of Sumer conglomerate at Sumer and Adabasti points, respectively. This is a positive signature of post 𝐷_{3} deformation on the Sumer conglomerate. The regional sigmoidal pattern of the interformational conglomerate broadly correlate with the Tyrsad-Barapani Shear Zone (TBSZ) of sinistral nature.</p>

				<title>Contrasting magmatic signatures in the Rairakhol and Koraput alkaline complexes, Eastern Ghats belt, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0175-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relation between alkaline magmatism and tectonism has been a contentious issue, particularly for the Precambrian continental regions. Alkaline complexes at the southwestern margin of Eastern Ghats belt, India, have been interpreted as rift-valley magmatism. However, those complexes occurring in granulite ensemble in the interior segments of the Eastern Ghats belt could not possibly be related to the rift-system, assumed for the western margin of the Eastern Ghats belt. Koraput complex was emplaced in a pull-apart structure, dominated by magmatic fabrics and geochemically similar to a fractionated alkaline complex, compatible with an alkalibasalt series. Rairakhol complex, on the other hand, shows dominantly solid-state deformation fabrics and geochemically similar to a fractionated calc-alkaline suite. Isotopic data for the Koraput complex indicate ca. 917 Ma alkaline magmatism from a depleted mantle source and postcrystalline thermal overprint at ca. 745 Ma, also recorded from sheared metapelitic country rocks. The calc-alkaline magmatism of the Rairakhol complex occurred around 938 Ma, from an enriched mantle source, closely following Grenvillian granulite facies imprint in the charnockitic country rocks.</p>

				<title>Doppler weather Radar based Nowcasting of cyclone Ogni</title>

				<page>0183-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we describe offline analysis of Indian Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) data from cyclone Ogni using a suite of radar algorithms as implemented on NEXRAD and the advanced algorithms developed jointly by the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) and the University of Oklahoma. We demonstrate the applicability of the various algorithms to Indian radar data, the improvement in the quality control and evaluate the benefit of nowcasting capabilities in Indian conditions. New information about the tropical cyclone structure, as derived from application of the algorithms is also discussed in this study.</p>
					<p>Finally, we suggest improvements that could be made to the Indian data collection strategies, networking and real-time analysis. Since this is the first study of its kind to process and utilize DWR data in a tropical climate, the suggestions on real-time analysis and data collection strategies made in this paper, would in many cases, be beneficial to other countries embarking on DWR network modernization programs.</p>

					<p>We apply Fourier and wavelet analyses to the precipitation and sunspot numbers in the time series (1901–2000) over Australia (27&#176;S, 133&#176;E), Canada (60&#176;N, 95&#176;W), Ethiopia (8&#176;N, 38&#176;E), Greenland (72&#176;N, 40&#176;W), United Kingdom (54&#176;N, 2&#176;W), India (20&#176;N, 77&#176;E), Iceland (65&#176;N, 18&#176;W), Japan (36&#176;N, 138&#176;E), United States (38&#176;N, 97&#176;W), South Africa (29&#176;S, 24&#176;E) and Russia (60&#176;N, 100&#176;E). Correlation analyses were also performed to find any relation among precipitation, sunspot numbers, temperature, and cloud-cover at the same spatial and temporal scale. Further correlations were also performed between precipitation with electron and proton fluence at the time interval, 1987–2006. All these parameters were considered in annual and seasonal scales. Though correlation study between precipitation and other parameters do not hint any linear relation, still the Fourier and wavelet analyses give an idea of common periodicities. The 9–11 year periodicity of sunspot numbers calculated by Fourier transform is also confirmed by wavelet transform in annual scale. Similarly, wavelet analysis for precipitation also supports the short periods at 2–5 years which is verified by Fourier transform in discontinuous time over different geographic regions.</p>

				<title>Characteristic of plasma bubbles observed by DMSP in the topside ionosphere during the year 2005</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0211-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To study the characteristic of plasma bubbles in the topside ionosphere during the solar minima, we have analyzed a large database of post-sunset plasma density measurement acquired during ∼5104 equatorial crossings made by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F14 in 2005. On 675 of these crossings, equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) events were observed as intervals of depleted and irregular plasma densities that degrade communication and navigation signals. We have analyzed these EPB events to study their distributions with month, season and longitude. To test for possible dependence of EPB occurrence at topside altitudes on the level of magnetic activity, we compared the distributions of one year database with those of Kp index at the time of equatorial crossings by the DMSP satellites. We also examined the response of the evening sector, low-latitude ionosphere during eight magnetic storms with minimum Dst &#8804; −100nT. We observed that EPBs occurred regularly during geomagnetic storms, especially in the initial and main phases but can be suppressed sometimes for days, after prolonged activity during  recovery phases. These results are discussed according to the other reported results.</p>

				<title>First results of fair-weather atmospheric electricity measurements in Northeast India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0221-0228</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the month of March 2006, a short campaign was conducted to measure fair-weather atmospheric electricity parameters in Tripura, Northeast India (23.50&#176;N, 91.25&#176;E). The campaign was the first of its kind in this region of the globe. The main objective of the campaign was to characterize the diurnal variation of three parameters namely vertical potential gradient (𝐸), vertical air–earth current density (<i>Jz</i>) and atmospheric electrical conductivity (𝜎) in fair-weather conditions. The diurnal variation of 𝐸 and <i>Jz</i> over sixteen fair-weather days shows two distinct maxima around 14UT and 20UT and a minimum around 03UT. The average vertical potential gradient is found to be 108V·m<sup>−1</sup> and air–earth current density 1.85 pA·m<sup>−2</sup>. The average bipolar atmospheric electrical conductivity at the ground level is found to be 19.6 fS·m<sup>−1</sup>. An excellent positive correlation between 𝐸 and <i>Jz</i> is found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96. A comparative study with Carnegie universal variation shows 70% correlation with observed variation of vertical potential gradient during the period of the campaign. The results are discussed in view of difficulty as well as possibility of getting global signatures in atmospheric electricity measurements made from tropical land stations.</p>

				<title>Active and break spells of the Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0229-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we suggest criteria for the identification of active and break events of the Indian summer monsoon on the basis of recently derived high resolution daily gridded rainfall dataset  over India (1951–2007). Active and break events are defined as periods during the peak monsoon months of July and August, in which the normalized anomaly of the rainfall over a critical area, called the monsoon core zone exceeds 1 or is less than −1.0 respectively, provided the criterion is satisfied for at least three consecutive days. We elucidate the major features of these events. We consider very briefly the relationship of the intraseasonal fluctuations between these events and the interannual variation of the summer monsoon rainfall.</p>
					<p>We find that breaks tend to have a longer life-span than active spells. While, almost 80% of the active spells lasted 3–4 days, only 40% of the break spells were of such short duration. A small fraction (9%) of active spells and 32% of break spells lasted for a week or longer. While active events occurred almost every year, not a single break occurred in 26% of the years considered. On an average, there are 7 days of active and break events from July through August. There are no significant trends in either the days of active or break events. We have shown that there is a major difference between weak spells and long intense breaks. While weak spells are characterized by weak moist convective regimes, long intense break events have a heat trough type circulation which is similar to the circulation over the Indian subcontinent before the onset of the monsoon.</p>
					<p>The space-time evolution of the rainfall composite patterns suggests that the revival from breaks occurs primarily from northward propagations of the convective cloud zone. There are important differences between the spatial patterns of the active/break spells and those characteristic of interannual variation, particularly those associated with the link to ENSO. Hence, the interannual variation of the Indian monsoon cannot be considered as primarily arising from the interannual variation of intraseasonal variation. However, the signature over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean on intraseasonal time scales is similar to that on the interannual time scales.</p>

				<title>Total column density variations of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in presence of different types of clouds</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0249-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The zenith sky scattered light spectra were carried out using zenith sky UV-visible spectrometer in clear and cloudy sky conditions during May–November 2000 over the tropical station Pune (18&#176;32&#8242;N, 73&#176;51&#8242;E). These scattered spectra are obtained in the spectral range 462–498 nm between 75&#176; and 92&#176; solar zenith angles (SZAs). The slant column densities (SCDs) as well as total column densities (TCDs) of NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>4</sub> are derived with different SZAs in clear and cloudy sky conditions. The large enhancements and reductions in TCDs of the above gases are observed in thick cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds and thin high cirrus (Ci) clouds, respectively, compared to clear sky conditions. The enhancements in TCDs of O<sub>3</sub> appear to be due to photon diffusion, multiple Mie-scattering and multiple reflections between layered clouds or isolated patches of optically thick clouds. The reductions in TCDs due to optically thin clouds are noticed during the above period. The variations in TCDs of O<sub>3</sub> measured under cloudy sky are discussed with total cloud cover (octas) of different types of clouds such as low clouds (C<sub>L</sub>), medium clouds (C<sub>M</sub>) and high clouds (C<sub>H</sub>) during May–November 2000. The variations in TCDs of O<sub>3</sub> measured in cloudy sky conditions are found to be well matched with cloud sensitive parameter colour index (CI) and found to be in good correlation. The TCD<sub>cloudy</sub> are derived using airmass factors (AMFs) computed without considering cloud cover and CI in radiative transfer (RT) model, whereas TCD<sub>model</sub> are derived using AMFs computed with considering cloud cover, cloud height and CI in RT model. The TCD<sub>model</sub> is the column density of illuminated cloudy effect. A good agreement is observed between TCD<sub>model</sub>, TCD<sub>Dob</sub> and TCD<sub>GOME</sub>.</p>

				<title>Assessing climate change impacts on water balance in the Mount Makiling forest, Philippines</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0265-0283</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A statistical downscaling known for producing station-scale climate information from GCM output was preferred to evaluate the impacts of climate change within the <i>Mount Makiling</i> forest watershed, Philippines. The lumped hydrologic BROOK90 model was utilized for the water balance assessment of climate change impacts based on two scenarios (A1B and A2) from CGCM3 experiment. The annual precipitation change was estimated to be 0.1–9.3% increase for A1B scenario, and −3.3 to 3.3% decrease/increase for the A2 scenario. Difference in the mean temperature between the present and the 2080s were predicted to be 0.6$–$2.2&#176;C and 0.6$–$3.0&#176;C under A1B and A2 scenarios, respectively. The water balance showed that 42% of precipitation is converted into evaporation, 48% into streamflow, and 10% into deep seepage loss. The impacts of climate change on water balance reflected dramatic fluctuations in hydrologic events leading to high evaporation losses, and decrease in streamflow, while groundwater flow appeared unaffected. A study on the changes in monthly water balance provided insights into the hydrologic changes within the forest watershed system which can be used in mitigating the effects of climate change.</p>

				<title>Shift in detrital sedimentation in the eastern Bay of Bengal during the late Quaternary</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0285-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Down-core variations of granulometric, geochemical and mineral magnetism of a 70-cm long sediment core retrieved from the eastern Bay of Bengal abyssal region were studied to understand sedimentation pattern and sediment provenance during the last ∼12 kyr BP. Based on down-core physical and elemental variations, three units were identified: unit 3 (70–43 cm) is a ∼30 cm thick clayey silt organic carbon-rich (0.5–0.92%) turbidite probably delivered by the Brahmaputra River during the late Quaternary period. Units 2 (43–24 cm) and 1 (24–0 cm) represent enhanced and  reduced supply of coarse-grained detrital sediments from the Ganges River during early and late Holocene period, respectively. Increased terrigenous supply dilutes calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and biogenic elements (P, Ba and Cu) in units 3 and 2. On the contrary, a reduction in detrital input enhances CaCO<sub>3</sub> and biogenic elements in unit 1. Lithogenic elements (Ti, Al, K and Rb) and shale-normalized REE patterns in all three units suggest terrigenous source. The shift in provenance from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges derived sediments is evident by a sharp increase in sediment grain size, increased concentration and grain size assemblages of magnetic minerals, lithogenic elements concentration and $La_{n}/Yb_{n}$ ratio. This study highlights terrigenous dilution on biogenic sedimentation in the eastern Bay of Bengal sediments.</p>

				<title>Granularity and textural analysis as a proxy for extreme wave events in southeast coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0297-0305</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extreme wave events of 1000 and 1500 years (radiocarbon ages) have been recently reported in Mahabalipuram region, southeast coast of India. Subsequently, we carried out extensive sedimentological analysis in regions covering a total lateral coverage of 12 km with a new archeological site as the central portion of the study area. Twelve trenches in shore normal profiles exhibit landward thinning sequences as well as upward fining sequences confirming with the global signatures of extreme wave events. The sediment size ranges from fine-to-medium and moderately well sorted-to-well sorted, and exhibit positive skewness with platykurtic-to-leptokurtic nature. We now propose the abrupt winnowing or back and forth motion including unidirectional transport of these deposited sediments, which results in positive skewness. Textural analyses derived from scanning electron microscope studies (SEM) demonstrate the alteration produced, in the ilmenite mineral with vivid presence of pits and crescents with deformation observed on the surface due to extreme wave activities. This is further confirmed with the predominance of high-density mineral such as magnetite (5.2) and other heavy minerals in these deposits inferred the high-intensity of the reworking process of the beach shelf sediments.</p>

				<page>0307-0341</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Systematic description of 25 gastropod species from the Khari Nadi Formation (Aquitanian) and Chhasra Formation (Burdigalian) from the Kachchh District, Gujarat, India is given. A checklist of 116 forms including those reported by earlier researchers, emending taxonomic identifications wherever necessary, is also provided. Vredenburg had referred these two formations together as ‘the Gaj Beds of Kachchh’. He noticed the affinity of molluscs among the Miocene deposits of Kachchh and Kathiawar regions of Gujarat, and Sind province of Pakistan. He also observed that molluscs from his ‘Lower Gaj’ and ‘Upper Gaj’ Formations showed relationship respectively with the Rembang (Aquitanian) and Njalindung (Burdigalian) series of the East Indies. Aquitanian and Burdigalian ages assigned by him were later substantiated by Raju on the basis of foraminifera. Present studies corroborated that the molluscan assemblage from the Miocene rocks of Kachchh is closely related to that from the Gaj Beds of Sind and the Ashapura Clay Member of Kathiawar; besides revealing that the fauna from these three formations taken together is essentially endemic. Discovery of certain species from the Quilon Beds in the Miocene of Kachchh evinces a close affinity between these two formations. The present fauna includes five extant forms, while 29 forms have related species in the Recent fauna.</p>

They vary from Al-rich compositions [Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 53wt.%; Cr#, 100Cr/(Cr + Al) = 12] to Cr-rich compositions [Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 51wt.%; Cr&#35;= 84], and from Cr-Al rich compositions towards Cr-rich Ti-magnetite (TiO<sub>2</sub> up to 23 wt.%, ulvöspinel up to 67mol.%). The Mg&#35;[100Mg/(Mg + Fe<sup>2+</sup>)] of spinel decreases from 81 to nearly zero. The highest Cr&#35;has been found in the Bushe Fm., Thakurvadi Fm., and some high-Ti basalts of the Pavagadh section, whereas some of the low-Ti basalts of Saurashtra have Al-rich compositions typical of spinels found in mid-ocean ridge basalts. The chemical composition of the Deccan Trap spinels is completely different compared to that observed in mantle spinel suites, with very few exceptions. The decreasing Al and increasing Fe and Ti of spinel seems to be mainly the result of decrease of Mg in the locally coexisting melts and favourable cationic substitutions in the lattice. There is barely any evidence of general relationships between the composition of the Deccan spinels and inferred mantle sources of the host magmas. Pyroxene inclusions in spinels may witness a high-pressure stage of crystallization, but the possibility of non-equilibrium crystallization, or even  magma mixing, cannot be ruled out. Overall, the compositional ranges of chromiferous spinel in the Deccan Traps closely match those observed in the other Large Igneous Provinces having mafic/ultramafic intrusions and mafic magma compositions (e.g., Siberian Traps,  Karoo, Emeishan).</p>

				<title>Complete preservation of ophiolite suite from south Andaman, India: A mineralchemical perspective</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0365-0381</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Field studies supplemented by petrographic analyses clearly reveal complete preservation of ophiolite suite from Port Blair (11&#176; 39&#8242; N: 92&#176; 45&#8242;E) to Chiriyatapu (11&#176; 30&#8242; 24&#8242;&#8242;N: 92&#176; 42&#8242; 30&#8242;&#8242;E) stretch of South Andaman. The ophiolite suite reveals serpentinite at the base which is overlain unconformably by cumulate ultramafic–mafic members with discernible cumulus texture and igneous layering. Basaltic dykes are found to cut across the cumulate ultramafic–mafic members. The succession is capped by well exposed pillow basalts interlayered with arkosic sediments. Olivine from the basal serpentinite unit are highly magnesian (Fo<sub>80.1–86.2</sub>). All clinopyroxene analyses from cumulate pyroxenite, cumulate gabbro and basaltic dyke are discriminated to be ‘Quad’ and are uniformly restricted to the diopside field. Composition of plagioclase in different lithomembers is systematically varying from calcic to sodic endmembers progressively from cumulate pyroxenite to pillow basalt through cumulate gabbro and basaltic dyke. Plagioclase phenocrysts from basaltic dyke are found to be distinctly zoned (An<sub>60.7</sub>$–$An<sub>35.5</sub>) whereas groundmass plagioclase are relatively sodic (An<sub>33</sub>$–$An<sub>23.5</sub>). Deduced thermobarometric data from different lithomembers clearly correspond to the observed preservation of complete ophiolite suite.</p>

				<title>Source parameters estimation of 2003 Bam earthquake Mw 6.5 using empirical Green’s function method, based on an evolutionary approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0383-0396</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We determine the source parameters for 2003 (Mw 6.5) Bam, Iran, earthquake using an empirical Green’s function summation approach to model ground motions recorded by two strong motion stations at approximately 45 km epicentral distance. We introduce a genetic algorithm technique to optimize the fit to observed elastic response spectra. The proposed genetic algorithm technique allows us to explore the sensitivity of the results to multiple source parameters, including hypocenter location, focal mechanism (Strike and Dip), P-wave velocity in depth, fault dimension and rupture and healing velocities.</p>
					<p>We simulated the three components of seismogram at a far station, Mohammad-Abad station, by means of an inversion solution technique and predicted seismograms at another far station, Abaragh, incorporating the estimated model parameters. More agreement of our synthesized seismograms with those of the observed data in comparison with the results of other investigators confirms the reliability of estimated seismological parameters and the applicability of our technique.</p>
					<p>A series of sensitivity analysis are performed for demonstrating the influence of individual model parameter variation on defined error value. Using the empirical Green’s function summation method, our inferred source parameters provide the basis for predicting main shock shaking and guiding retrofitting efforts at sites, for example, the historical buildings in Arge- Bam site which were damaged during the 2003 Bam earthquake and strong motion data is unavailable.</p>

				<title>Towards understanding the unusual Indian monsoon in 2009</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0397-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian summer monsoon season of 2009 commenced with a massive deficit in all-India rainfallof 48% of the average rainfall in June. The all-India rainfall in July was close to the normal but that in August was deficit by 27%. In this paper, we first focus on June 2009, elucidating the special features and attempting to identify the factors that could have led to the large deficit in rainfall. In June 2009, the phase of the two important modes, viz., El Ni˜no and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO) was unfavourable. Also, the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (EEIO) was warmer than in other years and much warmer than the Bay. In almost all the years, the opposite is true, i.e., the Bay is warmer than EEIO in June. It appears that this SST gradient gave an edge to the tropical convergence zone over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean, in competition with the organized convection over the Bay. Thus, convection was not sustained for more than three or four days over the Bay and no northward propagations occurred. We suggest that the reversal of the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient between the Bay of Bengal and EEIO, played a critical role in the rainfall deficit over the Bay and hence the Indian region. We also suggest that suppression of convection over EEIO in association with the El Ni˜no led to a positive phase of EQUINOO in July and hence revival of the monsoon despite the El Ni˜no. It appears that the transition to a negative phase of EQUINOO in August and the associated large deficit in monsoon rainfall can also be attributed to the El Ni˜no.</p>

				<title>Mesoscale model forecast verification during monsoon 2008</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0417-0446</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There have been very few mesoscale modelling studies of the Indian monsoon, with focus on the verification and intercomparison of the operational real time forecasts. With the exception of Das <i>et al</i> (2008), most of the studies in the literature are either the case studies of tropical cyclones and thunderstorms or the sensitivity studies involving physical parameterization or climate simulation studies. Almost all the studies are based on either National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), USA, final analysis fields (NCEP FNL) or the reanalysis data used as initial and lateral boundary conditions for driving the mesoscale model.</p>
					<p>Here we present a mesoscale model forecast verification and intercomparison study over India involving three mesoscale models: (i) the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA, (ii) the MM5 model developed by NCAR, and (iii) the Eta model of the NCEP, USA. The analysis is carried out for the monsoon season, June to September 2008. This study is unique since it is based entirely on the real time global model forecasts of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) T254 global analysis and forecast system. Based on the evaluation and intercomparison of the mesoscale model forecasts, we recommend the best model for operational real-time forecasts over the Indian region.</p>
					<p>Although the forecast mean 850 hPa circulation shows realistic monsoon flow and the monsoon trough, the systematic errors over the Arabian Sea indicate an easterly bias to the north (of mean flow) and westerly bias to the south (of mean flow). This suggests that the forecasts feature a southward shift in the monsoon current. The systematic error in the 850 hPa temperature indicates that largely the WRF model forecasts feature warm bias and the MM5 model forecasts feature cold bias. Features common to all the three models include warm bias over northwest India and cold bias over southeast peninsula. The 850 hPa specific humidity forecast errors clearly show that the Eta model features dry bias mostly over the sea, while MM5 features moist bias over large part of domain. The RMSE computed at different levels clearly establish that WRF model forecasts feature least errors in the predicted free atmospheric fields. Detailed rainfall forecast verification further establishes that the WRF model forecast rainfall skill remains more or less same in day-2 and day-3 as in day-1, while the forecast skill in the MM5 and Eta models, deteriorates in day-2 and day-3 forecasts.</p>

				<title>Assessing impact of climate change on season length in Karnataka for IPCC SRES scenarios</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0447-0460</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Changes in seasons and season length are an indicator, as well as an effect, of climate change. Seasonal change profoundly affects the balance of life in ecosystems and impacts essential human activities such as agriculture and irrigation. This study investigates the uncertainty of season length in Karnataka state, India, due to the choice of scenarios, season type and number of seasons. Based on the type of season, the monthly sequences of variables (predictors) were selected from datasets of NCEP and Canadian General Circulation Model (CGCM3). Seasonal stratifications were carried out on the selected predictors using K-means clustering technique. The results of cluster analysis revealed increase in average, wet season length in A2, A1B and B1 scenarios towards the end of 21st century. The increase in season length was higher for A2 scenario whereas it was the least for B1 scenario. COMMIT scenario did not show any change in season length. However, no change in average warm and cold season length was observed across the four scenarios considered. The number of seasons was increased from 2 to 5. The results of the analysis revealed that no distinct cluster could be obtained when the number of seasons was increased beyond three.</p>

				<title>Comparative study of MLT mean winds using MF radars located at 16.8&#176; N and 8.7&#176;N</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0461-0470</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main aim of the paper is to describe mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) wind field observed between June 2000 and May 2002 by medium frequency (MF) radars at two locations near the equatorial region and at tropical latitude. We have presented and compared observations of mean horizontal winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region over Kolhapur (16.8&#176;N, 74.2&#176;E) and Tirunelveli (8.7&#176;N, 77.8&#176;E). Our analysis reveals annual oscillation in the zonal wind and semi-annual oscillation in the meridional wind over Kolhapur. On the other hand, results over Tirunelveli reveal semi-annual oscillation (SAO) in the zonal wind and annual oscillation in the meridional wind. Also we have observed enhanced magnitude of wind speed in spring equinox period of 2002 exhibiting the signatures of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) over Tirunelveli.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric aerosol formation and its growth during the cold season in India</title>

				<page>0471-0477</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effects of molecular diffusivity of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> vapours on nucleated particles of SO$^{2−}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ species are reported. Condensation sink and source rate of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> vapours, growth rates and ratios of real to apparent nucleation rates are calculated for SO$^{2−}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ aerosols using fractional contributions of them in total aerosol size-distribution during the measurement period at Pune, reported in Chate and Pranesha (2004). The percentage of nucleated SO$^{2−}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ aerosols of mid-point diameter 13 nm are 2% and 3% respectively of the total particles (13 nm &#8804; $D_{p}$ &#8804;750nm) for both H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> diffusion. In the diameter range $75 nm \leq D_{p} \leq 133 nm$, it is 48% and 45% of SO$^{2−}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ aerosols, respectively for NH<sub>3</sub> diffusion and 43% and 36% of SO$^{2−}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> diffusion. Increase in percentage of nucleated particles of these species corresponding to mid-point diameter 133 nm around 0900 h IST is significantly higher than that of mid-point diameter 13 nm and it is due to photo-chemical nucleation, coagulation and coalescence among nucleated clusters. The ratios of real to apparent formation rates for SO$^{2−}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ aerosols are 12% and 11% respectively, corresponding to mid-point diameter 13 nm, 17% and 13%, for midpoint diameter 133 nm and 12% and 9.5%, for mid-point diameter 750 nm. The results indicate that nucleation involving H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and acidic NH<sub>3</sub> diffusion on SO$^{2−}_{4}$ and NO$^{−}_{3}$ particles is the most relevant mechanism in this region.</p>

				<title>Changes in concentration and size distribution of aerosols during fog over the south Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0479-0487</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of the concentration and size distribution of aerosol particles in the size-ranges of 0.5–20 𝜇 m and 16–700 nm diameters were made during six fog episodes over the south Indian Ocean. Observations show that concentrations of particles of all sizes start decreasing 1–2 hours before the occurrence of fog. This decrease is more prominent for coarse particles of &lt; 1 𝜇 m diameter and continues until 10–20 minutes before the onset of fog when  particle concentrations in all size ranges rapidly increase by one/two orders of magnitude in ∼20 minutes. Thereafter, concentrations of particles of all sizes gradually decrease until the dissipation of fog. After the fog dissipation, concentrations of coarse mode particles rapidly increase and restore to their pre-fog levels but concentrations of the Aitken mode particles decrease slowly and reach their pre-fog levels only after 1–2 hours. The net effect of fog is to change the bimodal size distributions of aerosols with a coarse mode at 1.0 𝜇 m and an accumulation mode at 40–60 nm to a power law size distribution. It is proposed that the preferential growth and sedimentation of the coarse mode hygroscopic particles in the initial phase cause a large decrease in the aerosol surface area. As a result, the low vapour pressure gases which were initially being used for the growth of coarse mode particles, now accelerate the growth  rates of the accumulation and Aitken mode particles.</p>

				<title>A new ionospheric tomographic algorithm – constrained multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (CMART)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0489-0496</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For the limitation of the conventional multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART), a constrained MART (CMART) is proposed in this paper. In the new tomographic algorithm, a popular two-dimensional multi-point finite difference approximation of the second order Laplacian operator is used to smooth the electron density field. The feasibility and superiority of the new method are demonstrated by using the numerical simulation experiment. Finally, the CMART is used to reconstruct the regional electron density field by using the actual GNSS data under geomagnetic quiet and disturbed days. The available ionosonde data from Beijing station further validates the superiority of the new method.</p>

				<title>Equatorial electrojet in east Brazil longitudes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0497-0505</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the morphology of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) along 45&#176;W longitude in east Brazil, where the ground magnetic (dip) equator is associated with the largest declination in the world. Daily range of the horizontal field (𝛿 𝐻), as expected, was largest at the station in the chain closest to the dip equator, Sao Luiz (inclination $−$0.25&#176;S). 𝛿 𝑍 was largest positive at Eusebio (inclination 9.34&#176;S) and largest negative at Belem (inclination 7.06&#176;N); both near the fringe of EEJ belt. 𝛿 𝑍 at Sao Luiz during the daytime was unexpectedly large negative in-spite of a small dip and also located south of the dip equator where 𝛿 𝑍 should be positive. Center of EEJ was found to be shifted southward of the dip equator by about 1&#176; in latitude. During southern summer, 𝛥 𝑌 started decreasing from 00 h and reached a minimum value in the afternoon, an abnormal feature not discussed for any station so far. The mid-day value of the direction of 𝛥 𝐻 vector was 22&#176;-24&#176;W compared to the declination of 19&#176;$–$21&#176;W in the region.</p>

				<title>Variability of soil moisture and its relationship with surface albedo and soil thermal diffusivity at Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram, south Kerala</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0507-0517</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous observation data collected over the year 2008 at Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram in south Kerala (76&#176; 59&#8242;E longitude and 8&#176; 30&#8242;N latitude) are used to study the diurnal, monthly and seasonal soil moisture variations. The effect of rainfall on diurnal and seasonal soil moisture is discussed. We have investigated relationships of soil moisture with surface albedo and soil thermal diffusivity. The diurnal variation of surface albedo appears as a U-shaped curve on sunny days. Surface albedo decreases with the increase of solar elevation angle, and it tends to be a constant when solar elevation angle is greater than 40&#176;. So the daily average surface albedo was calculated using the data when solar elevation angle is greater than 40&#176;. The results indicate that the mean daily surface albedo decreases with increases in soil moisture content, showing a typical exponential relation between the surface albedo and the soil moisture. Soil thermal diffusivity increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of soil moisture.</p>

				<title>Distribution of dissolved carbohydrates and uronic acids in a tropical estuary, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0519-0530</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbohydrates including uronic acids are among the active components of dissolved organic carbon, and play an important role in biogeochemical cycling of organic carbon in marine environments. In order to understand their distribution, concentrations of total dissolved carbohydrate (TCHO), dissolved polysaccharide (PCHO), dissolved monosaccharide (MCHO), and dissolved uronic acid (URA) were measured in the Mandovi estuary, west coast of India during the monsoon and premonsoon seasons. The estuary experienced nearly fresh water condition during the monsoon season and marine condition during the pre-monsoon season. Concentrations of TCHO, MCHO and URA ranged from 17.7 to 67.3 𝜇M C, 4.1 to 15.5 𝜇M C and 2.3 to 10.8 𝜇M C, and their contribution to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied from ∼11 to 60%, 2.5 to 9.7%, and 1.8 to 5.3%, respectively. PCHO accounted for ∼52 to 92% of the TCHO. Generally, concentrations and yields of TCHO species were greater during the monsoon season. Phytoplankton abundance and bacterial cell numbers influenced the distribution of TCHO in the pre-monsoon season but not during the monsoon season. Transport of TCHO rich (11 to 60%) dissolved organic matter from the Mandovi estuary to the coastal waters during the monsoon season may affect ecosystem function by fueling biological activity of heterotrophic micro-organisms.</p>

				<title>Correlation of the oldest Toba Tuff to sediments in the central Indian Ocean Basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0531-0539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have identified an ash layer in association with Australasian microtektites of ∼0.77Ma old in two sediment cores which are ∼450 km apart in the central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB). Morphology and chemical composition of glass shards and associated microtektites have been used to trace their provenance. In ODP site 758 from Ninetyeast Ridge, ash layer-D (13 cm thick, 0.73–0.75 Ma) and layer-E (5 cm thick, 0.77–0.78 Ma) were previously correlated to the oldest Toba Tuff (OTT) eruptions of the Toba caldera, Sumatra. In this investigation, we found tephra ∼3100 km to the southwest of Toba caldera that is chemically identical to layer D of ODP site 758 and  ash in the South China Sea correlated to the OTT. Layer E is not present in the CIOB or other ocean basins. The occurrence of tephra correlating to layer D suggests a widespread distribution of OTT tephra (∼3.6 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>2</sup>), an ash volume of at least ∼1800 km<sup>3</sup>, a total OTT volume of 2300 km<sup>3</sup>, and classification of the OTT eruption as a super-eruption.</p>

				<title>Detrital zircon and apatite fission track data in the Liaoxi basins: Implication to Meso-Cenozoic thermo-tectonic evolution of the northern margin of the North China Craton</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0541-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Detrital zircon and apatite fission track (ZFT and AFT) data of the sandstones collected from the Liaoxi basins served as a significant probe to study the Meso-Cenozoic thermo-tectonic reactivation events in the northern margin of the North China Craton. All sandstones show wide ZFT and AFT age spectrum and most of ZFT and AFT ages are younger than depositional age of respective host rocks, which suggest widespread track resetting of the host rocks in the Liaoxi basins after deposition. This hot geothermal status in the Liaoxi basins deduced from ZFT and AFT data is temporal consistent with the lithospheric evolution of the North China Craton, which implies that the lithosphere under the northern margin of the North China Craton underwent similar thermo-tectonic destruction process as the intracratonic Bohai Sea. The young ZFT peak age, which ranges from ∼50Ma to 20 Ma, to some extend, provides a temporal constraint on the time that lithosphere significantly thinned and following reverse of the Liaoxi basins and uplift of the eastern part of the Yan-Liao Orogenic Belt. Exhumation of 1.5–2 km can be estimated in the eastern part of the Yan-Liao Orogenic Belt since ∼30Ma to 10 Ma.</p>

				<title>The 2007 Bengkulu earthquake, its rupture model and implications for seismic hazard</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0553-0560</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 12 September 2007 great Bengkulu earthquake ($M_w$ 8.4) occurred on the west coast of Sumatra about 130 km SW of Bengkulu. The earthquake was followed by two strong aftershocks of $M_w$ 7.9 and 7.0. We estimate coseismic offsets due to the mainshock, derived from near-field Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements from nine continuous SuGAr sites operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) group. Using a forward modelling approach, we estimated slip distribution on the causative rupture of the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake and found two patches of large slip, one located north of the mainshock epicenter and the other, under the Pagai Islands. Both patches of large slip on the rupture occurred under the island belt and shallow water. Thus, despite its great magnitude, this earthquake did not generate a major tsunami. Further, we suggest that the occurrence of great earthquakes in the subduction zone on either side of the Siberut Island region, might have led to the increase in static stress in the region, where the last great earthquake occurred in 1797 and where there is evidence of strain accumulation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This study highlights the hydro-climatic features of the ﬁve wet periods contributing in different percentages to the annual rainfall total over major river basins in India.Spatial and temporal variations in the parameters such as starting date,duration and rainfall intensity of these wet periods throughout India have been discussed using daily gridded rainfall data for the period 1951 –2007.An attempt is also made here,to assess the impact of global SSTs on the start and duration of the wet periods in Indian river basins.</p>
					<p>It is observed that,for almost all river basins in India,the 10%wet period occurs in the months of July/August with an average duration of 1 –3 days and rainfall intensity varying from 44 to 89 mm/day.The duration of the wet period contributing 90%to the annual rainfall varies from 112 days in the central parts of India to 186 days in the northern parts of the country.Signi ﬁcant increase in the rainfall intensity has been observed in the case of some river basins of central India. The late start of 75%wet period along the West Coast and in peninsular river basins has been observed with increase in Nino 3.4 SSTs (MAM),while increase in the duration of the 75%wet period over the Krishna basin is associated with increase in Nino 3.4 SSTs (concurrent JJAS).</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Carolina Sandhills are known to have an area of maximum precipitation on its western boundary during the summer mainly due to differences in soil types.Statistical analysis was performed on summer precipitation data from automated weather stations in the Carolinas,along the Sandhills for the years 2001 to 2006.Statistically signiﬁcant difference was observed between the day and night precipitation amounts.A case study also revealed the diurnal pattern of convective precipitation.</p>
					<p>North American Mesoscale (NAM)model forecasts for the summers of 2004 to 2006 were evaluated using observations.The model underpredicted precipitation signiﬁcantly during nights. A numerical simulation using Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)model was performed for August 9 –11,2001 and the forecasts were compared with observed precipitation data.The model precipitation forecasts were better for daytime as compared to the night.This feature is attributed to model physics not capturing cloud –radiation interaction processes dominant during nights. Although this study is for a speciﬁc region in the US,results are applicable for other regions for similar conditions.</p>

				<title>Use of objective analysis to estimate winter temperature and precipitation at different stations over western Himalaya</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Temperature and fresh snow are essential inputs in an avalanche forecasting model.Without these  parameters,prediction of avalanche occurrence for a region would be very difficult.In the complex terrain of Himalaya,nonavailability of snow and meteorological data of the remote locations during snow storms in the winter is a common occurrence.In view of this persistent problem present study estimates maximum temperature,minimum temperature,ambient temperature and precipitation intensity on different regions of Indian western Himalaya by using similar parameters of the neighbouring regions.The location at which parameters are required and its neighbouring locations should all fall in the same snow climatic zone.Initial step to estimate the parameters at a location,is to shift the parameters of neighbouring regions at a reference height corresponding to the altitude of the location at which parameters are to be estimated.The parameters at this reference height are then spatially interpolated by using Barnes objective analysis.The parameters estimated on different locations are compared with the observed one and the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE)of the observed and estimated values of the parameters are discussed for the winters of 2007 –2008.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In this study,an attempt has been made to bring out the observational aspects of vertical wind shear in thunderstorms over Minicoy.Case studies of thunderstorm events have been examined to ﬁnd out the effect of vertical wind shear and instability on strength and longevity of thunderstorms.Role of vertical wind shear in thunderstorms and its mechanism has been explored in this study.Results reveal that for prolonged thunderstorms high and low instability along with moderate to high vertical wind shear (moderate:0.003S<sup>−1</sup> &#8804; vertical wind shear &#8804; 0.005S<sup>−1</sup> and high: &lt; 0.005S<sup>−1</sup>)  play a signiﬁcant role in longevity and strength of thunderstorms.The mechanism of vertical wind shear in thunderstorms was investigated in a few cases of thunderstorm events where the duration of thunderstorm was covered by the radiosonde/rawin ascent observation taken at Minicoy. Empirical model has been developed to classify thunderstorm type and to determine the strength and longevity of thunderstorms.Model validation has been carried out for selected cases.Model could classify thunderstorm type for most of the cases of thunderstorm events over island and coastal stations.</p>

				<title>Anomalous electric field changes and high flash rate beneath a thunderstorm in northeast India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0617-0625</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In spite of many experimental and theoretical studies the relationships between storm dynamics, severe weather,and lightning activity have been least understood.Measurements of electric ﬁeld made under a severe thunderstorm at a northeastern Indian station,Guwahati,India are reported. Lightning ﬂash rate increases drastically to about 84 ﬂashes per minute (fpm)during the active stage which lasted for about 7 minutes,from about 15 ﬂashes per minute during the initial phase of thunderstorm.Sudden increase in lightning ﬂash rate (‘lightning jump ’)of about 65 fpm/min is also observed in the beginning of the active stage.The dissipating stage is marked by slow and steady decrease in lightning frequency.Despite very high ﬂash rate during the active stage, no severe weather conditions are observed at the ground.It is proposed that the short duration of the active stage might be the reason for the non-observance of severe weather conditions at the ground.Analysis of Skew-t graph at Guwahati suggests that vertical distribution of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)also may play some role in non-occurrence  of  severe weather at ground in spite of large lightning ﬂash rate and lightning jump observed in this thunderstorm.Further,all electric ﬁeld changes after a lightning discharge indicates the presence of strong Lower Positive Charge Centers (LPCC)in the active and dissipation stages. This suggests that LPCC plays an important role in initiation of lightning discharges in these stages.</p>

				<title>Numerical study for production of space charge within the stratiform cloud</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0627-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One dimensional numerical model has been developed to predict the production of space charge and variations in other electrical parameters within the low level stratiform type of cloud having very weak vertical motion.Non-linear coupled differential equations which govern ion concentrations,charged and neutral droplet concentrations and electric ﬁeld were used.Symmetry has been  observed in all the electrical parameters within the cloud.The magnitude of average positive ion concentrations was observed to be high as compared to the negative ion concentrations,which is due to low scavenging rate of positive ions than the negative ions,highly attributed to their mobilities.The rate of scavenging of ions affects the concentration of charged droplets,which eventually inﬂuence the electric ﬁeld and thus the space charge density within the cloud.Maximum electric ﬁeld (𝐸_max) was observed at middle of the cloud whereas minimum was observed at both the edges of the cloud.Minimum electric ﬁeld (𝐸_min) was found to be equal and constant (∼27Vm<sup>−1</sup>)for any drop concentration.Net positive and negative space charges were observed at the top and bottom of the cloud,respectively.The simulated results show some discrepancies to the natural condition, which are due to simulations made under some basic assumptions and limitations and that will be incorporated in the future studies for natural cloud condition.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A study has been carried out by comparing the extreme wind speeds estimated based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for 100 years return period using Fischer Tippet-1 (commonly known as Gumbel)and Weibull distributions for three locations (off Goa,Visakhapatnam and Machilipatnam)in the north Indian Ocean.The wind dataset for Goa is compared with that from ERA-40 data.For higher wind speeds ($12-20 m s^{−1}$ ),NCEP wind speed has higher percentage of occurrence than that of ERA-40.Analysis has shown slight upward trend in the annual maximum wind for location off Machilipatnam with an increase of $1.2cms^{−1}$ per year and a decreasing trend of $−1.3cms^{−1}$ per year in the case of Goa.The Weibull distribution with shape parameter 2 ﬁts the annual maximum wind data better than FT-1 distribution.</p>

				<title>An experimental investigation to characterise soil macroporosity under different land use and land covers of northeast India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0655-0674</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Saturated macropore ﬂow is the dominant hydrological process in tropical and subtropical hilly watersheds of northeast India.The process of inﬁltration into saturated macroporous soils is primarily controlled by size,network,density,connectivity,saturation of surrounding soil matrix, and depthwise distribution of macropores.To understand the effects of local land use,land cover and management practices on soil macroporosity,colour dye inﬁltration experiments were conducted with ten soil columns (25 &#215; 25 &#215; 50 cm)collected from different watersheds of the region under similar soil and agro-climatic zones.The sampling sites included two undisturbed forested hillslopes,two conventionally cultivated paddy ﬁelds,two forest lands abandoned after Jhum cultivation,and two paddy ﬁelds,one pineapple plot and one banana plot presently under active cultivation stage of the Jhum cycle.Digital image analyses of the obtained dye patterns showed that the inﬁltration patterns differed signiﬁcantly for different sites with varying land use,land cover,and cultivation practices.Undisturbed forest soils showed high degree of soil macroporosity throughout the soil proﬁle,paddy ﬁelds revealed sealing of macropores at the topsoil due to hard pan formation,and Jhum cultivated plots showed disconnected subsoil macropores.The important parameters related to  soil macropores such as maximum and average size of macropores,number of active macropores,and depthwise distribution of macropores were estimated to characterise the soil macroporosity for the sites.These experimentally derived quantitative data of soil macro- porosity can have wide range of applications in the region such as water quality monitoring and groundwater pollution assessment due to preferential leaching of solutes and pesticides,study of soil structural properties and inﬁltration behaviour of soils,investigation of ﬂash ﬂoods in rivers, and hydrological modelling of the watersheds.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of phase chemistry and petrochemical aspects of Samchampi–Samteran differentiated alkaline complex of Mikir Hills, northeastern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0675-0699</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Samchampi –Samteran alkaline complex occurs as a plug-like pluton within the Precambrian granite gneisses of Mikir Hills,Assam,northeastern India and it is genetically related to Sylhet Traps.The intrusive complex is marked by dominant development of syenite within which ijolite – melteigite suite of rocks is emplaced with an arcuate outcrop pattern.Inliers of alkali pyroxenite and alkali gabbro occur within this ijolite –melteigite suite of rocks.The pluton is also traversed by younger intrusives of nepheline syenite and carbonatite.Development of sporadic,lumpy magnetite ore bodies is also recorded within the pluton.Petrographic details of the constituent lithomembers of the pluton have been presented following standard nomenclatorial rules.Overall pyroxene compositions range from diopside to aegirine augite while alkali feldspars are typically orthoclase and plagioclase in syenite corresponds to oligoclase species.Phase chemistry of nepheline is suggestive of Na-rich alkaline character of the complex.Biotite compositions are typically restricted to a uniform compositional range and they belong to ‘biotite ’ﬁeld in the relevant classiﬁcation scheme.Garnets (developed in syenite and melteigite)typically tend to be Ti-rich andradite,which on a closer scan can be further designated as melanites.Opaque minerals mostly correspond to magnetite.Use of Lindsley ’s pyroxene thermometric method suggests an equilibration temperature from ∼450&#176;$–$600&#176;C  for melteigite/alkali gabbro and ∼400&#176; C for syenite.Critical assessment of other thermometric methods reveals a temperature of equilibration of ∼700&#176;$–$1350&#176;C for ijolite –melteigite suite of rocks in contrast to a relatively lower equilibration temperature of ∼600&#176; C for syenite. Geobarometric data based on pyroxene chemistry yield an equilibration pressure of 5.32 –7.72 kb for ijolite,melteigite,alkali pyroxenite,alkali gabbro and nepheline syenite.The dominant syenite member of the intrusive plug records a much higher (∼11 kb)equilibration pressure indicating a deeper level of intrusion.Major oxide variations of constituent lithomembers with respect to differentiation index (D.I.)corroborate a normal magmatic differentiation.A prominent role of liquid immiscibility is envisaged from ﬁeld geological,petrographic and petrochemical evidences. Tectonic discrimination diagrams involving clinopyroxene chemistry strongly suggest within plate alkaline affinity for the parental magma which is in conformity with the regional plume tectonics.</p>

					<p>The Gondwana sediments comprising ﬁne-grained shales,carbonaceous shales,sandstones and the coal horizon in borecore RT-4 (approximately 547.00 m thick)from Tamra block,Raniganj Coal ﬁeld,Damodar Basin,are analyzed palynologically.Based on the distribution pattern of marker palynotaxa,two assemblage zones are identi ﬁed.In the Barren Measures Formation,dominance of enveloping monosaccate (<i>Densipollenites</i>) along with striate bisaccate (<i>Striatopodocarpites,Fauni- pollenites</i>) pollen taxa,and the FAD ’s of <i>Kamthisaccites</i> and <i>Arcuatipollenites</i> observed at 30.75, have equated this strata (30.75 –227.80 m thick)with the Raniganj Formation of Late Permian in  age.Downwards in the Barakar Formation,between 423.80 –577.70 m depths,an abundance of non-striate (<i>Scheuringipollenites</i> )and striate(<i>Faunipollenites</i> and <i>Striatopodocarpites</i> )bisaccate pollen taxa is observed,that dates late Early Permian in age.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The terpenoid composition of resins from the Miocene lignite horizons from the Kerala –Konkan Coast,western India was analyzed by Curie-point pyrolysis –gas chromatography –mass spectrometry (Cupy –GC –MS).The major pyrolysates were cadalene-based bicyclic sesquiterpenoids including some C<sub>30</sub>-C<sub>31</sub> bicadinenes and bicadinanes typical of dammar resin from angiosperm plants of Dipterocarpaceae family.These plants are typically supported by tropical climates which the western Indian region was known to have experienced during early Tertiary period.The present study suggests that these palaeoclimatic conditions persisted until at least the Miocene epoch.These sesquiterpenoids which are commonly detected in many SE Asian crude oils may be utilised as useful biomarkers for petroleum exploration in the western Indian region.</p>

				<title>Assessment of flexural analysis applied to the Sumatra–Java subduction zone</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0717-0730</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indian Ocean subduction zone is one of the most active plate margins of the globe as evident from its vast record of great magnitude earthquake and tsunami events.We use Bouguer admittance (Morlet isostatic response function)in Sumatra –Java subduction zones comprising both the subduction and over-riding plates to determine the lithospheric mechanical strength variations. We determine effective elastic thickness $(T_e)$ for ﬁve oceanic windows (size 990 &#215; 990 km<sup>2</sup>) by analyzing the admittance using Bouguer gravity and bathymetry data. The results show bimodal $T_e$ values &gt; 20 km for Sumatra and 20 –40 km for Java.The lower bimodal values obtained for Sumatra appears to correlate well with the zones of historical seismicity.This is in sharp contrast with Java subduction zone,which shows higher $T_e$ values (20 –40 km)and apparently associated with low magnitude earthquakes.We suggest a strong and wide interseismic coupling for Sumatra between the subducting and over-riding plates,and deeper mantle contributing to low strength,shallow focus –high magnitude seismicity and <i>vice versa</i> for Java,leading to their seismogenic zonation.</p>

				<title>Estimates of source parameters of 𝑀 4.9 Kharsali earthquake using waveform modelling</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0731-0743</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the computation of time series of the 22 July 2007 𝑀 4.9 Kharsali earthquake. It occurred close to the Main Central Thrust (MCT)where seismic gap exists.The main shock and 17 aftershocks were located by closely spaced eleven seismograph stations in a network that involved VSAT based real-time seismic monitoring.The largest aftershock of 𝑀 3.5 and other aftershocks occurred within a small volume of 4 &#215; 4 km horizontal extent and between depths of 10 and 14 km. The values of seismic moment $(M_o)$ determined using P-wave spectra and Brune’s model based on $f^2$ spectral shape ranges from $10^{18}$ to $10^{23}$ dyne-cm.The initial aftershocks occurred at greater depth compared to the later aftershocks.The time series of ground motion have been computed for recording sites using geometric ray theory and Green ’s function approach.The method for computing time series consists in integrating the far-ﬁeld contributions of Green ’s function for a number of distributed point source.The generated waveforms have been compared with the observed ones.It has been inferred that the Kharsali earthquake occurred due to a northerly dipping low angle thrust fault at a depth of 14 km taking strike N279&#176;E, dip 14&#176; and rake 117&#176;. There are two regions on the fault surface which have larger slip amplitudes (asperities)and the rupture which has been considered as circular in nature initiated from the asperity at a greater depth shifting gradually upwards.The two asperities cover only 10%of the total area of the causative fault plane.However,detailed seismic imaging of these two asperities can be corroborated with structural heterogeneities associated with causative fault to understand how seismogenesis is inﬂuenced by strong or weak structural barriers in the region.</p>

				<title>Soil-gas helium and surface-waves detection of fault zones in granitic bedrock</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0745-0751</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fracture and fault networks are conduits that facilitate groundwater movement in hard-rock terrains.Soil-gas helium emanometry has been utilized in Wailapally watershed,near Hyderabad in southern India,for the detection of fracture and fault zones in a granite basement terrain having a thin regolith.Based on satellite imagery and geologic mapping,three sites were selected for detailed investigation.High spatial resolution soil-gas samples were collected at every one meter at a depth of &lt;1.5m along 100 m long proﬁles (3 in number).In addition,deep shear-wave images were also obtained using the multichannel analysis of surface waves.The study clearly indicates several soil-gas helium anomalies (above 200 ppb)along the pro ﬁles,where the shear-wave velocity images also show many near-surface vertical low velocity zones.We thus interpret that the soil-gas helium anomalous zones and the vertical low-velocity zones are probable traces of fault/fracture zones that could be efficient natural recharge zones and potential groundwater conduits.The result obtained from this study demonstrates the efficacy of an integrated approach of soil-gas helium and the seismic methods for mapping groundwater resource zones in granite/gneiss provinces.</p>

				<title>Chemistry of snow and lake water in Antarctic region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0753-0762</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface snow and lake water samples were collected at different locations around Indian station at Antarctica, Maitri, during December 2004-March 2005 and December 2006-March 2007.Samples were analyzed for major chemical ions. It is found that average pH value of snow is 6.1. Average pH value of lake water with low chemical content is 6.2 and of lake water with high chemical content is 6.5.The Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> are the most abundantly occurring ions at Antarctica. Considerable amount of SO$^{2-}_{4}$ is also found in the surface snow and the lake water which is attributed to the oxidation of DMS produced by marine phytoplankton.Neutralization of acidic components of snow is mainly done by NH$^{+}_{4}$ and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> are nearly equally effective in neutralizing the acidic components in lake water.The NH$^{+}_{4}$ and SO$^{2-}_{4}$ occur over the Antarctica region mostly in the form of (NH<sub>4</sub>)2SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

				<title>Estimation of infiltration rate, run-off and sediment yield under simulated rainfall experiments in upper Pravara Basin, India: Effect of slope angle and grass-cover</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0763-0773</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main objective of this study is to measure the effect of slope and grass-cover on in ﬁltration rate, run-off and sediment yield under simulated rainfall conditions in a badland area located in the upper Pravara Basin in western India. An automatic rainfall simulator was designed following Dunne <i>et al</i> (1980) and considering the local conditions. Experiments were conducted on six selected experimental ﬁelds of 2 &#215; 2 m within the catchment with distinct variations in surface characteristics –grass-covered area with gentle slope, recently ploughed gently sloping area, area covered by crop residue (moderate slope), bare badland with steep slope, gravelly surface with near ﬂat slope and steep slope with grass-cover. The results indicate subtle to noteworthy variations amongst the plots depending on their slope angle and surface characteristics. An important ﬁnding that emerges from the study is that the grass-cover is the most effective measure in inducing inﬁltration and in turn minimizing run-off and sediment yield. Sediment yields are lowest in gently sloping grass-covered surfaces and highest in bare badland surfaces with steep slopes. These ﬁndings have enormous implication for this area, because over 2/3 area is characterized by bare and steep slopes.</p>

				<title>Verification of cloud cover forecast with INSAT observation over western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0775-0781</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Since the beginning of the summer monsoon 2009, experimental mesoscale weather forecasts in real time are being generated using WRF model by the Meteorology and Oceanography Group at the Space Applications Centre (ISRO)and are disseminated through MOSDAC (www.mosdac.gov.in) to various users. To begin with, the 12 h, 24 h and 48 h forecasts for the western India region are made available. A study is undertaken to comprehensively assess the cloudiness prediction performance of WRF model. The evaluations have been made over the three months period during monsoon 2009. INSAT cloud imagery data has been used as a reference for these evaluations. The veriﬁcation strategy includes computation of various skill scores. It is seen that probability of detection (POD)of cloud is 84% and the false alarm rate (FAR) is around 18%. It is hoped that this assessment will provide information on the use of these forecasts in various applications.</p>

				<title>Investigating origin of the inadequate medium range predictability of the lower tropospheric ultra-long waves in tropics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0783-0802</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The predictability of planetary or ultra-long scale waves is limited by the large growth of errors in these scales in almost all the medium range forecast models. Understanding the cause for the enormous build up of error is, therefore, a necessary task for improving the prediction of planetary waves. A diagnostic analysis of the systematic error energetics has been performed in the Global Forecast System model to investigate the reasons for poor predictability of the lower tropospheric ultra-long waves (wavenumber bands 1 –4)in tropics using the analysis –forecast system of horizon- tal wind ﬁeld at 850 hPa level during the boreal summer period. For this purpose, systematic error energy is computed in spatial as well as in wavenumber domain. Non-linear inter-scale transfer of error has been formulated and evaluated through energy exchanges among participating triads. The study reveals that the error is generated in the prognostic model initially with a small magnitude at the different locations around tropical convergence zone (TCZ) attributed to the inaccuracy in representing different physical processes like cumulus convection applied in the model. At subsequent evolution of forecasts, error increases and spreads along the TCZ due to its non-linear advection to the higher scales and eventually to the ultra-long scales attributed to the inherent dynamics of the model evaluated through the process of wave –wave exchange of error energy in terms of the triad interactions. The continuous generation and then, non-linear propagation of error up to the planetary scales in the course of prediction increase the uncertainty in ultra-long scales which actually inhibit to predict accurately the planetary scale waves in tropics during medium range forecasts. This work suggests caveats to the modeler’s community in the predictability study of tropical ultra-long waves.</p>

				<title>Seaward dipping reflectors along the SW continental margin of India: Evidence for volcanic passive margin</title>

				<page>0803-0813</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-channel seismic reﬂection proﬁles across the southwest continental margin of India (SWCMI) show presence of westerly dipping seismic reﬂectors beneath sedimentary strata along the western ﬂank of the Laccadive Ridge –northernmost part of the Chagos –Laccadive Ridge system. Velocity structure, seismic character, 2D gravity model and geographic locations of the dipping reﬂectors suggest that these reﬂectors are volcanic in origin, which are interpreted as Seaward Dipping Reﬂectors (SDRs).</p>
					<p>The SDRs; 15 to 27 km wide overlain by ∼1 km thick sediment; are observed at three locations and characterized by stack of laterally continuous, divergent and off-lapping reﬂectors. Occurrence of SDRs along western ﬂank of the Laccadive Ridge adjacent to oceanic crust of the Arabian Basin and 2D crustal model deduced from free-air gravity anomaly suggest that they are genetically related to incipient volcanism during separation of Madagascar from India.</p>
					<p>We suggest that (i)SWCMI is a volcanic passive margin developed during India –Madagascar breakup in the Late Cretaceous, and (ii)continent –ocean transition lies at western margin of the Laccadive Ridge, west of feather edge of the SDRs. Occurrence of SDRs on western ﬂank of the Laccadive Ridge and inferred zone of transition from continent to ocean further suggest continental nature of crust of the Laccadive Ridge.</p>

				<title>Mafic dykes at the southwestern margin of Eastern Ghats belt: Evidence of rifting and collision</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0815-0823</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The southwestern margin of the Eastern Ghats Belt characteristically exposes ma ﬁc dykes intruding massif-type charnockites. Dykes of olivine basalt of alkaline composition have characteristic trace element signatures comparable with Ocean Island Basalt (OIB). Most importantly strong positive Nb anomaly and low values of Zr/Nb ratio are consistent with OIB source of the maﬁc dykes. K –Ar isotopic data indicate two cooling ages at 740 and 530 Ma. The Pan-African thermal event could be related to reactivation of major shear zones and represented by leuco-granite vein along minor shear bands. And 740 Ma cooling age may indicate the low grade metamorphic imprints, noted in some of the dykes. Although no intrusion age could be determined from the present dataset, it could be constrained by some age data of the host charnockite gneiss and Alkaline rocks of the adjacent Prakasam Province. Assuming an intrusion age of ∼1 .3 Ga, Sr –Nd isotopic composition of the dykes indicate that they preserved time-integrated LREE enrichment. In view of the chemical signatures of OIB source, the ma ﬁc dykes could as well be related to continental rifting, around 1.3 Ga, which may have been initiated by intra-plate volcanism.</p>

				<page>0825-0839</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Neoproterozoic Bhander Group in the Son Valley, central India conformably overlying the Rewa Group, is the uppermost subdivision of the Vindhyan Supergroup dominantly composed of arenites, carbonates and shales. In Maihar –Nagod area, a thick pile of unmetamorphosed clastic sedimentary rocks of Bhander Group is exposed, which provides a unique opportunity to study Neoproterozoic basin development through provenance and tectonic interpretations. The provenance discrimination and tectonic setting interpretations are based on modal analysis and whole rock geochemistry. The average framework composition of the detrital sediments composed of quartz and sedimentary lithic fragments are classiﬁed as quartz arenite to sublitharenite. The sandstone geochemically re ﬂects high SiO<sub>2</sub> moderate Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and low CaO and Na<sub>2</sub>O type arenite. The high concentration of HFSE such as Zr, Hf , and Th/Sc, Th/U ratios in these sandstones indicate a mixed provenance. The chondrite normalized REE pattern shows moderate to strong negative Eu anomaly which suggests that major part of the sediments were derived from the granitic source area. The sandstone tectonic discrimination diagrams and various geochemical plots suggest that the provenance of the lower and upper Bhander sandstone formations was continental interior to recycled orogen.</p>

				<title>Field evidences of secondary surface ruptures occurred during the 20 February 1956 Eskişehir earthquake in the NW Anatolia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0841-0851</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surface rupture and source fault of the 20 February 1956 Eskişehir earthquake have been a matter of debate that potentially contributes towards the understanding of the active deformation and seismic risk in the highly populated NW Anatolia. Field observations on the two fault segments (namely Kavacık and Uludere faults) in the north of the Eskişehir graben revealed evidences of co-seismic surface rupture and mass movements during the Eskişehir earthquake. Surface rupture was observed as a 2.5 m wide, a 100 m long and ca.20 cm deep asymmetric depression in the Gümüşlü valley, 2 km east of the Uludere village. A trench dug on this depression con ﬁrms a prominent high-angle south dipping fault (dominantly left lateral strike slip) and two faint north-dipping antithetics as clear noticeable shear zones in organic-rich thick soil. Mass failures are particularly observed in spring depressions ﬁlled with loose torrent and carbonaceous material in front of the fault scarp. Some rock slides of several tens of meters in size that obviously require signiﬁcantly high ground shaking were also developed on steep fault scarps. The orientation of the principal stress tensor as deduced from the surface rupture of the Eskişehir earthquake displays clear inconsistency with the geometry of prominent faults in the area. We concluded that this disagreement may be explained by a curved surface rupture. The western and eastern tips of this rupture are EW trending and the probable NW-running part in the middle would correspond to the bounding zone between two right-stepping faults.</p>

				<title>Relationship between chemical composition and magnetic susceptibility in the alkaline volcanics from the Isparta area, SW Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0853-0860</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Potassium-rich volcanic rocks in the Isparta area (SW Turkey)consist mainly of older (Pliocene) volcanic rock suites (e.g., lamprophyre, basaltic trachyandesite, trachyandesite, trachyte) and younger (Quaternary) caldera forming lava dome/ﬂows (e.g., tephriphonolite, trachyte) and pyroclastics (ash/pumice fall deposits and ignimbritic ﬂows). The magnetic susceptibility (𝐾) was performed for both groups. The magnetic susceptibility value of the less evolved rocks characterized by SiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 57 wt%(e.g., basaltic trachyandesite, tephriphonolite, lamprophyric rocks) and having mostly maﬁc phenocrysts such as pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite-phlogopite is over 10 ($10^{−3}$ [SI]). Fine to medium-grained and subhedral to anhedral opaque minerals are scattered especially in the matrix phase of the less evolved volcanic rocks. However, the 𝐾 value of the more evolved rocks (e.g., trachyte and trachyandesites) with SiO<sub>2</sub> over 57 wt%vary between 0.1 and 28, but most of them below 10.SI values are negatively correlated with SiO<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>O, but positively correlated with Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CaO, MnO, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and MgO contents, suggesting inverse variation of SI with fractionation of potassic magma. That is to say that less evolved volcanic rocks have relatively higher magnetic susceptibility values in the volcanic suite.Fine to medium-grained and subhedral to anhedral Fe-Ti oxides are scattered mainly in the matrix phase of the less evolved volcanics, presumably cause the pronounced relatively higher magnetic susceptibility.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A critical study of 311 published WR chemical analyses,isotopic and mineral chemistry of anorthosites and associated rocks from eight Proterozoic massif anorthosite complexes of India, North America and Norway indicates marked similarities in mineralogy and chemistry among similar rock types.The anorthosite and maﬁc-leucomaﬁc rocks (e.g.,leuconorite,leucogabbro, leucotroctolite,anorthositic gabbro,gabbroic anorthosite,etc.)constituting the major part of the massifs are characterized by higher Na<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>O, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub> Mg&#35;and Sr contents,low in plagioclase incompatible elements and REE with positive Eu anomalies. Their 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O %0 (5.7 –7.5), initial <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr (0.7034–0.7066)and 𝜀<sub>Nd</sub> values (+1.14 to +5.5)suggest a depleted mantle origin. The Fe-rich dioritic rocks occurring at the margin of massifs have isotopic, chemical and mineral composition more close to anorthosite –maﬁc-leucomaﬁc rocks. However, there is a gradual decrease in plagioclase content, An content of plagioclase and X<sub>Mg</sub> of orthopyroxene, and an increase in maﬁc silicates, oxide minerals content, plagioclase incompatible elements and REE from anorthosite – maﬁc-leucomaﬁc rocks to Fe-rich dioritic rocks. The Fe-rich dioritic rocks are interpreted as residual melt from mantle derived high-Al gabbro melt, which produced the anorthosite and maﬁc-leucomaﬁc rocks. Mineralogically and chemically, the K-rich felsic rocks are distinct from anorthosite –maﬁc-leucomaﬁc-Fe-rich dioritic suite. They have higher 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O values (6.8 –10.8%) and initial <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr (0.7067-0.7104). By contrast, the  K-rich felsic suites are products of melting of crustal precursors.</p>

				<title>Radiative transfer simulations for the MADRAS imager of Megha-Tropiques</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the radiative transfer simulations for the passive microwave radiometer onboard the proposed Indian climate research satellite Megha-Tropiques due to be launched in 2011. These simulations have been performed by employing an in-house polarized radiative transfer code for raining systems ranging from depression and tropical cyclones to the Indian monsoon. For the sake of validation and completeness, simulations have also been done for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)’s Microwave Imager (TMI) of the highly successful TRMM mission of NASA and JAXA. The paper is essentially divided into two parts: (a) Radiometer response with specific focus on high frequency channels in both the radiometers is discussed in detail with a parametric study of the effect of four hydrometeors (cloud liquid water, cloud ice, precipitating water and precipitating ice) on the brightness temperatures. The results are compared with TMI measurements wherever possible. (b) Development of a neural network-based fast radiative transfer model is elucidated here. The goal is to speed up the computational time involved in the simulation of brightness temperatures, necessitated by the need for quick and online retrieval strategies. The neural network model uses hydrometeor profiles as inputs and simulates spectral microwave brightness temperature at multiple frequencies as output. A huge database is generated by executing the in-house radiative transfer code for seven different cyclones occurred in North Indian Ocean region during the period 2001–2006. A part of the dataset is used to train the network while the remainder is used for testing purposes. For the purpose of testing, a typical scene from the Southwest monsoon rain is also considered. The results obtained are very encouraging and show that the neural network is able to mimic the underlying physics of the radiative transfer simulations with a correlation coefficient of over 99%.</p>

					<p>INSAT-3D is the new generation Indian satellite designed for improved Earth observations through two payloads – <i>Imager</i> and <i>Sounder</i>. Study was conducted with an aim of simulating satellite level signal over land in the infrared channels of the Imager payload using a radiative transfer model MODTRAN. Satellite level at-sensor radiance corresponding to all four infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager payload is obtained using MODTRAN and sensitivity of at-sensor radiance was inferred as a function of input parameters namely, surface temperature, emissivity, view angle and atmospheric water vapour, which is helpful in understanding the signal simulation scheme needed for retrieving a very critical parameter namely, land surface temperature.</p>

				<title>Experimental real-time multi-model ensemble (MME) prediction of rainfall during Monsoon 2008: Large-scale medium-range aspects</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0027-0052</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Realistic simulation/prediction of the Asian summer monsoon rainfall on various space–time scales is a challenging scientific task. Compared to mid-latitudes, a proportional skill improvement in the prediction of monsoon rainfall in the medium range has not happened in recent years. Global models and data assimilation techniques are being improved for monsoon/tropics. However, multi-model ensemble (MME) forecasting is gaining popularity, as it has the potential to provide more information for practical forecasting in terms of making a consensus forecast and handling model uncertainties. As major centers are exchanging model output in near real-time, MME is a viable inexpensive way of enhancing the forecasting skill and information content. During monsoon 2008, on an experimental basis, an MME forecasting of large-scale monsoon precipitation in the medium range was carried out in real-time at National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), India. Simple ensemble mean (EMN) giving equal weight to member models, bias-corrected ensemble mean (BCEMn) and MME forecast, where different weights are given to member models, are the products of the algorithm tested here. In general, the aforementioned products from the multi-model ensemble forecast system have a higher skill than individual model forecasts. The skill score for the Indian domain and other sub-regions indicates that the BCEMn produces the best result, compared to EMN and MME. Giving weights to different models to obtain an MME product helps to improve individual member models only marginally. It is noted that for higher rainfall values, the skill of the global model rainfall forecast decreases rapidly beyond day-3, and hence for day-4 and day-5, the MME products could not bring much improvement over member models. However, up to day-3, the MME products were always better than individual member models.</p>

				<title>Impact of additional surface observation network on short range weather forecast during summer monsoon 2008 over Indian subcontinent</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0053-0064</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The three dimensional variational data assimilation scheme (3D-Var) is employed in the recently developed Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Assimilation experiments have been conducted to assess the impact of Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) surface observations (temperature and moisture) on the short range forecast over the Indian region. In this study, two experiments, CNT (without AWS observations) and EXP (with AWS observations) were made for 24-h forecast starting daily at 0000 UTC during July 2008. The impact of assimilation of AWS surface observations were assessed in comparison to the CNT experiment. The spatial distribution of the improvement parameter for temperature, relative humidity and wind speed from one month assimilation experiments demonstrated that for 24-h forecast, AWS observations provide valuable information. Assimilation of AWS observed temperature and relative humidity improved the analysis as well as 24-h forecast. The rainfall prediction has been improved due to the assimilation of AWS data, with the largest improvement seen over the Western Ghat and eastern India.</p>

				<title>Doppler SODAR observations of the temperature structure parameter during monsoon season over a tropical rural station, Gadanki</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0065-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Doppler SODAR (Sound Detection and Ranging) measurements over a tropical Indian station at National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL), Gadanki (13.5&#176;N, 79.2&#176;E) during two consecutive monsoon seasons, 2007 and 2008, are investigated to study the influence of mechanically generated turbulence on temperature structure parameter (C$^{2}_{T}$) in the convective boundary layer. Increase in the C$^{2}_{T}$ is observed after the arrival of monsoon for both seasons. Contribution of vertical wind shear in horizontal wind component to C$^{2}_{T}$ due to zonal winds is responsible for the increase observed in the temperature structure parameter which is inferred from the results obtained. C$^{2}_{T}$ is found to be increased by an order of 2 in both the lower and upper altitudes, respectively. Magnitude of wind speed is reported to be doubled with the arrival of monsoon. It is also observed that, southwest monsoon wind modulates the day-to-day variations of wind pattern over this station during the onset phase of monsoon season. The lower variability observed at lower height is attributed to the complex topography surrounding this region.</p>

				<title>Variability in surface inversion characteristics over India in winter during the recent decades</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0073-0084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variation in surface inversions during the recent decades over 20 stations in the Indian region is documented. Radiosonde data at 00UTC for the period 1971–2000 has been used to compute the inversion frequency. The depth and strength of the inversions as well as the wind speed through the inversion layer have also been computed. The frequency of inversions at stations north of 20&#176;N is ∼20$–$60% higher than stations located south of 20&#176;N. Moreover, all the stations show frequencies increasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade. Most of the stations show decreasing depth and increasing strength significant at 99% level. With the exception of Nagpur and Hyderabad which show high frequency of very deep inversions increasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade, the decadal variations of inversion depth at most of the other stations show that shallow and moderate inversions occur more frequently than deep or very deep inversions. Decadal variations in inversion strength show weak inversion frequencies decreasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade while moderate/strong inversions occur more frequently at most stations. Frequencies of very strong inversions are low or absent. Wind speeds are either weak or moderate with frequencies increasing from the 1st to the 3rd decade. Low frequency of strong winds and negligible frequency of very strong winds are observed.</p>

				<page>0085-0098</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Water samples were collected from different formations of Gadilam river basin and analyzed to assess the major ion chemistry and suitability of water for domestic and drinking purposes. Chemical parameters of groundwater such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), Calcium (Ca<sup>+</sup>), Magnesium (Mg<sup>+</sup>), Bicarbonate (HCO$_{3}^-$), Sulphate (SO$_{4}^-$), Phosphate (PO$_{4}^-$) and Silica (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) were determined. The geochemical study of the aquatic systems of the Gadilam river basin show that the groundwater is near-acidic to alkaline and mostly oxidizing in nature. Higher concentration of Sodium and Chloride indicates leaching of secondary salts and anthropogenic impact by industry and salt water intrusion. Spatial distribution of EC indicates anthropogenic impact in the downstream side of the basin. The concentration levels of trace metals such as Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni), Bromide (Br), Iodide (I) and Aluminium (Al) have been compared with the world standard. Interpretation of data shows that some trace metals such as Al, Ni and Pb exceed the acceptable limit of world standard. Geophysical study was carried out to identify the weathered zone in the hard rock and contaminated zone by anthropogenic impact in the downstream of river Gadilam. A few of the groundwater samples in the study area were found to be unsuitable for domestic and drinking purposes.</p>

				<title>Measurement of marine productivity using <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C tracers: Some methodological aspects</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0099-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Various experiments involving the measurement of new, regenerated and total productivity using <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C tracers were carried out in the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and in the Arabian Sea. Results from <sup>15</sup>N tracer experiments indicate that nitrate uptake can be underestimated by experiments with incubation time &gt; 4 hours. Indirect evidence suggests pico- and nano-phytoplankton, on their dominance over microphytoplankton, can also influence the f-ratios. Difference in energy requirement for assimilation of different nitrogen compounds decides the preferred nitrogen source during the early hours of incubation. Variation in light intensity during incubation also plays a significant role in the assimilation of nitrogen. Results from time course experiments with both <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C tracers suggest that photoinhibition appears significant in BOB and the Arabian Sea during noon. A significant correlation has been found in the productivity values obtained using <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C tracers.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary changes in surface productivity and oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the northwestern Arabian Sea: Micropaleontologic and sedimentary record at ODP site 728A</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0113-0121</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Changes in the abundance of selected planktic foraminiferal species and some sedimentological parameters at ODP site 728A were examined to understand the fluctuations in the surface productivity and deep sea oxygenation in the NW Arabian Sea during last ∼540 kyr. The increased relative abundances of high fertility taxa, i.e., <i>Globigerinita glutinata</i> and <i>Globigerina bulloides</i> mainly during interglacial intervals indicate intense upwelling. Strong SW summer monsoon probably increased the upwelling in the western Arabian Sea during interglacial intervals and caused high surface productivities due to the lateral transport of eutrophic waters. Most of the glacial periods (i.e., MIS 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12) are characterized by higher relative abundances of <i>Neogloboquadrina pachyderma</i> and <i>Neogloboquadrina dutertrei</i> associated with <i>Globigerinoides ruber</i>. The more stratified condition and deep mixed layer due to increased NE winter monsoon are mainly responsible for the higher relative abundances of <i>N. pachyderma</i> during glacial periods. Some of the glacial intervals (i.e., MIS 6 and 8) are also characterized by pteropod spikes reflecting deepening of aragonite compensation depth (ACD) and relatively less intense oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in this region due to deep sea mixing and thermocline ventilation, and relatively less intense surface productivity during winter monsoon. The interglacial periods are largely devoid of pteropod shells indicating more aragonite dissolution due to increased intensity of OMZ in the northwestern Arabian Sea.</p>
					<p>In general, the interglacial periods are characterized by low sediment accumulation rates than the glacial intervals. On an average, the total biogenic carbonate percentages were higher during interglacial and during periods of higher surface productivity. Most terrigenous material was trapped on shelf during intervals of high sea level stands of interglacial, whereas more erosion of shelf increased the sedimentation rates during glacial periods. In addition, the fragmentation record may be the result of changes in intensity and vertical distribution of the OMZ with time. During glacial intervals, the lower boundary of the OMZ probably was in a shallower position than during interglacial periods, when dissolution increased as a result of higher organic production. The higher rates of sinking organic matter result into a stronger OMZ as oxygen is used to disintegrate the organic matter. This process lowers the $p^H$ of water which results into increased dissolution of calcium carbonate.</p>

				<title>Sand and clay mineralogy of sal forest soils of the Doon Siwalik Himalayas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0123-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The peteromineralogical characterization of the soil was carried out for the 12 soil profiles exposed in the <i>Shorea robusta</i> dominated forests of the Siwalik forest division, Dehradun. The quartz was observed as the dominating light mineral fraction (64–80%) in all the profiles studied. Biotite, hornblende, zircon, tourmaline, rutile and opaques comprising of iron minerals constituted the heavy mineral fraction (20%). The mineralogy of both the sand and clay fractions revealed a mixed mineralogy. The clay minerals in the order of their dominance were vermiculite, illite, kaolinite and mixed layer minerals. The presence of vermiculite and illite in appreciable quantities indicates that these were synthesized from the K-rich soil solution, as orthoclase and micas were present in significant quantities in the sand minerals. The mineral suites identified in the study shows that the geological, climatological and topographical factors of the region collectively played a dominant role in their formation and transformation. After critical appraisal of the results, it may be deduced that the mineralogical composition, physicochemical properties and total elemental analysis of the soils do not show any deficiency of the bases and other plant nutrients in general. The inherent fertility of the soil is good as indicated by the sand and clay mineralogy of the soil and the biotite and feldspar together with the mica is an important source of nutrients for the vegetation in the soils of the Doon valley.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0145-0155</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Andesite and dacite from Barren and Narcondam volcanic islands of Andaman subduction zone are composed of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, olivine, titanomagnetite, magnesio-hornblende and rare quartz grains. In this study, we use the results of mineral chemical analyses of the calc-alkaline rock suite of rocks as proxies for magma mixing and mingling processes. Plagioclase, the most dominant mineral, shows zoning which includes oscillatory, patchy, multiple and repetitive zonation and ‘fritted’ or ‘sieve’ textures. Zoning patterns in plagioclase phenocrysts and abrupt fluctuations in An content record different melt conditions in a dynamic magma chamber. ‘Fritted’ zones (An<sub>55</sub>) are frequently overgrown by thin calcic (An<sub>72</sub>) plagioclase rims over well-developed dissolution surfaces. These features have probably resulted from mixing of a more silicic magma with the host andesite. Olivine and orthopyroxene with reaction and overgrowth rims (corona) suggest magma mixing processes. We conclude that hybrid magma formed from the mixing of mafic and felsic magma by two-stage processes initial intrusion of hotter mafic melt (andesitic) followed by cooler acidic melt at later stage.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the role of rock properties in the development of potholes: A case study of the Indrayani knickpoint, Maharashtra</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0157-0165</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The most conspicuous erosional features associated with constricted bedrock channel reaches and knickpoints are potholes. The presence and morphology of potholes have been attributed to a number of factors by earlier researchers. Amongst these factors, the role of substrate rock properties has received very little quantitative attention. The main objective of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the physical properties of bedrock in order to test the possible influences of rock properties on the occurrence and morphology of potholes. The area selected for this study is a large scabland area developed by the Indrayani river at Shelarwadi near Pune. This site is ideally suited for the study since it is featured by wide straths, multiple inner channels and several hundred potholes. A transect-based quadrat method was used in this study. Within each quadrat, the pothole dimensions, the joint length, joint direction, the rock mass strength and the distance from active channel were measured. The analysis reveals a weak correlation between pothole size and rock properties. The distance from the active channel emerges as the most significant factor, suggesting that the hydraulics of flows is the key factor and substrate characteristics play only a secondary role.</p>

				<title>Palaeoseismicity in relation to basin tectonics as revealed from soft-sediment deformation structures of the Lower Triassic Panchet formation, Raniganj basin (Damodar valley), eastern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0167-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Raniganj basin in the Damodar valley of eastern India is located within the riftogenic Gondwana Master-Basin. The fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the Lower Triassic Panchet Formation of the Damodar valley in the study area preserve various soft-sediment deformation structures such as slump folds, convolute laminae, flame structures, dish-and-pillar structures, sandstone dykes, pseudonodules and syn-sedimentary faults. Although such soft-sediment deformation structures maybe formed by various processes, in the present area the association of these structures, their relation to the adjacent sedimentary rocks and the tectonic and depositional setting of the formation suggest that these structures are seismogenic. Movements along the basin margin and the intra-basinal faults and resultant seismicity with moderate magnitude (2–5 on Richter scale) are thought to have been responsible for the soft-sediment deformations.</p>

				<title>Influence of shear velocity on frictional characteristics of rock surface</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0183-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding the fundamental issues related with the effect of shear velocity on frictional characteristics at the interface of rock surfaces is an important issue. In this paper, strain-rate dependence on friction is investigated in relation to sliding behaviour under normal load. The phenomenon of stick-slip of granite and shaly sandstone with a tribometer at constant rate of strain under normal loads was observed.</p>
					<p>Friction at the interface of the rock samples was developed by increasing shear strain at a constant rate by applying constant velocity using the tribometer. For shaly sandstone, state parameters (𝑎 and 𝑏) played a major role in determining the friction values and roughness of the contact surfaces as well. Higher values of 𝑏 for shaly sandstone may be attributed to the fact that its surface had a greater number of pronounced asperities. Rubbing between the surfaces does not mean that surface becomes smoother. This is because of variation of friction between surfaces.</p>

				<title>Slab detachment of subducted Indo-Australian plate beneath Sunda arc, Indonesia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0193-0204</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Necking, tearing, slab detachment and subsequently slab loss complicate the subduction zone processes and slab architecture. Based on evidences which include patterns of seismicity, seismic tomography and geochemistry of arc volcanoes, we have identified a horizontal slab tear in the subducted Indo-Australian slab beneath the Sunda arc. It strongly reflects on trench migration, and causes along-strike variations in vertical motion and geochemically distinct subduction-related arc magmatism. We also propose a model for the geodynamic evolution of slab detachment.</p>

				<title>One-dimensional unsteady solute transport along unsteady flow through inhomogeneous medium</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0205-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The one-dimensional linear advection–diffusion equation is solved analytically by using the Laplace integral transform. The solute transport as well as the flow field is considered to be unsteady, both of independent patterns. The solute dispersion occurs through an inhomogeneous semi-infinite medium. Hence, velocity is considered to be an increasing function of the space variable, linearly interpolated in a finite domain in which solute dispersion behaviour is studied. Dispersion is considered to be proportional to the square of the spatial linear function. Thus, the coefficients of the advection–diffusion equation are functions of both the independent variables, but the expression for each coefficient is considered in degenerate form. These coefficients are reduced into constant coefficients with the help of a new space variable, introduced in our earlier works, and new time variables. The source of the solute is considered to be a stationary uniform point source of pulse type.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Accuracies of Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning (RTK-GPS) system and Total Station (TS) were investigated in GIS environment. In geostatistical evaluations, Kriging method was used with spherical, exponential, and Gaussian models. The survey results demonstrated that an area of 3.5 ha or smaller can be best explained with Gaussian model, while the larger areas require a spherical model. A vertical error of 60 cm and a horizontal error of 30 cm can be observed when the survey points outside the construction area are eliminated. The optimum area per survey point was calculated to be 20 &#215; 20 m<sup>2</sup> to increase the accuracy. This case study showed that an inaccurate survey can result cost over estimations up to 27%.</p>

				<title>1420 Ma diabasic intrusives from the Mesoproterozoic Singhora Group, Chhattisgarh Supergroup, India: Implications towards non-plume intrusive activity</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0223-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Besides offering significant clues towards tracking the geochemical evolution of the mantle and architectural reconstruction of different ‘supercontinent’, geochronological and geochemical appraisal of igneous inputs are also important to bracket the depositional time frame of any lithopackage, particularly, the unfossiliferous sedimentary successions. The present study deals with diabasic intrusive within Mesoproterozoic Saraipalli Formation, which is an argillaceous constituent present at the basal part of nearly 400 m thick four-tiered unmetamorphosed but deformed sedimentary succession of Singhora Group, Chhattisgarh Supergroup, central India. The SE–NW trending intrusive comprises mainly of plagioclase and augite together with minor orthopyroxene, biotite and opaque minerals. Though some plagioclase laths are partially sericitized, the ophitic-to-subophitic texture of the rock is well preserved. Major and trace element geochemical data indicate that this intrusive is basalt-to-basaltic andesite in character and of subalkaline basalt affinity. Multi-element plot shows overall LILE-enrichment and enrichment of Pb and slight depletion of Nb and P, coupled with moderate La/Nb and Th/Nb ratios. Zr, Y and Nb ternary diagrams plot in the fields of within plate basalt. Selected HFSE ratios indicate a non-plume source with crustal assimilation/sediment mixing. Sm–Nd and Rb–Sr isotope data show that the intrusive has Srinitial and Ndinitial of 0.709377–0.706672 and 0.510919–0.510815, respectively. Positive 𝜀<sup>t</sup>Nd [<i>t</i> = 1420 Ma] values (+0.3 to + 2.3) indicate depleted isotopic nature of their protolith. The calculated $T_{DM}$ age is 1.7–1.9 Ga. The mineral-whole rock isochron data (Sm–Nd systematics) of the intrusive implies an emplacement age of ca. 1420 Ma. Considering synchronous terrain boundary shear zone development in Bastar craton on the southeastern part of the Singhora basin, mafic magmatism in Eastern Ghats and large-scale basic intrusion in Sausar mobile belt, a major tectono-thermal event around 1400 Ma is surmised that affected eastern Indian craton. Moreover, geochronology of a bedded porcellanite unit (ca. 1500 Ma) at the base and a discordant basic intrusive (ca. 1420 Ma) allowed a unique opportunity to qualitatively offer an upper bound of time bracket for the deposition of Saraipalli Formation, i.e., ∼80 Ma.</p>

				<title>Geochemical and Sm–Nd isotopic study of titanite from granitoid rocks of the eastern Dharwar craton, southern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0237-0251</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Titanite occurs as an accessory phase in a variety of igneous rocks, and is known to concentrate geologically important elements such as U, Th, rare earth element (REE), Y and Nb. The differences in the abundances of the REEs contained in titanite from granitoid rocks could reflect its response to changes in petrogenetic variables such as temperature of crystallization, pressure, composition, etc. Widespread migmatization in the granodiorite gneisses occurring to the east of Kolar and Ramagiri schist belts of the eastern Dharwar craton resulted in the enrichment of the REEs in titanite relative to their respective host rocks. A compositional influence on the partitioning of REEs between titanite and the host rock/magma is also noticed. The relative enrichment of REEs in titanite from quartz monzodiorite is lower than that found in the granodioritic gneiss. Depletion of REE and HFSE (high field-strength elements) abundances in granitic magmas that have equilibrated with titanite during fractional crystallization or partial melting has been modelled. As little as 1% of titanite present in residual phases during partial melting or in residual melts during fractional crystallization can significantly lower the abundances of trace elements such as Nb, Y, Zr and REE which implies the significance of this accessory mineral as a controlling factor in trace element distribution in granitoid rocks. Sm–Nd isotope studies on titanite, hornblende and whole rock yield isochron ages comparable to the precise U–Pb titanite ages, invoking the usefulness of Sm–Nd isochron ages involving minerals like titanite.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Saddle-shaped reticulate <i>Nummulites</i> from the Early Oligocene rocks of Khari area, SW Kutch, India is reported here for the first time. Unusual shape of this <i>Nummulites</i> is due to the curved nature of the coiling plane, indicating space constrained postembryonic test growth. With regular development of chambers, septa and septal filaments, the saddle-shaped <i>Nummulites</i> constitutes the third morphotype of <i>N.</i> cf. <i>fichteli</i> Michelotti form A. Other morphotypes of the species reported earlier include inflated lenticular and conical tests. Multiple morphotypes of <i>N.</i> cf. <i>fichteli</i> form A indicates varied test growth in response to substrate conditions. Morphological variability exhibited by <i>N.</i> cf. <i>fichteli</i> form A from Kutch and some Early Oligocene reticulate <i>Nummulites</i> from the Far East are comparable. This faunal suite is morphologically distinct from the contemporary reticulate <i>Nummulites</i> of the European localities.</p>

				<title>Role of dynamics in the advection of aerosols over the Arabian Sea along the west coast of peninsular India during pre-monsoon season: A case study based on satellite data and regional climate model</title>

				<page>0269-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The circulation dynamics of an event marked by the formation of an aerosol cluster off the coast of Maharashtra on April 22, 2006, its southward migration along the Indian west coast with a mean speed of ∼200 km/day and its final dissipation after reaching the end of the peninsula by April 28, 2006 as revealed by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) against the pre-monsoon conditions of April 2006 are examined in this study. The maximum aerosol concentration in the cluster was found getting confined to lower and lower altitudes during its southward movement. The NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis wind field indicates that the atmospheric circulation, especially the horizontal wind convergence is the major factor that guides the formation and the dynamics of the cluster. Fine mode fraction from MODIS suggests that the cluster mainly consists of coarse dust particles. The regional climate model, RegCM3 with an efficient dust generation module simulates the formation and movement of the cluster appreciably well. The simulations which also exhibit the altitudinally descending nature of the cluster during its southward movement confirm the mechanism which governs the cluster dynamics suggested based on MODIS and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data.</p>

The monitoring was carried out from midnight-to-midnight in every alternate day on a fortnightly basis to represent summer, monsoon and winter (autumn) seasons of 2008 at Mohal (1154 m amsl) and Kothi (2530 m amsl) in Kullu-Manali area of the northwestern Himalayan region of India. The results indicate that diurnal pattern has faint bimodal structure with two peaks, one in morning and the other in evening at both the sites but it is not as distinct as found in plains. There is rather a constant particle density pattern of large magnitude consistent with vehicular movement from morning till evening. The monthly 24 h average particle density gradually picks up from January, increases rapidly in summer months and then decreases in monsoon season at Mohal but at Kothi it keeps on rising from April to October with a slight more increase in September. The particle density is more in summer than in monsoon season at Mohal, a trend opposite to plains. It may be due to the development of warm thermal layer on valley floor while a cold layer develops along snowy hilltops in winter leading to convection of fine particle up the slopes of valley during daytime. At Kothi, the trend is same as it is in continental plains but opposite to Mohal. The relatively more value of particle density in September and October at both the sites may be due to month long International Kullu Dussehra fair in the valley. The vehicular survey conducted agrees well with entire study period averaged diurnal variations and monthly 24 h averaged value of fine particle density. The average value of ultrafine particle density at each hour of a day for entire study period is 20369 ± 1230 Ncm<sup>−3</sup> and 14389 ± 1464 Ncm<sup>−3</sup> at Mohal and Kothi sites, respectively. The comparison with earlier results shows a significant increase indicating impact of vehicular onslaught on pure air of this hilly region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A critical analysis has been made on the long-term yearly and seasonal variations of ozone concentration at Varanasi (25&#176;N, 83&#176;E), India and Halley Bay (76&#176;S, 27&#176;W), a British Antarctic Service Station. The effect of O<sub>3</sub> depletion on night airglow emission of Li 6708 ˚A line at Varanasi and Halley Bay has been studied. Calculations based on chemical kinetics show that the airglow intensity of Li 6708 ˚A line has also been affected due to the depletion of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The yearly variations and seasonal variations of intensities of Li 6708 ˚A line for the above two stations are shown and compared. It has been shown that the rate of decrease of intensity of Li 6708 ˚A line was comparatively more at Halley Bay due to dramatic decrease of Antarctic O<sub>3</sub> concentration.</p>

					<p>Features of the equatorial electrojet are studied at Sao Luiz (2.6&#176;S, 44.2&#176;W, inclination $−$0.25&#176;) in eastern Brazil and Sikasso (11.3&#176;N, 5.7&#176;W, inclination 0.1&#176;) in the western African sector. The stations are situated on either side of the lowest magnetic field intensity in the region of rapid changes in the declination. The daily variations of 𝛥 X at the two stations are almost similar with the peak around noon with maximum values during equinoxes and minimum values during J-solstices. Daily variations of 𝛥 Y differ with the maximum deviation of about −35 nT around noon at Sao Luiz and much smaller value of about −10 nT around 14 h LT for Sikasso. The direction of the 𝐻 vector varies from 15&#176;W of north at 08 h to more than 30&#176;W of north at 17 h for Sao Luiz and from 14&#176;E of north to 25&#176;W of north at 18 h for Sikasso. The plot of the deviations in 𝛥 X and 𝛥 Y at different hours for the two stations shows the points along narrow ellipses with major axis aligned along 22&#176;W of north for Sao Luiz and along 3&#176;W of north for Sikasso as compared to declination of 20&#176;W for Sao Luiz and 6&#176;W for Sikasso. The deviations in 𝛥 X at the two stations are fairly well correlated.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric stability index using radio occultation refractivity profiles</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0311-0319</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new stability index based on atmospheric refractivity at ∼500 hPa level and surface measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity is formulated. The new index named here as refractivity based lifted index (RLI) is designed to give similar results as traditionally used lifted index derived from radiosonde profiles of temperature, pressure and humidity. The formulation of the stability index and its comparison with the traditional temperature profile based lifted index (LI) is discussed. The index is tested on COSMIC radio occultation derived refractivity profiles over Indian region. The forecast potential of the new index for rainfall on 2&#176; &#215; 2&#176; latitude–longitude spatial scale with lead time of 3–24 hours indicate that the refractivity based lifted index works better than the traditional temperature based lifted index for the Indian monsoon region. Decreasing values of RLI tend to give increasing rainfall probabilities.</p>

				<title>Spectral characterization of soil and coal contamination on snow reflectance using hyperspectral analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0321-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Snow is a highly reflecting object found naturally on the Earth and its albedo is highly influenced by the amount and type of contamination. In the present study, two major types of contaminants (soil and coal) have been used to understand their effects on snow reflectance in the Himalayan region. These contaminants were used in two categories quantitatively – addition in large quantity and addition in small quantity. Snow reflectance data were collected between 350 and 2500 nm spectral ranges and binned at 10 nm interval by averaging. The experiment was designed to gather the field information in controlled conditions, and radiometric observations were collected. First derivative, band absorption depth, asymmetry, percentage change in reflectance and albedo in optical region were selected to identify and discriminate the type of contamination. Band absorption depth has shown a subtle increasing pattern for soil contamination, however, it was significant for small amounts of coal contamination. The absorption peak asymmetry was not significant for soil contamination but showed a nature towards left asymmetry for coal. The width of absorption feature at 1025 nm was not significant for both the contaminations. The percentage change in reflectance was quite high for small amount of coal contamination rather than soil contamination, however, a shift of peak was observed in soil-contaminated snow which was not present in coal contamination. The albedo drops exponentially for coal contamination rather than soil contamination.</p>

				<title>Study of inter-annual variations in surface melting over Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica, using space-borne scatterometer data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0329-0336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The widespread retreat of glaciers can be considered as a response to the climate change. Being the largest retreating glacier–ice shelf system in East Antarctica, the Amery Ice Shelf–Lambert Glacier system plays an important role in contributing to sea level rise as well as the surrounding environment and climate. The present study is focused on the investigation of surface melting over the ice shelf using QuikSCAT Ku-band scatterometer data for more than 100 months covering the period from January 2000 to July 2009. The corresponding weather data of Davis Station was obtained from the website of Australian Antarctic Division. Very prominent dips in the backscatter observed in the month of January form a distinct signature caused by physical process of significant melting of the ice/snow surface. The steep increase again in February is attributed to the initiation of the freezing phenomenon. The  derived melting index compared well with the passive microwave-based melting index derived by other researchers. A strong relationship was found between the scatterometer-derived melting index and the cumulative monthly mean air temperature. The highest melting was observed in the summer (January) of 2004, and thereafter gradual cooling appeared to take place in the subsequent years. The snow pack thickness, inferred from the backscatter variations, was found to be higher during winters (June) of 2004 and 2005, compared with other years.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric correction for sea surface temperature retrieval from single thermal channel radiometer data onboard Kalpana satellite</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0337-0345</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An atmospheric correction method has been applied on sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval algorithm using Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) single window channel radiance data onboard Kalpana satellite (K-SAT). The technique makes use of concurrent water vapour fields available from Microwave Imager onboard Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM/TMI) satellite. Total water vapour content and satellite zenith angle dependent SST retrieval algorithm has been developed using Radiative Transfer Model [MODTRAN ver3.0] simulations for Kalpana 10.5–12.5 𝜇m thermal window channel. Retrieval of Kalpana SST (K-SST) has been carried out for every half-hourly acquisition of Kalpana data for the year 2008 to cover whole annual cycle of SST over Indian Ocean (IO). Validation of the retrieved corrected SST has been carried out using near-simultaneous observations of ship and buoys datasets covering Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and IO regions. A significant improvement in Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of K-SST with respect to buoy (1.50–1.02 K) and to ship datasets (1.41–1.19 K) is seen with the use of near real-time water vapour fields of TMI. Furthermore, comparison of the retrieved SST has also been carried out using near simultaneous observations of TRMM/TMI SST over IO regions. The analysis shows that K-SST has overall cold bias of 1.17 K and an RMSD of 1.09 K after bias correction.</p>

				<title>Volatile properties of atmospheric aerosols during nucleation events at Pune, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0347-0357</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Continuous measurements of aerosol size distributions in the mid-point diameter range 20.5–500 nm were made from October 2005 to March 2006 at Pune (18&#176; 32&#8242;N, 73&#176; 51&#8242;E), India using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). Volatilities of atmospheric aerosols were also measured at 40&#176;, 125&#176;, 175&#176;, 300&#176; and 350&#176;C temperatures with Thermodenuder–SMPS coupled system to determine aerosol volatile fractions. Aerosols in nucleated, CCN and accumulated modes are characterized from the measured percentage of particles volatized at 40&#176;, 125&#176;, 175&#176;, 300&#176; and 350&#176;C temperatures. Averaged monthly aerosol concentration is at its maximum in November and gradually decreases to its minimum at the end of March. The diurnal variations of aerosol concentrations gradually decrease in the night and in early morning hours (0400–0800 hr). However, concentration attains minimum in its variations in the noon (1400–1600 hr) due to higher ventilation factor (product of mixing height and wind speed). The half an hour averaged diurnal variation of aerosol number concentration shows about 5 to 10-fold increase despite the ventilation factor at higher side before 1200 hr. This sudden increase in aerosol concentrations is linked with prevailing conditions for nucleation bursts. The measurement of volatile fraction of ambient aerosols reveals that there are large number of highly volatile particles in the Aitken mode in the morning hours and these volatile fractions of aerosols at temperatures &gt; 150&#176;C are of ammonium chloride and ammonium sulfate, acetic and formic acids.</p>

				<page>0359-0373</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrence of exceptionally heavy rainfall events and associated flash floods in many areas during recent years motivate us to study long-term changes in extreme rainfall over India. The analysis of the frequency of rainy days, rain days and heavy rainfall days as well as one-day extreme rainfall and return period has been carried out in this study to observe the impact of climate change on extreme rainfall events and flood risk in India. The frequency of heavy rainfall events are decreasing in major parts of central and north India while they are increasing in peninsular, east and north east India. The study tries to bring out some of the interesting findings which are very useful for hydrological planning and disaster managements. Extreme rainfall and flood risk are increasing significantly in the country except some parts of central India.</p>

				<title>Uncertainties in downscaled relative humidity for a semi-arid region in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0375-0386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Monthly scenarios of relative humidity (𝑅_H) were obtained for the Malaprabha river basin in India using a statistical downscaling technique. Large-scale atmospheric variables (air temperature and specific humidity at 925 mb, surface air temperature and latent heat flux) were chosen as predictors. The predictor variables are extracted from the (1) National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis dataset for the period 1978–2000, and (2) simulations of the third generation Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model for the period 1978–2100. The objective of this study was to investigate the uncertainties in regional scenarios developed for RH due to the choice of emission scenarios (A1B, A2, B1 and COMMIT) and the predictors selected. Multi-linear regression with stepwise screening is the downscaling technique used in this study. To study the uncertainty in the regional scenarios of 𝑅_H, due to the selected predictors, eight sets of predictors were chosen and a downscaling model was developed for each set. Performance of the downscaling models in the baseline period (1978–2000) was studied using three measures (1) Nash–Sutcliffe error estimate (𝐸_f ), (2) mean absolute error (MAE), and (3) product moment correlation (𝑃). Results show that the performances vary between 0.59 and 0.68, 0.42 and 0.50 and 0.77 and 0.82 for 𝐸_f , MAE and P. Cumulative distribution functions were prepared from the regional scenarios of 𝑅_H developed for combinations of predictors and emission scenarios. Results show a variation of 1 to 6% 𝑅_H in the scenarios developed for combination of predictor sets for baseline period. For a future period (2001–2100), a variation of 6 to 15% 𝑅_H was observed for the combination of emission scenarios and predictors. The variation was highest for A2 scenario and least for COMMIT and B1 scenario.</p>

					<p>The objective of this study is to apply and test a simple parametric water balance model for prediction of soil moisture regime in the presence of vegetation. The intention was to evaluate the differences in model parameterization and performance when applied to small watersheds under three different types of land covers (<i>Acacia</i>, degraded forest and natural forest). The watersheds selected for this purpose are located in the sub-humid climate within the Western Ghats, Karnataka, India. Model calibration and validation were performed using a dataset comprising depth-averaged soil moisture content measurements made at weekly time steps from October 2004 to December 2008. In addition to this, a sensitivity analysis was carried out with respect to the water-holding capacity of the soils with the aim of explaining the suitability and adaptation of exotic vegetation types under the prevailing climatic conditions. Results indicated reasonably good performance of the model in simulating the pattern and magnitude of weekly average soil moisture content in 150 cm deep soil layer under all three land covers. This study demonstrates that a simple, robust and parametrically parsimonious model is capable of simulating the temporal dynamics of soil moisture content under distinctly different land covers. Also, results of sensitivity analysis revealed that exotic plant species such as <i>Acacia</i> have adapted themselves effectively to the local climate.</p>

				<title>Assessing variability of water quality in a groundwater-fed perennial lake of Kashmir Himalayas using linear geostatics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0399-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a study on Manasbal lake, which is one of the high altitude lakes in the KashmirValley, India. Eighteen water samples were analysed for major ions and trace elements to assess the variability of water quality of the lake for various purposes. Geostatistics, the theory of regionalized variables, was then used to enhance the dataset and estimate some missing spatial values. Resultsindicated that the concentration of major ions in the water samples in winter was higher than in summer. The scatter diagrams suggested the dominance of alkaline earths over the alkali elements. Three types of water were identified in the lake that are referred to as Ca–HCO<sub>3</sub>, Mg–HCO<sub>3</sub> and hybrid types. The lake water was found to be controlled by rock–water interaction with carbonate lithology as a dominant source of the solutes. The major (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub> and HCO$^{−}_{3}$, CO<sub>3</sub> and Cl) and trace elements of the lake water were within the World Health Organization standards, therefore the lake water was considered chemically safe for drinking purposes. Although NO<sub>3</sub> concentration (ranging from 1.72 to 2 mg/L), is within the permissible limit and not very alarming, the gradually increasing trend is not acceptable. It is however, important to guard its spatio-temporal variability as the water is used for domestic as well as agricultural purposes. This study is significant as hydrogeological information on such high altitude lakes in India is scanty.</p>

				<title>Application and evaluation of universal kriging for optimal contouring of groundwater levels</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0413-0422</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the application of universal kriging to interpolate water table elevations from their measurements at random locations. Geographic information system tools were used to generate the continuous surface of water table elevations for the Carlsbad area alluvial aquifer located to the southeast of New Mexico, USA.Water table elevations in the 38 monitoring wells that are common to 1996 and 2003 irrigation years follows normal distribution. A generalized MATLAB^® code was developed to generate omni-directional and directional semi-variograms (at 22.5&#176; intervals). Low-order polynomials were used to model the trend as the water table profile exhibits a south-east gradient. Different theoretical semivariogram models were tried to select the base semi-variogram for performing geostatistical interpolation. The contour maps of water table elevations exhibit significant decrease in the water table from 1996 to 2003. Statistical analysis performed on the estimated contours revealed that the decrease in water table is between 0.6 and 4.5 m at 90% confidence. The estimation variance contours show that the error in estimation was more than 8m<sup>2</sup> in the west and south-west portions of the aquifer due to the absence of monitoring wells.</p>

				<title>Geospatial tools for assessing land degradation in Budgam district, Kashmir Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0423-0433</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Land degradation reduces the ability of the land to perform many biophysical and chemical functions. The main aim of this study was to determine the status of land degradation in the Budgam area of Kashmir Himalaya using remote sensing and geographic information system. The satellite data together with other geospatial datasets were used to quantify different categories of land degradation. The results were validated in the field and an accuracy of 85% was observed. Land use/land cover of the study area was determined in order to know the effect of land use on the rate of land degradation. Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and slope of the area were determined using LANDSAT-enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) data, advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer, and digital elevation model along with other secondary data were analysed to create various thematic maps, viz., land use/land cover, geology, NDVI and slopes used in modelling land degradation in the Kashmir Himalayan region. The vegetation condition, elevation and land use/land cover information of the area were integrated to assess the land degradation scenario in the area using the ArcGIS ‘Spatial Analyst Module’. The results reveal that about 13.19% of the study area has undergone moderate to high degradation, whereas about 44.12% of the area has undergone slight degradation.</p>

				<title>Threat of land subsidence in and around Kolkata City and East Kolkata Wetlands, West Bengal, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0435-0446</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper attempts to estimate the possible rate of land subsidence of Kolkata City including Salt Lake City and the adjoining East Kolkata Wetlands located at the lower part of the deltaic alluvial plain of South Bengal basin. Demand of groundwater for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes has increased due to rapid urbanization. The subsurface geology consists of Quaternary sediments comprising a succession of clay, silty clay and sand of various grades. Groundwater occurs mostly under confined condition except in those places where the top aquitard has been obliterated due to the scouring action of past channels. Currently, the piezometric head shows a falling trend and it may be accelerated due to further over-withdrawal of groundwater resulting in land subsidence. The estimated mean land subsidence rate is 13.53 mm/year and for 1 m drop in the piezometric head, the mean subsidence is 3.28 cm. The surface expression of the estimated land subsidence is however, cryptic because of a time lag between the settlement of the thick low-permeable aquitard at the top and its surface expression. Therefore, groundwater of the cities and wetland areas should be developed cautiously based on the groundwater potential to minimize the threat of land subsidence.</p>

				<title>Elastic thickness estimates at north east passive margin of North America and its implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0447-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Global estimates of the elastic thickness (Te) of the structure of passive continental margins show wide and varying results owing to the use of different methodologies. Earlier estimates of the elastic thickness of the North Atlantic passive continental margins that used flexural modelling yielded a Te value of ∼20–100 km. Here, we compare these estimates with the Te value obtained using orthonormalized Hermite multitaper recovered isostatic coherence functions. We discuss how Te is correlated with heat flow distribution and depth of necking. The E–W segment in the southern study region comprising Nova Scotia and the Southern Grand Banks show low Te values, while the zones comprising the NE–SW zones, viz., Western Greenland, Labrador, Orphan Basin and the Northern Grand Bank show comparatively high Te values. As expected, Te broadly reflects the depth of the 200$–$400&#176;C isotherm below the weak surface sediment layer at the time of loading, and at the margins most of the loading occurred during rifting. We infer that these low Te measurements indicate Te frozen into the lithosphere. This could be due to the passive nature of the margin when the loads were emplaced during the continental break-up process at high temperature gradients.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry and petrogenesis of Neoproterozoic Mylliem granitoids, Meghalaya Plateau, northeastern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0459-0473</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Mylliem granitoids of the Meghalaya Plateau, northeastern India, represent one of the disharmonic Neoproterozoic igneous plutons, which are intrusive into low-grade Shillong Group of metasediments. Field studies indicate that the Mylliem granitoids cover an area of about 40 km<sup>2</sup> and is characterized by development of variable attitude of primary foliations mostly marked along the margin of the pluton. Xenoliths of both Shillong Group of metasediments and mafic rocks have been found to occur within Mylliem granitoids. Structural study of the primary foliation is suggestive of funnel-shaped intrusion of Mylliem granitoids with no appreciable evidence of shearing. Petrographically, Mylliem granitoids are characterized by pink to white phenocrysts of prismatic microcline/perthite and lath-shaped plagioclase (An<sub>20</sub>$–$An<sub>29</sub>). Groundmass material is characterized by quartz, microcline, plagioclase, muscovite and biotite. Sphene and apatite occur as accessory minerals. Petrographically Mylliem granitoids have been discriminated as granite and granodiorite according to IUGS system of classification.</p>
					<p>Critical evaluation of geochemical data and variation trends of major oxides/trace elements suggests a significant role of fractional crystallization in the evolution of Mylliem pluton. Th/U ratios (3.22–6.77) indicate a relatively higher abundance of Th over U. Chondrite-normalized REE diagram characteristically shows an enriched LREE pattern and prominent negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.16–0.42) indicating the significant role of plagioclase fractionation from the parent magma. An overall strong REE fractionation pattern has been envisaged for Mylliem granitoids. The strong REE fractionation of the Mylliem granitoids is depicted by (Ce/Yb)$_N$ values, which show a range of 1.39 to 1.65. The aluminium saturation index (ASI) (ranging from 1.0 to 1.3), A/CNK ratios (ranging from 1.4 to 2.11) and A/NK ratios (ranging from 1.75 to 2.43) provide evidences for the peraluminous, S-type nature of the Mylliem granitoids. The peraluminous, S-type character is further supported by geochemical parameters such as Fe* and MALI (modified alkali lime index). Normative corundum &lt; 1.0 wt.% is suggestive of the S-type nature of Mylliem granitoids. This is indicative of parent melt-extraction from metasedimentary source rocks by partial melting. Distinct geochemical parameters suggest a post-orogenic tectonic environment for the Mylliem granitoids. The peraluminous, calc-alkalic to alkali-calcic, post-orogenic Mylliem granitoids are geochemically correlatable with the post-orogenic Caledonian granitoids of Ireland and Britain.</p>

				<title>Chemical and sulphur isotope compositions of pyrite in the Jaduguda U (–Cu–Fe) deposit, Singhbhum shear zone, eastern India: Implications for sulphide mineralization</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0475-0488</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Jaduguda U (–Cu–Fe) deposit in the Singhbhum shear zone has been the most productive uranium deposit in India. Pyrite occurs as disseminated grains or in sulphide stringers and veins in the ore zone. Veins, both concordant and discordant to the pervasive foliation, are mineralogically either simple comprising pyrite ± chalcopyrite or complex comprising pyrite + chalcopyrite + pentlandite + millerite. Nickel-sulphide minerals, though fairly common in concordant veins, are very rare in the discordant veins. Pyrite in Ni-sulphide association is commonly replaced by pentlandite at the grain boundary or along micro-cracks.</p>
					<p>Based on concentrations of Co and Ni, pyrite is classified as: type-A &#8212; high Co (up to 30800 ppm), no/low Ni; type-B &#8212; moderate Co (up to 16500 ppm) and moderate to high Ni (up to 32700 ppm); type-C &#8212; no/low Co and high Ni (up to 43000 ppm); type-D &#8212; neither Co nor Ni. Textural and compositional data of pyrites suggest that the hydrothermal fluid responsible for pre-/early-shearing mineralization evolved from Co-rich to Ni-rich and the late-/post-shearing fluid was largely depleted in minor elements. Sulphur isotope compositions of pyrite mostly furnish positive values ranging between -0.33 and 12.06%. Composite samples of pyrites with only type-A compositions and mixed samples of type-A and type-B are consistently positive. However, pyrite with mixed type-A and type-C and pyrite with type-D compositions have negative values but close to 0. By integrating minor element and sulphur isotope compositions of pyrite in conjunction with other published data on the Jaduguda deposit, it is proposed that reduced sulphur for the precipitation of most pyrites (type-A, type-B) was likely derived from isotopically heavy modified seawater. However, some later sulphur might be magmatic in origin remobilized from existing sulphides in the mafic volcanic rocks in the shear zone.</p>

				<title>Petrography, geochemistry and regional significance of crystalline klippen in the Garhwal Lesser Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0489-0501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Uphalda gneisses (UG) is a crystalline klippe located near Srinagar in Garhwal Himalaya. These gneisses are compared with Debguru porphyroids (DP) (≈ Ramgarh group) of Garhwal–Kumaun Himalaya and Baragaon mylonitic gneisses (BMG) of Himachal Himalaya. Petrographic study reveals that the deformation of UG was initiated at higher temperature (above 350&#176;C) and continued till lowering of temperature and deformation led to the mylonitization.</p>
					<p>Geochemically, these granitic gneisses (UG, DP and BMG) exhibit similar composition. Features such as high molecular A/CNK value (&lt; 1), presence of normative corundum and absence of normative diopside, enhanced Rb/Sr, Rb/Zr ratios, enrichment of Th and containing rounded zircons support their crustally-derived S-type granitic nature. The linear plot in major oxides is interpreted in terms of fractional crystallization processes. Mantle normalized multi-element spider diagram of UG illustrates depletion of Ba, Nb, Sr, P and Ti and enrichment of Th and show similarities with DP and BMG.</p>
					<p>Similarities were observed in lithology, petrographic characters and chemical composition of UG, DP, BMG and Ulleri augen gneisses (Nepal). Comparison with the rocks of Higher Himalayan crystallines (≈ Vaikrita), suggests that these rocks (UG) are not transported from Higher Himalaya as understood earlier. This study however proposes that, these gneissic bodies represent an older basement occurring as a tectonic sliver which emplaced within the cover sequence as wedges at different structural levels. This is a regional phenomena observed throughout the Lesser Himalayan region.</p>

				<title>Methods for determination of the age of Pleistocene tephra, derived from eruption of Toba, in central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0503-0530</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tephra, emplaced as a result of Pleistocene eruption of the Indonesian ‘supervolcano’ Toba, occurs at many localities in India. However, the ages of these deposits have hitherto been contentious; some workers have argued that these deposits mark the most recent eruption (eruption A, ca 75 ka), although at some sites they are stratigraphically associated with Acheulian (Lower Palaeolithic) artefacts. Careful examination of the geochemical composition of the tephras, which are composed predominantly of shards of rhyolitic glass, indicates that discrimination between the products of eruption A and eruption D (ca 790 ka) of Toba is difficult. Nonetheless, this comparison favours eruption D as the source of the tephra deposits at some sites in India, supporting the long-held view that the Lower Palaeolithic of India spans the late Early Pleistocene. In principle, these tephra deposits should be dateable using the K–Ar system; however, previous experience indicates contamination by a small proportion of ancient material, resulting in apparent ages that exceed the true ages of the tephras. We have established the optimum size-fraction in which the material from Toba is concentrated, 53–61 𝜇m, and have considered possible origins for the observed contamination. We also demonstrate that Ar–Ar analysis of four out of five of our samples has yielded material with an apparent age similar to that expected for eruption D. These numerical ages, of 809 ± 51, 714 ± 62, 797 ± 45 and 827 ± 39 ka for the tephras at Morgaon, Bori, Gandhigram and Simbhora, provide a weighted mean age for this eruption of 799 ± 24 ka (plus-or-minus two standard deviations). However, these numerical ages are each derived from no more than 10–20% of the argon release in each sample, which is not ideal. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that it is feasible, in principle, to date this difficult material using the Ar–Ar technique; future follow-up studies will therefore be able to refine our preparation and analysis procedures to better optimize the dating.</p>

				<title>Paleochannel and paleohydrology of a Middle Siwalik (Pliocene) fluvial system, northern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0531-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Late Cenozoic fresh water molasses sediments (+6000 m thick) deposited all along the length of the Himalayan fore deep, form the Siwalik Supergroup. This paper reports the results of the paleodrainage and paleohydrology of the Middle Siwalik subgroup of rocks, deposited in non-marine basins adjacent to a rising mountain chain during Pliocene. Well-exposed sections of these rocks have provided adequate paleodrainage data for the reconstruction of paleochannel morphology and paleohydrological attributes of the Pliocene fluvial system.</p>
					<p>Cross-bedding data has been used as inputs to estimate bankfull channel depth and channel sinuosity of Pliocene rivers. Various empirical relationships of modern rivers were used to estimate other paleohydrological attributes such as channel width, sediment load parameter, annual discharge, and channel slope and flow velocity. Computed channel depth, channel slope and flow velocity are supported independently by recorded data of scour depth, cross-bedding variability and Chezy’s equation.</p>
					<p>The estimates indicate that the Middle Siwalik sequence corresponds to a system of rivers, whose individual channels were about 400 m wide and 5.2–7.3 m deep; the river on an average had a low sinuous channel and flowed over a depositional surface sloping at the rate of 53 cm/km. The 700-km long Middle Siwalik (Pliocene) river drained an area of 42925 km<sup>2</sup> to the north–northeast, with a flow velocity of 164–284 cm/s, as it flowed generally south–southwest of the Himalayan Orogen. Bed-load was about 15% of the total load of this river, whose annual discharge was about 346–1170 m<sup>3</sup>/s normally and rose to approximately 1854 m<sup>3</sup>/s during periodic floods. The Froude number of 0.22 suggests that the water flows in the Pliocene river channels were tranquil, which in turn account for the profuse development of cross-bedded units in the sandstone. The estimated paleochannel parameters, bedding characteristics and the abundance of coarse clastics in the lithic fill are rather similar to the modern braided rivers of Canada and India such as South Saskatchewan and Gomti, respectively.</p>

				<title>Fine-scale responses of phytoplankton to freshwater influx in a tropical monsoonal estuary following the onset of southwest monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0545-0556</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In May of 2007, a study was initiated by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, India, to investigate the influence of monsoonal rainfall on hydrographic conditions in the Mandovi River of India. The study was undertaken at a location ∼2 km upstream of the mouth of this estuary. During the premonsoon (PreM) in May, when circulation in the estuary was dominated by tidal activity, phytoplankton communities in the high saline (35–37 psu) waters at the study site were largely made up of the coastal neritic species <i>Fragilaria oceanica, Ditylum brightwellii</i> and <i>Trichodesmium erythraeum</i>. During the later part of the intermonsoon (InterM) phase, an abrupt decline in salinity led to a surge in phytoplankton biomass (Chlorophyll 𝑎 ∼14 mg m<sup>−3</sup>), of a population that was dominated by <i>Thalassiosira eccentricus</i>. As the southwest monsoon (SWM) progressed and the estuary freshened salinity and Chlorophyll 𝑎 (Chl 𝑎) concentrations decreased during the MoN, <i>Skeletonema costatum</i> established itself as the dominant form. Despite the low biomass (Chl 𝑎 &gt; 2 mg m<sup>−3</sup>), the phytoplankton community of the MoN was the most diverse of the entire study. During the postmonsoon (PostM), the increase in salinity was marked by a surge in dinoflagellate populations comprising of <i>Ceratium furca, Akashiwo sanguinea</i>, and <i>Pyrophacus horologium</i>.</p>

				<title>Modelling the response of an alluvial aquifer to anthropogenic and recharge stresses in the United States Southern Great Plains</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0557-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper uses Visual MODFLOW to simulate potential impacts of anthropogenic pumping and recharge variability on an alluvial aquifer in semi-arid northwestern Oklahoma. Groundwater withdrawal from the aquifer is projected to increase by more than 50% (relative to 1990) by the year 2050. In contrast, climate projections indicate declining regional precipitation over the next several decades, creating a potential problem of demand and supply. The following scenarios were simulated: (1) projected groundwater withdrawal, (2) a severe drought, (3) a prolonged wet period, and (4) a human adjustment scenario, which assumes future improvements in water conservation measures. Results indicate that the combined impacts of anthropogenic pumping and droughts would create drawdown of greater than 12 m in the aquifer. Spatially, however, areas of severe drawdown will be localized around large-capacity well clusters. The worst impacts of both pumping and droughts will be on stream–aquifer interaction. For example, the projected aquifer pumpage would lead to a total streamflow loss of 40%, creating losing stream system regionally. Similarly, a severe drought would lead to a total streamflow loss of &lt; 80%. A post-audit of the model was also carried out to evaluate model performance. By simulating various stress scenarios on the alluvial aquifer, this study provides important information for evaluating management options for alluvial aquifers.</p>

				<title>Determining the optimum cell size of digital elevation model for hydrologic application</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0573-0582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Scale is one of the most important but unsolved issues in various scientific disciplines that deal with spatial data. The arbitrary choice of grid cell size for contour interpolated digital elevation models (DEM) is one of the major sources of uncertainty in the hydrologic modelling process. In this paper, an attempt was made to identify methods for determining an optimum cell size for a contour interpolated DEM in prior to hydrologic modelling. Twenty-meter interval contour lines were used to generate DEMs of five different resolutions, <i>viz</i>., 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 m using TOPOGRID algorithm. The obtained DEMs were explored for their intrinsic quality using four different methods, i.e., sink analysis, fractal dimension of derived stream network, entropy measurement and semivariogram modelling. These methods were applied to determine the level artifacts (interpolation error) in DEM surface as well as derived stream network, spatial information content and spatial variability respectively. The results indicated that a 90 m cell size is sufficient to capture the terrain variability for subsequent hydrologic modelling in the study area. The significance of this research work is that it provides methods which DEM users can apply to select an appropriate DEM cell size in prior to detailed hydrologic modelling.</p>

				<title>Modelling spatial anisotropy of gold concentration data using GIS-based interpolated maps and variogram analysis: Implications for structural control of mineralization</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0583-0593</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linear trends of anomalously high gold values in the Florida Canyon gold deposit, Nevada have been identified using a combination of contour maps of gold (Au) concentration developed with a geographic information system (GIS) and variogram maps created using a geostatistical analysis package. These linear trends are interpreted to represent major fault zones that exerted a prinicipal control on gold mineralization and therefore imparted a spatial anisotropy to gold concentrations.</p>
					<p>Oxidation state information such as oxide, sulfide or mixed was used initially to map and contour the lower limit of the oxidation zone. Linear trends on this surface suggest the location and trend of major structural elements in the deposit that guided late oxidizing fluids. Subsequently, four contour maps of gold concentrations in oxidized rocks were produced, each map representing 500 ft vertical intervals starting at 3500 ft above mean sea level (msl). Relatively high concentrations of Au that form linear trends on these maps suggest the presence of structural features, such as shear zones that controlled mineralization. Finally, to validate the observed trends, variogram maps of gold concentrations were derived through geostatistical analysis and the major axes of anisotropy were determined for each map.</p>
					<p>The results that emerge suggest linear trends of northeast, northwest and, less prominently, north– south orientations. The north–south and northeast trends match those of known and mapped major structures associated with the Florida Canyon deposit. However, the results imply a stronger control on mineralization by northwest-trending structures than previously recognized and the location of possible structures of all trends not previously mapped. They also serve to identify faults that controlled both early hydrothermal fluids and late oxidizing fluids since the gold distribution represents the time integrated effects of both fluid events.</p>
					<p>The linear trends derived by spatial analysis (contour maps, variogram maps) of geochemical data (i.e., gold concentration), combined with the results of the field observations prove to be advantageous in understanding the structural control of gold mineralization. Such spatial analyses of geochemical concentration data are particularly useful in the field of mineral exploration.</p>

				<title>Efficient two-dimensional magnetotellurics modelling using implicitly restarted Lanczos method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0595-0604</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents an efficient algorithm, FDA2DMT (Free Decay Analysis for 2D Magnetotellurics (MT)), based on eigenmode approach to solve the relevant partial differential equation, for forward computation of two-dimensional (2D) responses. The main advantage of this approach lies in the fact that only a small subset of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are required for satisfactory results. This small subset (pre-specified number) of eigenmodes are obtained using shift and invert implementation of Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Method (IRLM). It has been established by experimentation that only 15–20% smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvectors are sufficient to secure the acceptable accuracy. Once the single frequency response is computed using eigenmode approach, the responses for subsequent frequencies can be obtained in negligible time. Experiment design results for validation of FDA2DMT are presented by considering two synthetic models from COMMEMI report, Brewitt-Taylor and Weaver (1976) model and a field data based model from Garhwal Himalaya.</p>

				<title>Development of the negative gravity anomaly of the 85&#176;E  Ridge, northeastern Indian Ocean – A process oriented modelling approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0605-0615</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 85&#176;E  Ridge extends from the Mahanadi Basin, off northeastern margin of India to the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the Central Indian Basin. The ridge is associated with two contrasting gravity anomalies: negative anomaly over the north part (up to 5&#176;N latitude), where the ridge structure is buried under thick Bengal Fan sediments and positive anomaly over the south part, where the structure is intermittently exposed above the seafloor. Ship-borne gravity and seismic reflection data are modelled using process oriented method and this suggest that the 85&#176;E  Ridge was emplaced on approximately 10–15 km thick elastic plate (<i>Te</i>) and in an off-ridge tectonic setting. We simulated gravity anomalies for different crust-sediment structural configurations of the ridge that were existing at three geological ages, such as Late Cretaceous, Early Miocene and Present. The study shows that the gravity anomaly of the ridge in the north has changed through time from its inception to present. During the Late Cretaceous the ridge was associated with a significant positive anomaly with a compensation generated by a broad flexure of the Moho boundary. By Early Miocene the ridge was approximately covered by the postcollision sediments and led to alteration of the initial gravity anomaly to a small positive anomaly. At present, the ridge is buried by approximately 3 km thick Bengal Fan sediments on its crestal region and about 8 km thick pre- and post-collision sediments on the flanks. This geological setting had changed physical properties of the sediments and led to alter the minor positive gravity anomaly of Early Miocene to the distinct negative gravity anomaly.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The study involves the characterization of pegmatoidal granite, southeast of Beawar, Ajmer district, Rajasthan. Earlier researchers had described this granite as part of the BGC, basement to the Bhim Group of the Delhi Super Group rocks. However, the present study indicates that it is younger than the rocks of Bhim Group of South Delhi Fold Belt, into which it is intrusive. The intrusion is structurally controlled and the outcrop pattern is phacolithic. The granite had intruded post-D<sub>2</sub> deformation of the Delhi orogeny along the axial planes of D<sub>2</sub> folds. The intrusion has also resulted in the formation of a contact aureole about the calc gneisses.</p>

				<title>Mafic rocks from Erinpura gneiss terrane in the Sirohi region: Possible ocean-floor remnants in the foreland of the Delhi Fold Belt, NW India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0627-0641</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A small isolated mafic body occurs to the south of Sirohi near village Daba within the Neoproterozoic Erinpura Granite in the southern sector of the Proterozoic Delhi Fold Belt in NW India. This mafic body occurs close to a 100 m wide NE–SW trending shear zone (Daba Shear Zone) which overprints the felsic rock fabrics. Further south, a small mafic body near village Kui was also sampled which forms the southern limit of the Phulad Ophiolite Suite which is a 300 km long major NE–SW trending lineament, described as Western Margin Fault. Some of the lithological components of the Daba mafic body show locally preserved magmatic fabric but completely transformed mineralogies under lower amphibolites facies metamorphic conditions where two-stage deformation has been inferred. Magnetic fabric analysis underlines a general correspondence of structural elements in both felsic and mafic lithologies. Binary correlations of Zr with other high field strength elements underline fractionation as the main process in the evolution of Daba and Kui rocks. Geochemical characteristics indicate subalkaline tholeiitic basalt affinity for these mafic rocks. The trace element characteristics, such as enriched LIL elements, high Th, absence of negative Nb anomalies and depletion in compatible elements in Daba samples suggest an enriched mantle source and lower degree of melting. The trace and rare earth element characteristics for Kui (Th anomaly, Nb–Ta trough and less spiked patterns, flat REE trends) indicate derivation from a refractory mantle source affected by fluids derived from subduction. Distinct differences in trace and REE characteristics between Daba and Kui can be interpreted in terms of different stages of ophiolite development.</p>

				<title>Pb–Pb zircon ages of Archaean metasediments and gneisses from the Dharwar craton, southern India: Implications for the antiquity of the eastern Dharwar craton</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0643-0661</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>$^{207}Pb–^{206}Pb$ ages of zircons in samples of metasediments as well as ortho- and para-gneisses from both the western and the eastern parts of the Dharwar craton have been determined using an ion microprobe. Detrital zircons in metasedimentary rocks from both yielded ages ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 Ga. Zircons from orthogneisses from the two parts also yielded similar ages. Imprints of younger events have been discerned in the ages of overgrowths on older zircon cores in samples collected throughout the craton. Our data show that the evolution of the southwestern part of eastern Dharwar craton involved a significant amount of older crust (&lt; 3.0 Ga). This would suggest that crust formation in both the western and eastern parts of the Dharwar craton took place over similar time interval starting in the Mesoarchaean at ca. 3.5 Ga and continuing until 2.5 Ga. Our data coupled with geological features and geodynamic setting of the Dharwar craton tend to suggest that the eastern Dharwar craton and the western Dharwar craton formed part of a single terrane.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0681-0701</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to reconstruct the palaeoclimate, a number of fossil wood pieces were collected and investigated from two new fossil localities situated in the Dhemaji and Lakhimpur districts of Assam. They belong to the Tipam Group considered to be of Middle–Late Miocene in age and show affinities with <i>Gluta</i> (Anacardiaceae), <i>Bischofia</i> (Euphorbiaceae), <i>Bauhinia, Cynometra, Copaifera-Detarium-Sindora, Millettia-Pongamia</i>, and <i>Afzelia-Intsia</i> (Fabaceae). The flora also records a new species of <i>Bauhinia</i> named <i>Bauhinia miocenica</i> sp. nov. The assemblage indicates a warm and humid climate in the region during the deposition of the sediments. The occurrence of some southeast Asian elements in the fossil flora indicates that an exchange of floral elements took place between India and southeast Asia during the Miocene.</p>

				<title>Carbon isotopic composition of fossil leaves from the Early Cretaceous sediments of western  India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0703-0711</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stable carbon isotope analysis of fossil leaves from the Bhuj Formation, western India was carried out to infer the prevailing environmental conditions. Compression fossil leaves such as <i>Pachypteris indica, Otozamite kachchhensis, Brachyphyllum royii</i> and <i>Dictyozamites</i> sp. were recovered from three sedimentary successions of the Bhuj Formation, Early Cretaceous in age. A chronology was established based on faunal assemblage and palyno-stratigraphy and further constrained by carbon isotope stratigraphy. The three sampling sites were the Karawadi river bank near Dharesi; the Chawad river bank near Mathal; and the Pur river section near Trambau village in Gujarat. The Dharesi sample was also analyzed to investigate intra-leaf 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C variability. The mean 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C of the leaf was $−24.6$ ± 0.4‰ which implied negligible systematic change along the leaf axis. The Mathal sample was fragmented in nature and showed considerable variation in carbon isotopic composition. The Trambau sample considered to be the oldest, dating to the middle of Aptian (<i>ca</i>. 116 Ma), shows the most depleted value in 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C among all of them. The overall 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C trend ranging from mid Aptian (<i>ca</i>. 116 Ma) to early Albian (<i>ca</i>. 110 Ma) shows a progressive increase in 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C from −26.8 to −20.5‰. Based on these measurements the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide of the Aptian–Albian period is estimated to be between −7.4 and −1.7‰. The ratio of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in leaf to that of the ambient atmosphere calculated based on a model is estimated to be similar to that of the modern plants. This indicates that the Early-Cretaceous plants adapted to the prevailing high carbon dioxide regime by increasing their photosynthetic uptake.</p>

				<title>Tree-ring variation in teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i> L.) from Allapalli, Maharashtra in relation to moisture and Palmer Drought Severity Index, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0713-0721</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We developed a ring-width chronology of teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i> L.) from a moisture stressed area in Maharashtra, India. Bootstrapped correlation analysis indicated that moisture index (MI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) showed better performance rather than same year rainfall over the region. Tree-ring variations were most correlated positively with PDSI during different seasons compared with MI. Significant strong positive correlation with MI, and negative association with temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were found during previous and current year post-monsoon (ON). This study shows that the moisture availability during the post-monsoon of the previous year has a significant role in the development of annual growth rings. The reconstructed previous year post-monsoon (−ON) moisture index for the period 1866–1996 indicates 3.5 and 29.3 years periodicities.</p>

				<title>Discontinuity surfaces and event stratigraphy of Okha Shell Limestone Member: Implications for Holocene sea level changes, western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0723-0734</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Okha Shell Limestone Member of Chaya Formation is the coarse grained, shell rich deposit commonly recognized as the beach rocks. It has been age bracketed between Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Late Quaternary sea level changes have been studied with beach rocks along the Saurashtra coastal region. The present study has been carried out in the Okhamandal area of the Saurashtra peninsula especially on the Okha Shell Limestone Member as exposed at various locations along the coast from north to south. Temporal and spatial correlations of the observations have revealed three events in the Okha Shell Limestone Member of Chaya Formation that are correlated laterally. The events show depositional breaks represented by discontinuity surfaces, the taphofacies varieties and ichnological variations. The present study in the context of available geochrnological data of the region suggests a prominent depositional break representing low sea level stand (regression) during an Early Holocene during the deposition of Okha Shell Limestone Member.</p>

				<title>The ion–aerosol interactions from the ion mobility and aerosol particle size distribution measurements on January 17 and February 18, 2005 at Maitri, Antarctica – A case study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0735-0754</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A case study for the ion–aerosol interactions is presented from the simultaneous measurements of mobility spectra of atmospheric ions in the mobility range of 2.29 to 2.98 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (diameter range 0.41–109 nm) and of size distribution of atmospheric aerosol particles in the size ranges of 4.4–700 nm and 500–20,000 nm diameters made at Maitri (70&#176; 45&#8242; 52&#8242;&#8242;S, 11&#176; 44&#8242; 2.7&#8242;&#8242;E; 130 m above mean sea level), Antarctica, on two days January 17 and February 18, 2005, with contrasting meteorological conditions. In contrast to January 17, on February 18, winds were stronger from the morning to noon and lower from the noon to evening, atmospheric pressure was lower, cloudiness was more, the land surface remained snow-covered after a blizzard on February 16 and 17 and the airmass over Maitri, descended from an altitude of ∼3 km after an excursion over ocean. On these days mobility spectra showed two modes, corresponding to intermediate ions and light large ions and an indication of additional one/two maxima for small/cluster ions and heavy large ions. The small ions generated by cosmic rays, and the nucleation mode particles generated probably by photochemical reactions grew in size by condensation of volatile trace gases on them and produced the cluster and intermediate ion modes and the Aitken particle mode in ion/particle spectra. Particles in the size range of 9–26 nm have been estimated to grow at the rate of 1.9 nm h<sup>−1</sup> on February 18, 2005. Both, ions and aerosol particles show bimodal size distributions in the 16–107 nm size range, and comparison of the two size distributions suggests the formation of multiple charged ions. Attachment of small ions to particles in this bimodal distribution of Aitken particles together with the formation of multiple charged ions are proposed to result in the light and heavy large ion modes. Growth of the nucleation mode particles on February 18, 2005 is associated with the passage of the airmass over ocean. In contrast, though the ion size distributions were not much different, the aerosol size distributions did not show a dominant peak for the formation and growth of nucleation mode particles on January 17. More measurements are needed before the conclusion of this case study is generalized.</p>

				<title>Analysis on MM5 predictions at Sriharikota during northeast monsoon 2008</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0755-0771</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian northeast monsoon is inherently chaotic in nature as the rainfall realised in the peninsular India depends substantially on the formation and movement of low-pressure systems in central and southwest Bay of Bengal and on the convective activity which is mainly due to the moist north-easterlies from Bay of Bengal. The objective of this study is to analyse the performance of the PSU-NCAR Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5), for northeast monsoon 2008 that includes tropical cyclones – Rashmi, Khai-Muk and Nisha and convective events over Sriharikota region, the rocket launch centre. The impact of objective analysis system using radiosonde observations, surface observations and Kalpana-1 satellite derived Atmospheric Motion Wind Vectors (AMV) is also studied. The performance of the model is analysed by comparing the predicted parameters like mean sea level pressure (MSLP), intensity, track and rainfall with the observations. The results show that the model simulations could capture MSLP and intensity of all the cyclones reasonably well. The dependence of the movement of the system on the environmental flow is clearly observed in all the three cases. The vector displacement error and percentage of improvement is calculated to study the impact of objective data analysis on the movement and intensity of the cyclone.</p>

				<title>Meso-scale atmospheric events promote phytoplankton blooms in the coastal Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0773-0782</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Bay of Bengal is considered to be a low productive region compared to the Arabian Sea based on conventional seasonal observations. Such seasonal observations are not representative of a calendar year since the conventional approach might miss episodic high productive events associated with extreme atmospheric processes. We examined here the influence of extreme atmospheric events, such as heavy rainfall and cyclone <i>Sidr</i>, on phytoplankton biomass in the western Bay of Bengal using both <i>in situ</i> time-series observations and satellite derived Chlorophyll 𝑎 (Chl 𝑎) and sea surface temperature (SST). Supply of nutrients through the runoff driven by episodic heavy rainfall (234 mm) on 4–5 October 2007 caused an increase in Chl 𝑎 concentration by four times than the previous in the coastal Bay was observed within two weeks. Similar increase in Chl 𝑎, by 3 to 10 times, was observed on the right side of the cyclone <i>Sidr</i> track in the central Bay of Bengal after the cyclone <i>Sidr</i>. These two episodic events caused phytoplankton blooms in the western Bay of Bengal which enhanced ∼40% of fishery production during October–December 2007 compared to that in the same period in 2006.</p>

				<title>Anomalous behaviour of the Indian summer monsoon 2009</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0783-0794</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Indian subcontinent witnessed a severe monsoon drought in the year 2009. India as a whole received 77% of its long period average during summer monsoon season (1 June to 30 September) of 2009, which is the third highest deficient all India monsoon season rainfall year during the period 1901–2009. Therefore, an attempt is made in this paper to study the characteristic features of summer monsoon rainfall of 2009 over the country and to investigate some of the possible causes behind the anomalous behaviour of the monsoon.</p>
					<p>Presence of El Niño like conditions in the Pacific and warming over the equatorial Indian Ocean altered the circulation patterns and produced an anomalous low level convergence and ascending motion over the Indian Ocean region and large scale subsidence over the Indian landmass. Furthermore, the crossequatorial flow was weak, the monsoon was dominated by the slower 30–60 day mode, and the synoptic systems, which formed over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, did not move inland. All the above features resulted in less moisture supply over the Indian landmass, resulting in subdued rainfall activity leading to a severe monsoon drought during 2009.</p>

				<title>Multi-model ensemble schemes for predicting northeast monsoon rainfall over peninsular India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0795-0805</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The northeast (NE) monsoon season (October, November and December) is the major period of rainfall activity over south peninsular India. This study is mainly focused on the prediction of northeast monsoon rainfall using lead-1 products (forecasts for the season issued in beginning of September) of seven general circulation models (GCMs). An examination of the performances of these GCMs during hindcast runs (1982–2008) indicates that these models are not able to simulate the observed interannual variability of rainfall. Inaccurate response of the models to sea surface temperatures may be one of the probable reasons for the poor performance of these models to predict seasonal mean rainfall anomalies over the study domain. An attempt has been made to improve the accuracy of predicted rainfall using three different multi-model ensemble (MME) schemes, <i>viz</i>., simple arithmetic mean of models (EM), principal component regression (PCR) and singular value decomposition based multiple linear regressions (SVD). It is found out that among these three schemes, SVD based MME has more skill than other MME schemes as well as member models.</p>

				<title>Long-term variations in outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR), convective available potential energy (CAPE) and temperature in the tropopause region over India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0807-0823</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Relationship of outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) with convective available potential energy (CAPE) and temperature at the 100-hPa pressure level is examined using daily radiosonde data for a period 1980–2006 over Delhi (28.3&#176; N, 77.1&#176;E) and Kolkata (22.3&#176;N, 88.2&#176;E), and during 1989–2005 over Cochin (10&#176;N, 77&#176;E) and Trivandrum (8.5&#176;N, 77.0&#176;E), India. Correlation coefficient ($R_xy$) between monthly OLR and CAPE shows a significant (∼ −0.45) anti-correlation at Delhi and Kolkata suggesting low OLR associated with high convective activity during summer (seasonal variation). Though, no significant correlation was found between OLR and CAPE at Cochin and Trivandrum (low latitude region); analysis of OLR and temperature (at 100-hPa) association suggests that low OLR peaks appear corresponding to low temperature at Delhi ($R_xy$ ∼0.30) and Kolkata ($R_xy$ ∼0.25) during summer. However, $R_xy$ between OLR and temperature becomes opposite as we move towards low latitudes (∼8&#176; $–$10&#176;N) due to strong solar cycle influence. Large scale components mainly ENSO and quasi-biennial oscillaton (QBO) that contributed to the 100-hPa temperature variability were also analyzed, which showed that ENSO variance is larger by a factor of two in comparison to QBO over Indian region. ENSO warm conditions cause warming at 100-hPa over Delhi and Darwin. However, due to strong QBO and solar signals in the equatorial region, ENSO signal seems less effective. QBO, ENSO, and solar cycle contribution in temperature are found location-dependent (latitudinal variability) responding in consonance with shifting in convective activity regime during El Niño, seasonal variability in the tropical easterly jet, and the solar irradiance.</p>

				<title>Study of vertical wind profiles in an urban area with complex terrain (Tehran)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0825-0841</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper monthly trends of vertical wind profiles within and above an urban area with complex topography (Tehran) have been investigated using data from a Sodar, a 100-m and two 28-m towers and some surface stations. It includes the occurrence, evolution, dissipation time, peak time and maximum height for katabatic–anabatic winds due to topography, return flow and urban circulation. Vertical distributions of wind and the heat and momentum fluxes up to 600 m were also considered.</p>
					<p>The vertical wind profiles which have diurnal and seasonal variations show southwesterly daily anabatic wind and northeasterly nocturnal katabatic wind. Daily vertical wind profile structure which has two layers and two jets contains a decrease approximately at 300–400 m which may be due to the return flow and a daily thermal convective flow in the urban convergent terrain. At night the nocturnal wind profile structure, in the majority of months, has two layers and sometimes three layers containing northeasterly flows. In two layers structure, a decrease can be seen between two layers. In three layers structure, the middle layer has a different direction that indicates the return flow and urban circulation more clearly. Katabatic flows also develop in successive phases varying from 1 to 3 phases in different months. Investigation on surface wind demonstrates that in cold months a drainage flow from a valley located in the west of the station can affect wind speed and direction especially at evening transition time. These flow patterns can influence the way air pollutants disperse in this area.</p>

				<title>New particle formation by ion-induced nucleation during dissipation stage of thunderstorm</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0843-0850</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A case of new particle formation observed during dissipation stage of a thunderstorm at a tropical station, Pune, India on 3 June 2008 is reported. The flash rate and rainfall intensity increased as high as 110 flashes per 5 minutes and 150 mm hour<sup>−1</sup> respectively during the active stage of thunderstorm, and then gradually decreased during the dissipation stage. The number concentration of particles in the size range of 10–100 nm sharply increased from 350 particles cm<sup>-3</sup> to ∼8000 particles cm<sup>-3</sup> during the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm and grew to larger diameter subsequently. Observations suggest that the atmospheric conditions such as (i) reduced background aerosol concentration after heavy rain, (ii) high humidity condition, and (iii) increased ion concentration during the dissipation stage by corona discharges, favoured generation of new particles by ion-induced nucleation (IIN). Observations also suggest that generation of unipolar ions by corona discharges may be more favourable for IIN and subsequent growth of the particles.</p>

				<title>GPS based TEC measurements for a period August 2008–December 2009 near the northern crest of Indian equatorial ionospheric anomaly region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0851-0858</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent years, measurements of total electron content (TEC) have gained importance with increasing demand for the GPS-based navigation applications in trans-ionospheric communications. To study the variation in ionospheric TEC, we used the data obtained from GPS Ionospheric Scintillation and TEC monitoring (GISTM) system which is in operation at SVNIT, Surat, India (21.16&#176;N, 72.78&#176;E) located at the northern crest of equatorial anomaly region. The data collected (for the low sunspot activity period from August 2008–December 2009) were used to study the diurnal, monthly, seasonal semi-annual and annual variations of TEC at Surat. It was observed that the diurnal variation at the region reaches its maximum value between 13:00 and 16:00 IST. The monthly average diurnal variations showed that the TEC maximizes during the equinox months followed by the winter months, and are lowest during the summer months. The ionospheric range delay to TEC for the primary GPS signal is 0.162 m per TECU. The diurnal variation in TEC shows a minimum to maximum variation of about 5 to 50 TECU (in current low sunspot activity periods). These TEC values correspond to range delay variations of about 1 to 9 m at Surat. These variations in the range delay will certainly increase in high sunspot activity periods. Detected TEC variations are also closely related to space weather characterizing quantities such as solar wind and geomagnetic activity indices.</p>

				<title>Impact of Ganges–Brahmaputra interannual discharge variations on Bay of Bengal salinity and temperature during 1992–1999 period</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0859-0872</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigates the impact of monthly Ganges–Brahmaputra river discharge variations on  Bay of Bengal salinity and temperature during the period 1992–1999. The Ganges–Brahmaputra river discharge is characterized by a well-defined seasonal cycle with strong interannual variations. The highest/lowest yearly peak discharge occurs in summer 1998/summer 1992, with 1998 value amounting to twice that of 1992. This river discharge is then used to force an ocean general circulation model. Our main result is that the impact of these rivers on the variability of Bay of Bengal sea surface salinity is strong in the northern part, with excess run-off forcing fresh anomalies, and <i>vice versa</i>. Most of the years, the influence of the interannual variability of river discharge on the Bay salinity does not extend south of ∼10&#176; N. This stands in contrast with the available observations and is probably linked to the relatively coarse resolution of our model. However, the extreme discharge anomaly of 1998 is exported through the southern boundary of the Bay and penetrates the south-eastern Arabian Sea a few months after the discharge peak. In response to the discharge anomalies, the model simulates significant mixed-layer temperature anomalies in the northern Bay of Bengal. This has the potential to influence the climate of the area. From our conclusions, it appears necessary to use a numerical model with higher resolution (both on the horizontal and vertical) to quantitatively investigate the upper Bay of Bengal salinity structure.</p>

				<title>Subsurface signatures and timing of extreme wave events along the southeast Indian coast</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0873-0883</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Written history’s limitation becomes apparent when attempting to document the predecessors of extreme coastal events in the Indian Ocean, from 550–700 years in Thailand and 1000 years in Indonesia. Detailed ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys in Mahabalipuram, southeast India, complemented with sedimentological analyses, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and optical dating provide strong evidence of extreme wave events during the past 3700 years. The diagnostic event signatures include the extent and elevation of the deposits, as well as morphologic similarity of buried erosional scarps to those reported in northern Sumatra region. Optical ages immediately overlying the imaged discontinuities that coincides with high concentration of heavy minerals date the erosional events to 340 ± 35, 350 ± 20, 490 ± 30, 880 ± 40, 1080 ± 60, 1175 ± 188, 2193 ± 266, 2235 ± 881, 2489 ± 293, 2450 ± 130, 2585 ± 609, 3710 ± 200 years ago. These evidences are crucial in reconstructing paleo extreme wave events and will pave the way for regional correlation of erosional horizons along the northern margin of Indian Ocean.</p>

				<title>Environmental magnetic and geochemical characteristics of Chennai coastal sediments, Bay of Bengal, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0885-0895</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, environmental magnetic, heavy metal and statistical analyses were conducted on 21 surface sediments collected from Chennai coast, India, to examine the feasibility of heavy metal pollution using magnetic susceptibility. The Chennai coastal sediment samples are dominated by ferrimagnetic minerals corresponding to magnetite-like minerals. The percentage of frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility reflects the presence of super-paramagnetic/single domain magnetic minerals in Chennai harbour, Cooum and Adayar rivers sediments. High pollution load index in sample E1, E2, CH7, C11, C12 and A16 is mainly due to anthropogenic activities such as, harbour activities, Cooum and Adayar rivers input and industrial effluent. Factor analysis shows that the magnetic concentration dependent parameters ($\chi , \chi_{ARM}$ and SIRM) covary with the heavy metal concentrations, suggesting that the input of magnetic minerals and heavy metals in Chennai coastal sediments are derived from the same anthropogenic sources. Strong correlation obtained between pollution load index (PLI) and concentration dependent parameters ($\chi , \chi_{ARM}$ and SIRM) for the polluted samples with magnetic susceptibility excess of 50 &#215; 10<sup>−8</sup> m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>−1</sup>. Significant correlations between heavy metals and magnetic susceptibility point out the potential of magnetic screening/monitoring for simple and rapid proxy indicator of heavy metal pollution in marine sediments.</p>

The samples collected were analysed for major cations, anions and trace elements by using standard procedures. The study reveals that pH has a significant role in the saturation index (SI) of minerals. It also shows that the relationship of electrical conductivity to the SI of these minerals is not significant than that of the ionic strength, log pCO<sub>2</sub> values, and alumina silica ratio have significant relation to the SI of these clay minerals. The SI of these clay minerals was spatially distributed to identify the areas of higher SI. Silica has good correlation to SI of Kaolinite, Gibbsite and Montmorillonite and Al has good correlation to SI of all the minerals except to that of Chlorite.</p>

				<title>Spatial and temporal variation of uranium in a shallow weathered rock aquifer in southern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0911-0920</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Uranium occurs naturally in groundwater and surface water. The objective of this study is to understand the causes for the occurrence of uranium and its spatio-temporal variation in groundwater in a part of Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh, south India. Uranium deposits occur in the southeastern part of this area. Groundwater samples were collected from 44 wells every two months from March 2008 to January 2009. The samples were analyzed for pH, ORP and uranium concentration. The uranium concentration in groundwater varies from 0.2 ppb to a maximum of 68 ppb with a mean of 18.5 ppb. About 21.6% of the samples were above the drinking water limit of 30 ppb set by USEPA. The uranium concentration varied with fluctuation in groundwater level, pH and ORP. Uranium concentration in groundwater changes depending on lithology, degree of weathering and rainfall recharge.</p>

				<title>Geochemical characterization of surface water and spring water in SE Kashmir Valley, western Himalaya: Implications to water–rock interaction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0921-0932</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Water samples from precipitation, glacier melt, snow melt, glacial lake, streams and karst springs were collected across SE of Kashmir Valley, to understand the hydrogeochemical processes governing the evolution of the water in a natural and non-industrial area of western Himalayas. The time series data on solute chemistry suggest that the hydrochemical processes controlling the chemistry of spring waters is more complex than the surface water. This is attributed to more time available for infiltrating water to interact with the diverse host lithology. Total dissolved solids (TDS), in general, increases with decrease in altitude. However, high TDS of some streams at higher altitudes and low TDS of some springs at lower altitudes indicated contribution of high TDS waters from glacial lakes and low TDS waters from streams, respectively. The results show that some karst springs are recharged by surface water; Achabalnag by the Bringi stream and Andernag and Martandnag by the Liddar stream. Calcite dissolution, dedolomitization and silicate weathering were found to be the main processes controlling the chemistry of the spring waters and calcite dissolution as the dominant process in controlling the chemistry of the surface waters. The spring waters were undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite in most of the seasons except in November, which is attributed to the replenishment of the CO<sub>2</sub> by recharging waters during most of the seasons.</p>

				<title>Palynofacies characterization for hydrocarbon source rock evaluation in the Subathu Formation of Marhighat, Sirmaur district, Himachal Pradesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0933-0938</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deals with the hydrocarbon source rock evaluation of the Subathu Formation exposed at Marhighat on Sarahan–Narag road in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh. Hydrocarbon potential of these sediments is estimated on the basis of palynofacies analysis and thermal alteration index (TAI) values based on the fossil spores/pollen colouration. The analyses are based on the classification and hydrocarbon generation potential of plant derived dispersed organic matter present in the sediments. The palynofacies analysis of Subathu Formation in the area reveal moderate to rich organic matter, with amorphous organic matter constituting the bulk of the total organic matter, followed by charcoal, biodegraded organic matter, fungal remains, spores/pollen and structured terrestrial organic matter. The TAI value for the organic matter in these sediments has been ascertained as 3.00. A dominance of the sapropelic facies (amorphous organic matter) and the measured TAI values for the Subathu sediments in the Marhighat area suggests a good source-rock potential for the hydrocarbon generation.</p>

				<title>Kink bands in thrust regime: Examples from Srinagar—Garhwal area, Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0939-0948</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper deciphers the late stress systems involved in the development of kink bands in the perspective of thrust regime. In kink bands, the correlation coefficient for 𝛼-𝛽 plots is positive near thrusts and negative away from thrusts. The plots show nearly linear relationship near thrusts and non-linear relationship away from thrusts. The rotation was prominent mechanism of kink band formation near thrusts and rotation coupled with shearing, along the kink planes away from thrusts. Along thrusts 𝜎<sub>1</sub> is horizontal E–W trend and it rotates to horizontal N–S trend away from the thrust. The proposed model establishes that (1) the shearing along kink planes led to angular relationship, 𝛽 &gt; 𝛼 and (2) the kink planes of conjugate kinks could be used for paleostress analysis even in those cases where shearing along these planes has occurred.</p>

				<title>A decision support system-based procedure for evaluation and monitoring of protected areas sustainability for the Mediterranean region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0949-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Despite common acknowledgement of the value of protected areas as instruments in ensuring sustainability, and their promotion for the achievement of policies on halting the loss of biodiversity, there is no common approach today for monitoring and evaluating them. This paper presents a novel integrated nature conservation management procedure developed to monitor and evaluate the sustainability of Mediterranean protected areas. This procedure was successfully implemented and formally evaluated by protected area managers in six  Mediterranean countries, results of which are presented here together with an overview of the web-based Decision Support System (DSS) developed to facilitate its wide adoption. The DSS and procedure has been designed and evaluated by managers as a useful tool, which facilitates and provides needed procedural guidance for protected area monitoring whilst minimizing input requirements to do so. The procedure and DSS were developed following a review of existing protected area assessment tools and a detailed primary investigation of the needs and capacity of its intended users. Essentially, the procedure and DSS guides provide the facilities for protected area managers, in following a participatory approach to develop a context-specific sustainability monitoring strategy, for their protected area. Consequently, the procedure is, by design, participatory, context specific, holistic and relevant to protected area management and institutional procedures. The procedure was piloted and formally evaluated in Greece, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Malta and Cyprus. Feedback collected from the pilot evaluations is also summarised herein.</p>

				<title>Numerical study of mechanism of fold formation in a laminated rock</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0965-0978</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A set of large deformation experiments are presented to simulate folding pattern at various energy states during formation. In order to numerically simulate this phenomenon, a rectangular layer of shale is generated and compressed at various strain rates. The results reveal the variation in distribution of stress along the length of the bed. The stress distribution during elastic behaviour of shale bed at low compression rate and the change in stress distribution leading to rupture at high compression rates is discussed. Wavelength, limb length, bulk shortening, stress distribution, displacement of particles along the length of the bed is considered for comparative study of the fold pattern generated at various compression rates. The nature and position of crack generated during the formation of fold is also explained. After rupture in shale bed, the generation of fault and stress distribution in limbs of fold sliding over one another is also described.</p>

				<title>Lithostratigraphic development and neotectonic significance of the Quaternary sediments along the Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF) zone, western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0979-0999</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF) is a major E–W trending seismically active fault of the Kachchh palaeorift basin whose neotectonic evolution is not known. The present study deals with the eastern part of the KMF zone where the fault is morphologically expressed as steep north facing scarps and is divisible into five morphotectonic segments. The Quaternary sediments occurring in a narrow zone between the E–W trending KMF scarps and the flat Banni plain to the north are documented. The sediments show considerable heterogeneity vertically as well as laterally along the KMF zone. (The Quaternary sediments for a northward sloping and are exposed along the north flowing streams which also show rapid decrease in the depth of incision in the same direction.) The deposits, in general, comprise coarse as well as finer gravelly deposits, sands and aeolian and fluvial miliolites. The Quaternary sediments of the KMF zone show three major aggradation phases. The oldest phase includes the colluvio-fluvial sediments occurring below the miliolites. These deposits are strikingly coarse grained and show poor sorting and large angular clasts of Mesozoic rocks. The sedimentary characteristics indicate deposition, dominantly by debris flows and sediment gravity flows, as small coalescing alluvial fans in front of the scarps. These deposits suggest pre-miliolite neotectonic activity along the KMF. The second aggradation phase comprises aeolian miliolites and fluvially reworked miliolites that have been previously dated from middle to late Pleistocene. The youngest phase is the post-miliolite phase that includes all deposits younger than miliolite. These are represented by comparatively finer sandy gravels, gravelly sands and sand. The sediment characteristics suggest deposition in shallow braided stream channels under reduced level of neotectonic activity along the KMF during post-miliolite time evidenced by vertical dips of miliolites and tilting of gravels near the scarps. The tectonically controlled incision and dissection of the Quaternary deposits is the result of neotectonic activity that continues at present day. The overall nature, sedimentary characteristics and geomorphic setting of the sediments suggest that the KMF remained neotectonically active throughout the Quaternary period.</p>

				<title>Nonlinear genetic-based simulation of soil shear strength parameters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1001-1022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New nonlinear solutions were developed to estimate the soil shear strength parameters utilizing linear genetic programming (LGP). The soil cohesion intercept (𝑐) and angle of shearing resistance (𝜙) were formulated in terms of the basic soil physical properties. The best models were selected after developing and controlling several models with different combinations of influencing parameters. Comprehensive experimental database used for developing the models was established upon a series of unconsolidated, undrained, and unsaturated triaxial tests conducted in this study. Further, sensitivity and parametric analyses were carried out. 𝑐 and 𝜙 were found to be mostly influenced by the soil unit weight and liquid limit. In order to benchmark the proposed models, a multiple least squares regression (MLSR) analysis was performed. The validity of the models was proved on portions of laboratory results that were not included in the modelling process. The developed models are able to effectively learn the complex relationship between the soil strength parameters and their contributing factors. The LGP models provide a significantly better prediction performance than the regression models.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present topography of the Făgăraş Mountains is a snapshot of the long-term evolution that brought about significant alterations of the landscape, and especially of the relief, which has acquired different features depending on the intensity of the relationship between the exogenous and endogenous agents. At present, relief shaping in the study area is controlled by the orographic and climatic features. However, the climate of the high and middle-height mountains is the main cause that determines the mechanism, the intensity and the spatial distribution of the shaping processes. The considerable height of the Făgăraş Mountains, which exceeds 2500 m altitude is responsible for the vertical zonation of climate and vegetation which implicitly induce the setting of the systems of relief modelling, too.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mawpyut igneous suite in Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya plateau comprises differentiated suite of ultramafic–mafic rocks. The complex differs from other ultramafic–alkaline–carbonatite igneous emplacements of Shillong plateau and Mikir Hills like Jesra, Sung, Samchampi complexes, by the absence of alkaline–carbonatite rocks as major litho-units. Melanite garnet-bearing nepheline syenite, occurs as late phase minor intrusion in Mawpyut igneous complex, posseses alkaline character and shows inubiquitous relation with the host ultramafic–mafic rocks. On the other hand, this alkaline intrusive bodies of the Mawpyut igneous complex shows chemico-mineralogical resemblance with garnet-bearing nepheline syenite, ijolite litho-members of Jesra, Sung, Samchampi complexes of the region. It is interpreted that melanite garnet-bearing nepheline syenite intrusion in Mawpyut is contemporaneous with Jesra, Sung, Samchampi ultramafic–alkaline–carbonatite complexes and the host rocks of Mawpyut complex is an earlier magmatic activity possibly from a comparatively least enriched source.</p>

				<title>Anthropogenic and impact spherules: Morphological similarity and chemical distinction – A case study from India and its implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1043-1054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper provides first report of silica-rich anthropogenic spherules of varying colour, shape, size, surface texture and chemical composition found in road-deposited sediments (RDS) of Allahabad city, Uttar Pradesh, India. Morphological details and lithophile elemental composition of the silica-rich spherules are compared to microtektites and impact spherules from India to demonstrate their striking morphological similarities and chemical variability. This study suggests the need to use spherule data carefully while assigning an impact origin to spherule-finds or spherule-bearing lithological horizons.</p>

				<title>A generalized solution for groundwater head fluctuation in a tidal leaky aquifer system</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1055-1066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new analytical solution is developed for describing groundwater level fluctuations in a coupled leaky confined aquifer system which consists of an unconfined aquifer, confined aquifer, and an aquitard in between. The aquifer system has a tidal boundary at the seashore, a no flow boundary at remote inland side, and a confined aquifer extending under the sea and terminated with an outlet-capping. This new solution has shown to be a generalisation of most existing analytical solutions for a tidal aquifer system which includes single confined and leaky confined aquifers. In addition, the solution is used to explore the influences of the dimensionless leakance of the outlet-capping, the dimensionless hydraulic diffusivities, and the leakages of the inland and offshore aquitards on the head responses in the leaky confined aquifer.</p>

				<title>Intermittent reservoir daily-inflow prediction using lumped and distributed data multi-linear regression models</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1067-1084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, multi-linear regression (MLR) approach is used to construct intermittent reservoir daily inflow forecasting system. To illustrate the applicability and effect of using lumped and distributed input data in MLR approach, Koyna river watershed in Maharashtra, India is chosen as a case study. The results are also compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. MLR attempts to model the relationship between two or more independent variables over a dependent variable by fitting a linear regression equation. The main aim of the present study is to see the consequences of development and applicability of simple models, when sufficient data length is available. Out of 47 years of daily historical rainfall and reservoir inflow data, 33 years of data is used for building the model and 14 years of data is used for validating the model. Based on the observed daily rainfall and reservoir inflow, various types of time-series, cause-effect and combined models are developed using lumped and distributed input data. Model performance was evaluated using various performance criteria and it was found that as in the present case, of well correlated input data, both lumped and distributed MLR models perform equally well. For the present case study considered, both MLR and ARIMA models performed equally sound due to availability of large dataset.</p>

				<title>A comparative study on isotopic composition of precipitation in wet tropic and semi-arid stations across southern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1085-1094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Isotopic composition of monthly composite precipitation samples from Kozhikode (𝑛 = 31), a wet tropic station and Hyderabad (𝑛 = 25), a semi-arid station across southern India were studied for a period of four years from 2005 to 2008. During the study period, the Kozhikode station recorded an average rainfall of 3500 mm while the Hyderabad station showed an average rainfall of 790 mm. The average stable isotope values in precipitation at the Kozhikode station were 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O= -3.52‰, d-excess = 13.72‰; 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O = -2.94‰, d-excess = 10.57‰; and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O = -7.53‰, d-excess = 13.79‰, respectively during the pre-monsoon (March–May), monsoon (June–September) and post-monsoon (October–February) seasons. For the Hyderabad station, the average stable isotope values were 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O = $−$5.88‰, d-excess = 2.34‰; 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O = $−$4.39‰, d-excess = 9.21‰; and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O = −8.69‰, d-excess = 14.29‰, respectively for the three seasons. The precipitation at the two stations showed distinctive isotopic signatures. The stable isotopic composition of precipitation at the Hyderabad station showed significant variations from the global trend while the Kozhikode station almost followed the global value. These differences are mainly attributed to the latitudinal differences of the two stations coupled with the differences in climatic conditions.</p>

				<title>Impact of gridpoint statistical interpolation scheme over Indian region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1095-1112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An analysis system experiment was conducted for the month of June 2008 with Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis scheme using NCMRWF’s (National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting) T254L64 model. Global analyses were carried out for all days of the month and respective forecast runs are made up to 120-hr. These analyses and forecasts are inter-compared with the operational T254L64 model outputs which uses Spectral Statistical Interpolation (SSI) analysis scheme. The prime objective of this study is to assess the impact of GSI analysis scheme with special emphasis on Indian summer monsoon as compared to SSI.</p>
					<p>GSI analysis scheme do have positive impact over India and its surrounding regions. Though not for all but for some fields it is in edge over Spectral Statistical Analysis Scheme. Patterns for the forecast mean error; anomaly correlation and $S_1$ scores with respect to the respective analyses are same for both GSI and SSI. Both have increasing $S_1$ scores, decreasing mean errors and anomaly correlation with the advance of forecast days. The vector wind RMSE of the model forecasts with respect to the analyses is lower for GSI at 850 hPa and higher at 250 hPa. But over tropics GSI is better at both levels. The temperature field of GSI has higher correlation and lower RMSE at both 850 and 250 hPa pressure levels. There are improvements in systematic errors for 850 and 200 hPa temperature field in GSI compared to that in SSI. The depression centre in GSI analysis is closer to observation but has produced more intense depression compared to that of SSI. Rainfall forecast of SSI is better at day-1 whereas GSI is closer to the observation at day-5 forecasts valid at the same day.</p>

				<title>Development of regional wheat VI-LAI models using Resourcesat-1 AWiFS data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1113-1125</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The time of forcing of spatial LAI to crop models at single or multiple stages is important to simulate crop biomass and yield in varying agro-climatic conditions and scales. The high temporal resolution (5-day) by Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) on-board Resourcesat-1 Satellite IRS-P6 with 56 m spatial resolution and large swath (740 km) has substantially increased the availability of regional clear sky optical remote sensing data. The present study aimed at developing empirical vegetation index VI-LAI models for wheat using AWiFS optical data in four bands and <i>in-situ</i> measurements sampled over five different agro-climatic regions (ACRs) during 2005–2006 followed by validation during 2006–2007. While nonlinear relations exist for all the three normalized indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and Green NDVI, linear relation was the best fit for ratio vegetation index (RVI). Both NDVI and RVI models generally showed better correlation ranges (0.65–0.84 for NDVI and 0.37–0.76 for RVI) than other indices. The common NDVI-LAI model was found to produce lower root mean square errors (RMSE) between 0.5 and 1.1 from pooled model than those between 0.5 and 1.32 from regional models. The rate of substantial increase in errors from NDVILAI model (RMSE of modelled LAI: 0.85 to 1.28) as compared to RVI-LAI model (RMSE of modeled LAI: 1.12 to 1.17) at LAI greater than 3, than below 3 revealed the early saturation of NDVI than RVI. It is therefore recommended that LAI estimates can be used to force crop simulation model up to early vegetative stage based on NDVI and maximum vegetative to reproductive stages based on RVI.</p>

				<title>Trace fossils from Bhuban Formation, Surma Group (Lower to Middle Miocene) of Mizoram India and their palaeoenvironmental significance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1127-1143</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed ichnological study performed on the Bhuban Formation, Surma Group (Lower to Middle Miocene) of Mizoram, India reveals the occurrence of rich and diverse trace fossils. These have been collected from the two localities in Aizawl, i.e., Bawngkawn and Ropaiabawk, where sandstone-shale sequence is well exposed. Total 20 ichnospecies of 14 ichnogenera have been identified which include <i>Arenicolites</i> isp., <i>Cochlichnus anguineus, Helminthopsis abeli, Laevicyclus mongraensis, Ophiomorpha borneensis, Palaeophycus tubularis, Palaeophycus heberti, Palaeophycus sulcatus, Palaeophycus alternatus, Pholeus abomasoformis, Pholeus bifurcatus, Planolites beverleyensis, Planolites annularis, Polykladichnus irregularis, Rhizocorallium isp., Skolithos linearis, Taenidium satanassi, Teichichnus rectus, Thalassinoides horizontalis</i> and <i>Thalassinoides paradoxicus</i>. Ethologically these ichnogenera display dwelling and feeding activities of the infaunal organisms. <i>Arenicolites, Ophiomorpha, Polykladichnus</i> and <i>Skolithos</i> are the members of the <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies while <i>Palaeophycus, Planolites, Rhizocorallium</i> and <i>Thalassinoides</i> are the members of the <i>Cruziana</i> ichnofacies. The presence of <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies indicates sandy shifting substrate and high energy conditions in foreshore zone while the <i>Cruziana</i> ichnofacies indicate unconsolidated, poorly sorted soft substrate and low energy condition in the shoreface/offshore zone. These ichnogenera indicate foreshore to shoreface-offshore zone of shallow marine environment for the deposition of the rocks of the Bhuban Formation of Mizoram.</p>

				<title>Identification of non-indigenous phytoplankton species dominated bloom off Goa using inverted microscopy and pigment (HPLC) analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1145-1154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An unusual phytoplankton bloom dominated by unidentified green coloured spherical algal cells (∼5 𝜇 m diameter) and dinoflagellates (<i>Heterocapsa, Scripsiella</i> and <i>Gymnodinium</i>) was encountered along the coast of Goa, India during 27 and 29 January, 2005. Pigment analysis was carried out using both fluorometric and HPLC methods. Seawater samples collected from various depths within the intense bloom area showed high concentrations of Chl 𝑎 (up to 106 mg m<sup>−3</sup>) associated with low bacterial production (0.31 to 0.52 mg C m<sup>−3</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) and mesozooplankton biomass (0.03 ml m<sup>−3</sup>). Pigment analyses of the seawater samples were done using HPLC detected marker pigments corresponding to prasinophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms. Chlorophyll 𝑏 (36–56%) followed by peridinin (15–30%), prasinoxanthin (11–17%) and fucoxanthin (7–15%) were the major diagnostic pigments while pigments of cryptophytes and cyanobacteria including alloxanthin and zeaxanthin formed &gt; 10%. Although microscopic analysis indicated a decline in the bloom, pheaophytin concentrations in the water column measured by both techniques were very low, presumably due to fast recycling and/or settling rate. The unique composition of the bloom and its probable causes are discussed in this paper.</p>

				<title>Petrotectonic framework of granulites from northern part of Chilka Lake area, Eastern Ghats Belt, India: Compressional vis-à-vis transpressional tectonics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Granulite-facies rocks occurring north-east of the Chilka Lake anothosite (Balugan Massif) show a complex metamorphic and deformation history. The M<sub>1</sub>$–$D<sub>1</sub> stage is identified only through microscopic study by the presence of S<sub>1</sub> internal foliation shown by the M<sub>1</sub> assemblage sillimanite–quartz–plagioclase–biotite within garnet porphyroblasts of the aluminous granulites and this fabric is obliterated in outcrop to map-scale by subsequent deformations. S<sub>2</sub> fabric was developed at peak metamorphic condition (M<sub>2</sub>$–$D<sub>2</sub>­) and is shown by gneissic banding present in all lithological units. S<sub>3</sub> fabric was developed due to D<sub>3</sub> deformation and it is tectonically transposed parallel to S<sub>2</sub> regionally except at the hinge zone of the F<sub>3</sub> folds. The transposed S<sub>2</sub>/S<sub>3</sub> fabric is the regional characteristic structure of the area. The D<sub>4</sub> event produced open upright F<sub>4</sub> folds, but was weak enough to develop any penetrative foliation in the rocks except few spaced cleavages that developed in the quartzite/garnet–sillimanite gneiss. Petrological data suggest that the $M_{4}–D_{4}$ stage actually witnessed reactivation of the lower crust by late distinct tectonothermal event. Presence of transposed $S_{2}/S_{3}$ fabric within the anorthosite arguably suggests that the pluton was emplaced before or during the $M_{3}–D_{3}$ event. Field-based large-scale structural analyses and microfabric analyses of the granulites reveal that this terrain has been evolved through superposed folding events with two broadly perpendicular compression directions without any conclusive evidence for transpressional tectonics as argued by earlier workers. Tectonothermal history of these granulites spanning in Neoproterozoic time period is dominated by compressional tectonics with associated metamorphism at deep crust.</p>

				<title>Temporal and spatial variations in the magnitude of completeness for homogenized moment magnitude catalogue for northeast India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0019-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Northeast India region is one of the most seismically active areas in the world. Events data for the period 1897–2010, used in this study has been largely compiled from global ISC, NEIC and GCMT databases. Historical seismicity catalogue of Gupta <i>et al</i> (1986) and some events data from the bulletins of India Meteorological Department are also used. Orthogonal regression relations for conversion of body and surface wave magnitudes to 𝑀<sub>w,HRVD</sub> based on events data for the period 1978–2006 have been derived. An Orthogonal Standard Regression (OSR) relationship has also been obtained for scaling of intensity estimates to 𝑀_{w,NEIC} using 126 global intensity events with intensity VI or greater during the period 1975–2010.</p>
					<p>Magnitude of completeness and Gutenberg–Richter (GR) recurrence parameter values have been determined for the declustered homogenized catalogue pertaining to four different time periods namely, 1897–1963, 1964–1990, 1964–2000 and 1964–2010. The $M_c$ and ‘𝑏’ values are observed to decrease and increase, respectively, with addition of newer data with time. The study region has been subdivided into nine seismogenic zones keeping in view the spatial variations in earthquake occurrence and prevalent tectonics. $M_c$, ‘𝑏’ and ‘𝑎’ values have been estimated with respect to each zone, and the variations in the values of these parameters have been analysed.</p>

				<title>Fluid–rock interaction across the South Tibetan Detachment, Garhwal Himalaya (India): Mineralogical and geochemical evidences</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0029-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Malari Leucogranite in the Garhwal Himalaya is cut across by a continental-scale normal fault system called the South Tibetan Detachment (STD). A mineralogical, geochemical and fluid inclusion study of samples from the fault zone of the Malari Granite was performed to reveal the imprints of fluid–rock interaction. Fluid inclusion assemblages observed in the alteration zone indicate the presence of NaCl-dominated aqueous fluids with varied salinity of 6 –16 wt.% of NaCl equivalent. Mineralogical changes include the alteration of feldspar to muscovite and muscovite to chlorite. This alteration took place at temperatures of 275&#176;$–$335&#176;C and pressures between 1.9 and 4.2 kbars as revealed by the application of chlorite thermometry, fluid isochores, and presence of K-feldspar+muscovite+chlorite+quartz mineral assemblage. Geochemical mass-balance estimates predict 32% volume loss during alteration. An estimated fluid/rock ratio of 82 is based on loss of silica during alteration, and reveals presence of a moderately low amount of fluid at the time of faulting.</p>
					<p>Results of fluid inclusion and alteration mineralogy indicate that the Malari Leucogranites were exhumed due to normal faulting along the STD and erosion from mid-crustal levels. Most of the leucogranites in the Himalayas occur along the STD and possibly a regional-scale fluid flow all along the STD might have caused similar alteration of leucogranites along this tectonic break. Regional fluid flow was probably concentrated along the STD and channelized through mesoscopic fractures, microcracks and grain boundaries.</p>

				<title>A genetic algorithm approach for assessing soil liquefaction potential based on reliability method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0045-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deterministic approaches are unable to account for the variations in soil’s strength properties, earthquake loads, as well as source of errors in evaluations of liquefaction potential in sandy soils which make them questionable against other reliability concepts. Furthermore, deterministic approaches are incapable of precisely relating the probability of liquefaction and the factor of safety (FS). Therefore, the use of probabilistic approaches and especially, reliability analysis is considered since a complementary solution is needed to reach better engineering decisions. In this study, Advanced First-Order Second-Moment (AFOSM) technique associated with genetic algorithm (GA) and its corresponding sophisticated optimization techniques have been used to calculate the reliability index and the probability of liquefaction. The use of GA provides a reliable mechanism suitable for computer programming and fast convergence. A new relation is developed here, by which the liquefaction potential can be directly calculated based on the estimated probability of liquefaction ($P_L$), cyclic stress ratio (CSR) and normalized standard penetration test (SPT) blow counts while containing a mean error of less than 10% from the observational data. The validity of the proposed concept is examined through comparison of the results obtained by the new relation and those predicted by other investigators. A further advantage of the proposed relation is that it relates $P_L$ and FS and hence it provides possibility of decision making based on the liquefaction risk and the use of deterministic approaches. This could be beneficial to geotechnical engineers who use the common methods of FS for evaluation of liquefaction. As an application, the city of Babolsar which is located on the southern coasts of Caspian Sea is investigated for liquefaction potential. The investigation is based primarily on <i>in situ</i> tests in which the results of SPT are analysed.</p>

				<title>Suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution, and their relationship with heavy metal content</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper aims at assessing the feasibility of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) estimation by using predictor variables of heavy metal concentration (HMC, viz., iron, chromium, zinc and nickel) transported in solution and solid. The study was conducted in the Research and Educational Forest Watershed of the Tarbiat Modares University (Kojour) which comprises an area of ca. 50000 ha. For this study, suspended sediment samples were collected from the left bank of the Kojour River twice a week, as well as during runoff events from November 2007 to June 2008. The samples were then prepared through direct digestion and finally analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The relationship between SSC and particle size distribution (PSD) were correlated with HMC by using bivariate and multivariate regression models. Proposed models were then selected based on statistical criteria. The results showed high correlation between dissolved and particulate chromium content with efficiency coefficients beyond 77% (𝑃 &gt; 0.001). However, a lower relationship was found between SSC and nickel content. From these results, it is clearly shown that the HMC can practically be estimated by SSC in watersheds with different accuracy and vice versa. It is also understood that heavy metal pollution can be easily managed by controlling SSC.</p>

				<title>Depositional environment and provenance of Middle Siwalik sediments in Tista valley, Darjiling District, Eastern Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0073-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The frontal part of the active, wedge-shaped Indo-Eurasian collision boundary is defined by the Himalayan fold-and-thrust belt whose foreland basin accumulated sediments that eventually became part of the thrust belt and is presently exposed as the sedimentary rocks of the Siwalik Group. The rocks of the Siwalik Group have been extensively studied in the western and Nepal Himalaya and have been divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Subgroups. In the Darjiling–Sikkim Himalaya, the Upper Siwalik sequence is not exposed and the Middle Siwalik Subgroup exposed in the Tista river valley of Darjiling Himalaya preserves a ∼325 m thick sequence of sandstone, conglomerate and shale. The Middle Siwalik section has been repeated by a number of north dipping thrusts. The sedimentary facies and facies associations within the lithostratigraphic column of the Middle Siwalik rocks show temporal repetition of sedimentary facies associations suggesting oscillation between proximal-, mid- and distal fan setups within a palaeo-alluvial fan depositional environment similar to the depositional setup of the Siwalik sediments in other parts of the Himalaya. These oscillations are probably due to a combination of foreland-ward movement of Himalayan thrusts, climatic variations and mountain-ward shift of fanapex due to erosion. The Middle Siwalik sediments were derived from Higher- and Lesser Himalayan rocks. Mineral characteristics and modal analysis suggest that sedimentation occurred in humid climatic conditions similar to the moist humid climate of the present day Eastern Himalaya.</p>

				<title>Mineral chemistry of lava flows from Linga area of the Eastern Deccan Volcanic Province, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0091-0108</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several basaltic lava flows have been identified in the study area in and around Linga, in the Eastern Deccan Volcanic Province (EDVP) on the basis of distinctly developed structural zones defined by primary volcanic structures such as columnar joints and vesicles. These basaltic lava flows are spatially distributed in four different sectors, viz., (i) Bargona–Gadarwara (BG) sector (ii) Shikarpur–Linga (SL) sector (iii) Arjunvari–Survir Hill (AS) sector and (iv) Kukrachiman–Morand Hill (KM) sector. A threetier classification scheme has been adopted for the characterization and classification of individual lava flows. Each lava flow consists of a Lower Colonnade Zone (LCZ) overlain by the Entablature Zone (EZ) and Upper Colonnade Zone (UCZ). The LCZ and UCZ grade into a distinct/indistinct Lower Vesicular Zone (LVZ) and Upper Vesicular Zone (UVZ), respectively. The LCZ and UCZ of the flows are characterized by columnar joints while the EZ is marked by multi-directional hackly jointing. The geometry of different joint patterns corresponds to different styles of cooling during solidification of lava flows. Detailed petrographic studies of the investigated lava flows reveal inequigranular phenocrystal basalts characterized by development of phenocrystal phases including plagioclase, clinopyroxene and olivine, whereas groundmass composition is marked by tiny plagioclase, clinopyroxene, opaque mineral and glass. Electron microprobe analyses indicate that the olivine has a wide range ∼Fo<sub>22</sub> to Fo<sub>66</sub> revealing a wide spectrum of compositional variation. Pyroxene compositions are distinctly designated as Quad pyroxenes. Phenocrystal pyroxenes are mostly diopsidic, while the groundmass pyroxenes mainly correspond to augite with a minor pigeonite component. Pyroxene phenocrysts are characterized by a prominent Tienrichment. Phenocrystal plagioclase grains are calcic (An<sub>52.7</sub>$–$An<sub>72.9</sub>), whereas groundmass plagioclase are relatively sodic (An<sub>39.2</sub>$–$An<sub>61.6</sub>). Groundmass opaque minerals are characteristically found to be Ti–magnetite/ilmenite/pyrophanite. Pyroxene thermometry reveals a temperature span of 850&#176; to 1280&#176;C for the studied lavas while olivine–clinopyroxene thermometry yields a temperature range from 1040&#176;$–$1160&#176;C. The variation of temperature for the lava flows is ascribed to their normal cooling history after eruption.</p>

				<title>Hydrochemistry of surface water and groundwater from a fractured carbonate aquifer in the Helwan area, Egypt</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0109-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groundwater is an important water resource in the Helwan area, not only for drinking and agricultural purposes, but also because several famous mineral springs have their origin in the fractured carbonate aquifer of the region. The area is heavily populated with a high density of industrial activities which may pose a risk for groundwater and surface water resources. The groundwater and surface water quality was investigated as a basis for more future investigations. The results revealed highly variable water hydrochemistry. High values of chloride, sulphate, hardness and significant mineralization were detected under the industrial and high-density urban areas. High nitrate contents in the groundwater recorded in the southern part of the study area are probably due to irrigation and sewage infiltrations from the sewage treatment station. The presence of shale and marl intercalation within the fissured and cavernous limestone aquifer promotes the exchange reactions and dissolution processes. The groundwater type is sodium, sulphate, chloride reflecting more mineralized than surface water. The results also showed that water in the study area (except the Nile water) is unsuitable for drinking purposes, but it can be used for irrigation and industrial purposes with some restrictions.</p>

					<p>This paper evaluates the performance of three soft computing techniques, namely Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) (Zakaria <i>et al</i> 2010), Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) (Ab Ghani <i>et al</i> 2011), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in the prediction of total bed material load for three Malaysian rivers namely Kurau, Langat and Muda. The results of present study are very promising: FFNN (𝑅^{2} = 0.958, RMSE = 0.0698), ANFIS (𝑅^{2} = 0.648, RMSE = 6.654), and GEP (𝑅^{2} = 0.97, RMSE = 0.057), which support the use of these intelligent techniques in the prediction of sediment loads in tropical rivers.</p>

				<title>Holocene climatic fluctuations from Lower Brahmaputra flood plain of Assam, northeast India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0135-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pollen analysis of a 3.2-m deep sedimentary profile cored from the Dabaka Swamp, Nagaon District, Lower Brahmaputra flood plain, Assam has revealed persistent fluvial activity during 14,120–12,700 cal years BP which may be attributed to the paucity of pollen and spores with encounterance of fluvial marker taxa like <i>Ludwigia octavalvis</i> and <i>Botryococcus</i>. Later, fluvial activity was succeeded by the tropical tree savanna under cool and dry climate between 12,700 and 11,600 cal years BP corresponding to that of global Younger Dryas. Between 11,600 and 8310 cal years BP, relatively less cool and dry climate prevailed with inception of tropical mixed deciduous taxa like <i>Shorea robusta</i> and <i>Lagerstroemia parviflora</i>. This phase is further followed by a fluvial activity between 8310 and 7100 cal years BP as evidenced by trace values of pollen and spores. Fluvial activity was further succeeded by enrichment of tropical mixed deciduous forest under warm and humid climatic regime between 7100 and 1550 cal years BP which is well-matched with the peak period of the Holocene climatic optimum. However, during 1550–768 cal years BP, final settlement of tropical mixed deciduous forest occurred under increased warm and humid climate followed by deterioration in tropical mixed deciduous forest under warm and relatively dry climatic regime since 768 cal years BP onwards due to acceleration in human settlement as evidenced by Cerealia. Increase in <i>Melastoma, Ziziphus</i> and <i>Areca catechu</i> imply forest clearance at this phase. The occurrence of degraded pollen-spore along with adequate fungal elements especially, <i>Xylaria, Nigrospora</i> and Microthyriaceous fruiting body is suggestive of aerobic microbial digenesis of rich organic debris during sedimentation.</p>

				<title>Geomorphological evidences of post-LGM glacial advancements in the Himalaya: A study from Chorabari Glacier, Garhwal Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0149-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Field geomorphology and remote sensing data, supported by Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating from the Mandakini river valley of the Garhwal Himalaya enabled identification of four major glacial events; Rambara Glacial Stage (RGS) (13 ± 2 ka), Ghindurpani Glacial Stage (GhGS) (9 ± 1 ka), Garuriya Glacial Stage (GGS) (7 ± 1 ka) and Kedarnath Glacial Stage (KGS) (5 ± 1 ka). RGS was the most extensive glaciation extending for ∼6 km down the valley from the present day snout and lowered to an altitude of 2800 m asl at Rambara covering around ∼31 km<sup>2</sup> area of the Mandakini river valley. Compared to this, the other three glaciations (viz., GhGS, GGS and KGS) were of lower magnitudes terminating around ∼3000, ∼3300 and ∼3500 m asl, respectively. It was also observed that the mean equilibrium line altitude (ELA) during RGS was lowered to 4747 m asl compared to the present level of 5120 m asl. This implies an ELA depression of ∼373 m during the RGS which would correspond to a lowering of ∼2&#176;C summer temperature during the RGS. The results are comparable to that of the adjacent western and central Himalaya implying a common forcing factor that we attribute to the insolation-driven monsoon precipitation in the western and central Himalaya.</p>

				<title>Late Quaternary fine silt deposits of Jammu, NW Himalaya: Genesis and climatic significance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0165-0182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The fine silt deposits of Jammu (J &amp; K State, India) stretch all along the Siwalik foothills from Jammu to the Potwar Plateau in Pakistan. The post-Siwalik deposits, first discussed by de Terra and Paterson (1939), are attributed to wind action. The deposits termed as ‘Potwar loessic silt’ comprising sandy silt are essentially of late Quaternary age (75–18 ka) and are re-looked herein from the point of view of genesis and climatic significance. The sorting, skewness and kurtosis parameters of fine silts of Jammu suggest fluvial environment of the deposits wherein the water budget fluctuated. The weak pedogenesis of fine silts at certain intervals corroborate to periods of less or no sedimentation. The bivariant plot studies further suggest fluvial environment of deposition for the fine silt at Jammu, with regular fluctuations in the budget of river water that was perhaps in consonance with oscillations in the climate of the region.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A new fossil fruit wing of <i>Shorea</i> Roxb. belonging to the family Dipterocarpaceae is described from the Early Miocene sediments of Kachchh, Gujarat. It resembles best the extant species <i>Shorea macroptera</i> Dyer, which is a prominent member of the tropical evergreen forests of the Malayan Peninsula. The present finding, along with the other megafossil records described from the same area, indicates a  typical tropical vegetation with a warm and humid climate at the time of deposition in contrast to the present day xeric vegetation in the area. As the family Dipterocarpaceae no longer exists in western India, it is essential to discuss the time of its extinction and possible causes, which may include drastic changes in the climate of the region. The present finding also supports the theory of a Malaysian origin for the family in contrast to the hypothesis of a Gondwanan origin.</p>

				<title>Impact of global warming on cyclonic disturbances over south Asian region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0203-0210</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A state-of-the-art regional climate modelling system, known as PRECIS (Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies) developed by the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, UK is applied over the Indian domain to investigate the impact of global warming on the cyclonic disturbances such as depressions and storms. The PRECIS simulations at 50 &#215; 50 km horizontal resolution are made for two time slices, present (1961–1990) and the future (2071–2100), for two socioeconomic scenarios A2 and B2. The model simulations under the scenarios of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosols are analysed to study the likely changes in the frequency, intensity and the tracks of cyclonic disturbances forming over north Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) and the Indian landmass during monsoon season. The model overestimates the frequency of cyclonic disturbances over the Indian subcontinent in baseline simulations (1961–1990). The change is evaluated towards the end of present century (2071–2100) with respect to the baseline climate. The present study indicates that the storm tracks simulated by the model are southwards as compared to the observed tracks during the monsoon season, especially for the two main monsoon months, viz., July and August. The analysis suggests that the frequency of cyclonic disturbances forming over north Indian Ocean is likely to reduce by 9% towards the end of the present century in response to the global warming. However, the intensity of cyclonic disturbances is likely to increase by about 11% compared to the present.</p>

				<title>Audible thunder characteristic and the relation between peak frequency and lightning parameters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0211-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In recent summers, some natural lightning optical spectra and audible thunder signals were observed. Twelve events on 15 August 2008 are selected as samples since some synchronizing information about them are obtained, such as lightning optical spectra, surface E-field changes, etc. By using digital filter and Fourier transform, thunder frequency spectra in observation location have been calculated. Then the two main propagation effects, finite amplitude propagation and attenuation by air, are calculated. Upon that we take the test thunder frequency spectra and work backward to recalculate the original frequency spectra near generation location. Thunder frequency spectra and the frequency distribution varying with distance are researched. According to the theories on plasma, the channel temperature and electron density are further calculated by transition parameters of lines in lightning optical spectra. Pressure and the average ionization degree of each discharge channel are obtained by using Saha equations, charge conservation equations and particle conservation equations. Moreover, the relationship between the peak frequency of each thunder and channel parameters of the lightning is studied.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric aerosol characteristics retrieved using ground based solar extinction studies at Mohal in the Kullu valley of northwestern Himalayan region, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0221-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol parameters are measured using a ground-based Multi-wavelength Radiometer (MWR) at Mohal (31.90&#176;N, 77.11&#176;E, 1154 m amsl) in the Kullu valley during clear sky days of a seasonal year. The study shows that the values of spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) at 500 nm and the Ångstrom turbidity coefficient ‘𝛽’ (a measure of columnar loading in atmosphere) are high (0.41 ± 0.03, 0.27 ± 0.01) in summer, moderate (0.30 ± 0.03, 0.15 ± 0.03) in monsoon, low (0.19 ± 0.02, 0.08 ± 0.01) in winter and lowest (0.18 ± 0.01, 0.07 ± 0.01) in autumn, respectively. The Ångstrom wavelength exponent ‘𝛼’ (indicator of the fraction of accumulation-mode particles to coarse-mode particles) has an opposite trend having lowest value (0.64 ± 0.06) in summer, low (0.99 ± 0.10) in monsoon, moderate (1.20 ± 0.15) in winter and highest value (1.52 ± 0.03) in autumn. The annual mean value of AOD at 500 nm, ‘𝛼’ and ‘𝛽’ are 0.24 ± 0.01, 1.06 ± 0.09 and 0.14 ± 0.01, respectively. The fractional asymmetry factor is more negative in summer due to enhanced tourists’ arrival and also in autumn months due to the monthlong International Kullu Dussehra fair. The AOD values given by MWR and satellite-based moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer have good correlation of 0.76, 0.92 and 0.97 on diurnal, monthly and seasonal basis, respectively. The AODs at 500 nm as well as ‘𝛽’ are found to be highly correlated, while ‘𝛼’ is found to be strongly anti-correlated with temperature and wind speed suggesting high AODs and turbidity but low concentration of fine particles during hot and windy days. With wind direction, the AOD and ‘𝛽’ are found to be strongly anti-correlated, while ‘𝛼’ is strongly correlated.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>It has been established that radon and its airborne decay products can present serious radiation hazards. A long term exposure to high concentration of radon causes lung cancer. Besides, it is also known that out of the total radiation dose received from natural and man-made sources, 60% of the dose is due to radon and its progeny. Taking this into account, an attempt has been made to estimate radon concentration in dwellings in and around Guwahati using aluminium dosimeter cups with CR-39 plastic detectors. Results of preliminary investigation presented in this paper show that the mean concentration is 21.31 Bq m<sup>−3</sup>.</p>

				<page>0241-0250</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study was carried out to evaluate the seasonal variations of seaweed biomass and species composition at six different sites along the coastal areas in Bushehr Province. Sampling depths varied among sites, from 0.3 to 2.0 m below mean sea level. A total of 37 (i.e., 10 Chlorophyta, 12 Phaeophyta and 15 Rhodophyta) seaweed species were collected. Studies were conducted for quantifying the seaweeds during four seasons from October 2008 until July 2009. During present research, <i>Ulva intestinalis</i> and <i>Cladophora nitellopsis</i> of green, <i>Polycladia myrica, Sirophysalia trinodis</i> and <i>Sargassum angustifolium</i> of brown and <i>Gracilaria canaliculata</i> and <i>Hypnea cervicornis</i> of red seaweeds showed highest biomass in coastal areas of Bushehr Province. The Cheney’s ratio of 2.1 indicated a temperate algal flora to this area. All sites exhibited more than 50% similarity of algal species, indicating a relatively homogenous algal distribution. Total biomass showed the highest value of 3280.7 ± 537.8 g dry wt m<sup>−2</sup> during summer and lowest value of 856.9 ± 92.0 g dry wt m<sup>−2</sup> during winter. During this study, the highest and lowest seaweed biomass were recorded on the site 2 (2473.7 ± 311.0 g dry wt m<sup>−2</sup>) and site 5 (856.7 ± 96.8 g dry wt m<sup>−2</sup>), respectively.</p>

				<title>Altimeter data assimilation in the tropical Indian Ocean using water property conserving scheme</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0251-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Altimeter data have been assimilated in an ocean general circulation model using the water property conserving scheme. Two runs of the model have been conducted for the year 2004. In one of the runs, altimeter data have been assimilated sequentially, while in another run, assimilation has been suppressed. Assimilation has been restricted to the tropical Indian Ocean. An assessment of the strength of the scheme has been carried out by comparing the sea surface temperature (SST), simulated in the two runs, with <i>in situ</i> derived as well as remotely sensed observations of the same quantity. It has been found that the assimilation exhibits a significant positive impact on the simulation of SST. The subsurface effect of the assimilation could be judged by comparing the model simulated depth of the 20&#176;C isotherm (hereafter referred to as D20), as a proxy of the thermocline depth, with the same quantity estimated from ARGO observations. In this case also, the impact is noteworthy. Effect on the dynamics has been judged by comparison of simulated surface current with observed current at a moored buoy location, and finally the impact on model sea level forecast in a free run after assimilation has been quantified in a representative example.</p>

				<title>Impact of continental meteorology and atmospheric circulation in the modulation of Aerosol Optical Depth over the Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0263-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time series analysis of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from NOAA-AVHRR data during the period 1996–1999 and the MODIS data during 2000–2009 over the Arabian Sea revealed a systematic biennial variability in the high AOD during summer months. The variability is more prominent over the northern and central parts of the Arabian Sea and became less significant towards southern latitudes. The possible mechanisms for these are examined by estimating the source strength over coastal Arabia and AOD flow rate through the western boundary of the Arabian Sea. Both these show clear signatures of biennial variability with same phase as AOD for most of the years. This result indicates that the observed biennial variability in AOD is likely to be the outcome of combined effects of biennial variability in wind generated sea-salt aerosols and dust transported from Arabia.</p>

				<title>Development of multimodel ensemble based district level medium range rainfall forecast system for Indian region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0273-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India Meteorological Department has implemented district level medium range rainfall forecast system applying multimodel ensemble technique, making use of model outputs of state-of-the-art global models from the five leading global NWP centres. The pre-assigned grid point weights on the basis of anomaly correlation coefficients (CC) between the observed values and forecast values are determined for each constituent model at the resolution of $0.25&#176; &#215; 0.25&#176; utilizing two season datasets (1 June–30 September, 2007 and 2008) and the multimodel ensemble forecasts (day-1 to day-5 forecasts) are generated at the same resolution on a real-time basis. The ensemble forecast fields are then used to prepare forecasts for each district, taking the average value of all grid points falling in a particular district. In this paper, we describe the development strategy of the technique and performance skill of the system during summer monsoon 2009. The study demonstrates the potential of the system for improving rainfall forecasts at five days time scale over Indian region. Districtwise performance of the ensemble rainfall forecast reveals that the technique, in general, is capable of providing reasonably good forecast skill over most states of the country, particularly over the states where the monsoon systems are more dominant.</p>

				<title>Rainfall and temperature scenarios for Bangladesh for the middle of 21st century using RegCM</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0287-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Regional Climate Model of version 3 (RegCM3) was driven with Emissions Scenarios A2 of ECHAM4 at 0.54&#176; &#215; 0.54&#176; horizontal grid resolution in two parameterizations: Grell scheme with Arakawa–Schubert (GAS) and Fritch–Chappell (GFC) assumptions. The simulated rainfall and mean surface air temperature were calibrated and validated against ground-based observed data in Bangladesh during the period 1961–1990. The Climate Research Unit (CRU) data is also used for understanding the model performance. Better performance of RegCM3 obtained through validation process, made it confident in utilizing it in rainfall and temperature projection for Bangladesh in the middle of 21st century. Rainfall and mean surface air temperature projection for Bangladesh is experimentally obtained for 2050 and 2060. This work discloses that simulated rainfall and temperature are not directly useful in application-oriented tasks. However, after calibration and validation, reasonable performance can be obtained in estimating seasonal and annual rainfall, and mean surface air temperature in Bangladesh. The projected change of rainfall for Bangladesh is about +35% for monsoon season (JJAS), −67% for pre-monsoon (MAM), −12% for post-monsoon (ON) and 107% for winter (DJF) for 2050. On an average, rainfall may be less by more than 50% for all seasons for the year 2060. Similarly, change of mean surface air temperature in different months is projected about 0.5&#176;–2.1&#176;C and 0.9&#176;–3.5&#176;C for the year 2050 and 2060, respectively.</p>

				<title>The diagnosis of severe thunderstorms with high-resolution WRF model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0297-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thunderstorm, resulting from vigorous convective activity, is one of the most spectacular weather phenomena in the atmosphere. A common feature of the weather during the pre-monsoon season over the Indo-Gangetic Plain and northeast India is the outburst of severe local convective storms, commonly known as ‘Nor’westers’(as they move from northwest to southeast). The severe thunderstorms associated with thunder, squall lines, lightning and hail cause extensive losses in agricultural, damage to structure and also loss of life. In this paper, sensitivity experiments have been conducted with the Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) to test the impact of three microphysical schemes in capturing the severe thunderstorm event occurred over Kolkata on 15 May 2009. The results show that the WRF-NMM model with Ferrier microphysical scheme appears to reproduce the cloud and precipitation processes more realistically than other schemes. Also, we have made an attempt to diagnose four severe thunderstorms that occurred during pre-monsoon seasons of 2006, 2007 and 2008 through the simulated radar reflectivity fields from NMM model with Ferrier microphysics scheme and validated the model results with Kolkata Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) observations. Composite radar reflectivity simulated by WRF-NMM model clearly shows the severe thunderstorm movement as observed by DWR imageries, but failed to capture the intensity as in observations. The results of these analyses demonstrated the capability of high resolution WRF-NMM model in the simulation of severe thunderstorm events and determined that the 3 km model improve upon current abilities when it comes to simulating severe thunderstorms over east Indian region.</p>

				<title>The performance of different cumulus parameterization schemes in simulating the 2006/2007 southern peninsular Malaysia heavy rainfall episodes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0317-0327</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The performance of four different cumulus parameterization schemes (CPS) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for simulating three heavy rainfall episodes over the southern peninsular Malaysia during the winter monsoon of 2006/2007 were examined. The modelled rainfall was compared with the 3-hourly satellite observation and objectively scored using a verification technique called the acuity–fidelity. The technique is based on minimization of a cost function that is calculated from four parameters taking into account errors in distance, time, intensity, and missed events. All simulations were made for 72 hours for the three episodes starting at 1200 UTC 17 December 2006, 1200 UTC 24 December 2006 and 1200 UTC 11 January 2007, respectively. The four different CPSs used are the new Kain–Fritsch scheme (KF2), the Betts–Miller–Janjic scheme (BMJ), the Grell–Devenyi ensemble scheme (GD) and the older Kain–Fritsch scheme (KF1). While the BMJ scheme shows some success in the second and third episodes, it shows high location errors in the first episode, leading to high acuity errors. The GD, KF2 and KF1 schemes performed poorly, although both the BMJ and GD schemes simulated the observed drastic increase of rainfall at 2100 UTC 18 December 2006 during the first episode. Overall, the KF1 and KF2 schemes produced positive biases in terms of coverage, while the GD scheme showed persistent location bias, producing a scattered line of precipitation over the eastern coastline of peninsular Malaysia. Although the BMJ scheme has better results, its poor performance for the first episode suggests that suitability of CPS may be case dependent.</p>

				<title>Wintertime land surface characteristics in climatic simulations over the western Himalayas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0329-0344</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wintertime regional climate studies over the western Himalayas with ICTP-RegCM3 simulations through 22 years has shown systematic biases in precipitation and temperature fields. The model simulated precipitation shows systematically wet bias. In surface temperature simulations, positive and negative biases of 2&#176;–4&#176;C occurred. Experiment without (CONT) and with subBATS (SUB) shows that later scheme performs better, especially for precipitation. Apart from the role of topography and model internal variability, land surface characteristics also have profound impact on these climatic variables. Therefore, in the present study, impacts of land surface characteristics are investigated through cool/wet and warm/dry winter climate by CONT and SUB simulations to assess systematic biases. Since SUB experiment uses detailed land-use classification, systematic positive biases in temperature over higher elevation peaks are markedly reduced. The change has shown reduced excessive precipitation as well. Most of the surface characteristics show that major interplay between topography and western disturbances (WDs) takes place along the foothills rather than over the higher peaks of the western Himalayas.</p>

				<title>Ionospheric irregularities at Antarctic using GPS measurements</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0345-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The purpose of this work is to study the behaviour of the ionospheric scintillation at high latitude during geomagnetically quiet and disturbed conditions which is one of the most relevant themes in the space weather studies. Scintillation is a major problem in navigation application using GPS and in satellite communication at high latitudes. Severe amplitude fading and strong scintillation affect the reliability of GPS navigational system and satellite communication. To study the effects of the ionospheric scintillations, GPS receiver installed at Antarctic station Maitri (Geog. 70.76&#176;S; 11.74&#176;E) was used. The data is collected by using GISTM 4004A, NOVATEL’S GPS receiver during March 2008. Studies show that percentage occurrence of phase scintillation is well correlated with geomagnetic activity during the observation period. The result also shows that very intense scintillations can degrade GPS based location determination due to loss of lock of satellites. These findings indicate that the dependence of scintillations and irregularity occurrence on geomagnetic activity is associated with the magnetic local time (MLT). Large number of patches are reported and their activity depends on the magnetic activity index.</p>

				<title>Development of a perfect prognosis probabilistic model for prediction of lightning over south-east India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0355-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A prediction model based on the perfect prognosis method was developed to predict the probability of lightning and probable time of its occurrence over the south-east Indian region. In the perfect prognosis method, statistical relationships are established using past observed data. For real time applications, the predictors are derived from a numerical weather prediction model. In the present study, we have developed the statistical model based on Binary Logistic Regression technique. For developing the statistical model, 115 cases of lightning that occurred over the south-east Indian region during the period 2006–2009 were considered. The probability of lightning (yes or no) occurring during the 12-hour period 0900–2100 UTC over the region was considered as the predictand. The thermodynamic and dynamic variables derived from the NCEP Final Analysis were used as the predictors. A three-stage strategy based on Spearman Rank Correlation, Cumulative Probability Distribution and Principal Component Analysis was used to objectively select the model predictors from a pool of 61 potential predictors considered for the analysis. The final list of six predictors used in the model consists of the parameters representing atmospheric instability, total moisture content in the atmosphere, low level moisture convergence and lower tropospheric temperature advection. For the independent verifications, the probabilistic model was tested for 92 days during the months of May, June and August 2010. The six predictors were derived from the 24-h predictions using a high resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model initialized with 00 UTC conditions. During the independent period, the probabilistic model showed a probability of detection of 77% with a false alarm rate of 35%. The Brier Skill Score during the independent period was 0.233, suggesting that the prediction scheme is skillful in predicting the lightning probability over the south-east region with a reasonable accuracy.</p>

				<title>Surface ozone scenario at Pune and Delhi during the decade of 1990s</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0373-0383</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Data on surface ozone concentration compiled for a 10-year period from 1990 to 1999 for Pune and Delhi are analyzed in terms of its frequency distribution, annual trend, diurnal variation and its relation with various meteorological and chemical parameters. It is found that the surface ozone concentration range showing highest frequency of occurrence at Pune is 0–5 ppb during winter and post-monsoon seasons and 15–20 ppb and 5–10 ppb during summer and monsoon seasons, respectively. It is 0–5 ppb at Delhi during all the seasons. The surface ozone concentration has shown a decreasing trend at Pune during the observational period with an average rate of decrease of 1.54 ppb/year. On the other hand, there is no trend whatsoever in the variation of surface ozone concentration at Delhi. Minimum value of surface ozone occurs before sunrise and maximum in the afternoon hours. Regression analyses of surface ozone with maximum temperature (𝑟 = 0.46 for Pune and 0.51 for Delhi, significant at more than 0.1%) and NO<sub>2</sub> at respective locations indicate that surface ozone at these locations is mainly produced by photochemistry. Transport mechanism is also understood to have contributed significantly to the total concentration of ozone. Inverse relationship obtained between surface ozone concentration and relative humidity indicates that major photochemical paths for removal of ozone become effective when humidity increases at these locations.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0385-0392</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wave prediction and hindcast studies are important in ocean engineering, coastal infrastructure development and management. In view of sparse and infrequent <i>in-situ</i> observations, model derived hindcast wave data can be used for the assessment of wave climate in offshore and coastal areas. In the present study, MIKE 21 SW Model has been used to carry out wave hindcast experiments in the Indian Ocean. Model runs have been made for the year 2005 using QuickSCAT scatterometer winds blended with ECMWF model winds. In order to study the impact of southern ocean swells, the model has been run in two different domains, with the southern boundary being shifted far south for the Domain 60S model. The model simulated wave parameters have been validated by comparing with buoy and altimeter data and various statistical yardsticks have been employed to quantify the validation. Possible reason for the poorer performance of the model in the Arabian Sea has also been pointed out.</p>

				<title>Variations in nearshore waves along Karnataka, west coast of India</title>

				<page>0393-0403</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wind wave spectra were recorded simultaneously at three shallow (water depth 7–9 m) locations (Malpe, Honnavar and Karwar) along the 200 km stretch of the state of Karnataka in 2009 during 27 April–24 May (representing conditions prior to onset of the Indian summer monsoon), 12 June–8 July (monsoon), and 1–31 October (post-monsoon). Each spectrum was based on data recorded for half an hour using a waverider buoy. The paper describes characteristics of the spectra and the wave parameters derived from the spectra. Both reveal the dramatic changes that occur in the wave field due to the summer monsoon. The changes were virtually identical at all the three locations suggesting that the wave characteristics described here are representative of the conditions that exist along the coast of Karnataka State, west coast of India.</p>

				<title>Lower Oligocene bivalves of Ramanian Stage from Kachchh, Gujarat, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0405-0438</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Marine Oligocene sequences in India outcrop only in western part of Kachchh. Earlier researchers have recognized the Oligocene strata under the Nari Series (Nagappa 1959; Chatterji and Mathur 1966). The Nari Series has a type area in Pakistan. It has two subdivisions – the Lower Nari (Lower Oligocene) and the Upper Nari (Upper Oligocene). It seems that there is no valid proof about the age of the Lower Nari due to lack of proper fauna (Eames 1975), and according to Pascoe (1962), the Upper Nari slightly transgress into Aquitanian (Lower Miocene), therefore, one has to be very cautious. Biswas and Raju (1971) reclassified the Oligocene strata of Kachchh and lithostratigraphically clubbed them as the Maniyara Fort Formation with type section along the Bermoti stream. This Formation has four members. The lower three members correspond to the Ramanian Stage (Lower Oligocene, Biswas 1971, 1973) while the uppermost to the Waiorian Stage (Upper Oligocene, Biswas 1965, 1971, 1973). The Ramanian Stage is characterized by large forams especially <i>Nummulites fichteli, Nummulites fichteli intermedius, Lepidocyclina (Eulepidina) dialata</i> and <i>Operculina</i> sp. Several ostracods are also known to occur. Megafauna include bivalves, gastropods, echinoids, corals, mammals and reptiles. Concerning bivalves earlier researchers have recorded a few taxa namely <i>Trisidos semitorta</i> (Lamarck), <i>Cubitostrea angulata</i> (J de C Sowerby), <i>Pecten (Amussiopecten) labadyei</i> d’Archiac and Haime, <i>Periglypta puerpera</i> (Linne’) var. <i>aglaurae</i> Brongniart, <i>Ostrea fraasi</i> Mayer Eymer and listed <i>Pecten laevicostatus</i> J de C Sowerby, <i>Callista pseudoumbonella</i> Vredenburg and <i>Clementia papyracea</i> (Gray) from Kachchh as against overall 42 forms from the Nari Series as a whole (Vredenburg 1928). This tempted us to make an attempt to collect bivalve fauna systematically which are occurring prolifically in the Ramanian Stage. In the present work, for this purpose, sections are worked out around Lakhpat (23&#176; 50&#8242;N; 68&#176; 47&#8242;&#8242;E), Maniyara Fort (23&#176; 28&#8242; 05&#8242;&#8242;N; 68&#176; 37&#8242;E) Rakhdi Dam (23&#176; 27&#8242; 26&#8242;&#8242;N; 68&#176; 40&#8242; 10&#8242;&#8242;E) and Waior (23&#176;25&#8242; 05&#8242;&#8242;N;: 68&#176; 41&#8242; 37&#8242;&#8242;E) with a view to highlight the entombed bivalve taxa. Authors have encountered 53 species of which 23 are restricted to the Ramanian Stage.</p>

				<title>Spatial variation of the aftershock activity across the Kachchh Rift Basin and its seismotectonic implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0439-0451</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analyzed 3365 relocated aftershocks with magnitude of completeness (<i>Mc</i>) &#8805; 1.7 that occurred in the Kachchh Rift Basin (KRB) between August 2006 and December 2010. The analysis of the new aftershock catalogue has led to improved understanding of the subsurface structure and of the aftershock behaviour. We characterized aftershock behaviour in terms of 𝑎-value, 𝑏-value, spatial fractal dimension ($D_s$), and slip ratio (ratio of the slip that occurred on the primary fault and that of the total slip). The estimated 𝑏-value is 1.05, which indicates that the earthquake occurred due to active tectonics in the region. The three dimensional 𝑏-value mapping shows that a high 𝑏-value region is sandwiched around the 2001 Bhuj mainshock hypocenter at depths of 20–25 km between two low 𝑏-value zones above and below this depth range. The $D_s$-value was estimated from the double-logarithmic plot of the correlation integral and distance between hypocenters, and is found to be 2.64 ± 0.01, which indicates random spatial distribution beneath the source zone in a two-dimensional plane associated with fluid-filled fractures. A slip ratio of about 0.23 reveals that more slip occurred on secondary fault systems in and around the 2001 Bhuj earhquake (<i>Mw</i> 7.6) source zone in KRB.</p>

				<title>Analysis of lineament swarms in a Precambrian metamorphic rocks in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0453-0462</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Addressing the geologic significance of lineaments and their correlation with joints/fractures is still unclear. The present study attempts to analyse the lineament swarms developed in a Precambrian metamorphic terrain in India using both unfiltered and filtered techniques. The unfiltered analysis technique shows that the major lineament and fracture trends are oriented along EW and NS directions respectively, thus failing to provide any correlation between them. The application of domain-based filtering techniques identifies a highly predominant fracture-correlated lineaments in mica schist constituting the EW trending shear zone in the area. This correlation is not evident in the areas north and south of the shear zone, where the lineaments are consistently oriented along the foliation planes of the rocks and are designated as ‘foliation correlated’. The present analysis indicates that the fracture frequency and the strain history may have played significant roles for the formation of fracture-correlated lineaments in the metamorphic terrain.</p>

				<title>Statistical models of interoccurrence times of Iranian earthquakes on the basis of information criteria</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0463-0474</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>By analyzing the seismic catalogue of Iran, the probability distributions of interoccurrence times of earthquakes were investigated for different seismotectonic settings. Several probability distributions were applied to data from major seismotectonic provinces in different cut-off magnitudes and the distribution parameters were determined through the method of maximum likelihood. With the help of goodness-of-fit tests (AIC and BIC criteria based on information theory, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and the coefficient of determination, we have found that the gamma statistics and generalized normal statistics coexist in interoccurrence time statistics. Our results imply that a transition from a generalized normal regime to a gamma regime occurs if the threshold magnitude in certain seismotectonic regions (Alborz–Azarbayejan, Zagros, and Central-East Iran) is changed.</p>

				<title>A study on seismicity and seismic hazard for Karnataka State</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0475-0490</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a detailed study on the seismic pattern of the state of Karnataka and also quantifies the seismic hazard for the entire state. In the present work, historical and instrumental seismicity data for Karnataka (within 300 km from Karnataka political boundary) were compiled and hazard analysis was done based on this data. Geographically, Karnataka forms a part of peninsular India which is tectonically identified as an intraplate region of Indian plate. Due to the convergent movement of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate, movements are occurring along major intraplate faults resulting in seismic activity of the region and hence the hazard assessment of this region is very important. Apart from referring to seismotectonic atlas for identifying faults and fractures, major lineaments in the study area were also mapped using satellite data. The earthquake events reported by various national and international agencies were collected until 2009. Declustering of earthquake events was done to remove foreshocks and aftershocks. Seismic hazard analysis was done for the state of Karnataka using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches incorporating logic tree methodology. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) at rock level was evaluated for the entire state considering a grid size of 0.05&#176; &#215; 0.05&#176;. The attenuation relations proposed for stable continental shield region were used in evaluating the seismic hazard with appropriate weightage factors. Response spectra at rock level for important Tier II cities and Bangalore were evaluated. The contour maps showing the spatial variation of PGA values at bedrock are presented in this work.</p>

				<title>Identifying key processes in the hydrochemistry of a basin through the combined use of factor and regression models</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0491-0507</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An innovative technique of measuring the intensities of major sources of variation in the hydrochemistry of (ground) water in a basin has been developed. This technique, which is based on the combination of R-mode factor and multiple regression analyses, can be used to measure the degrees of influence of the major sources of variation in the hydrochemistry without measuring the concentrations of the entire set of physico-chemical parameters which are often used to characterize water systems. R-mode factor analysis was applied to the data of 13 physico-chemical parameters and 50 samples in order to determine the major sources of variation in the hydrochemistry of some aquifers in the western region of Ghana. In this study, three sources of variation in the hydrochemistry were distinguished: the dissolution of chlorides and sulfates of the major cations, carbonate mineral dissolution, and silicate mineral weathering. Two key parameters were identified with each of the processes and multiple regression models were developed for each process. These models were tested and found to predict these processes quite accurately, and can be applied anywhere within the terrain. This technique can be reliably applied in areas where logistical constraints limit water sampling for whole basin hydrochemical characterization. Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) applied to the data revealed three major groundwater associations distinguished on the basis of the major causes of variation in the hydrochemistry. The three groundwater types represent Na–HCO<sub>3</sub>, Ca–HCO<sub>3</sub>, and Na–Cl groundwater types. Silicate stability diagrams suggest that all these groundwater types are mainly stable in the kaolinite and montmorillonite fields suggesting moderately restricted flow conditions.</p>

				<title>Geochemical characteristics of Mesoproterozoic metabasite dykes from the Chhotanagpur Gneissic Terrain, eastern India: Implications for their emplacement in a plate margin tectonic environment</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0509-0523</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of mafic intrusive bodies (mostly dykes) are exposed in the Chhotanagpur Gneissic Terrain (CGT). Most dykes trend in ENE–WSW to E–W following major structural trends of the region. These metabasite dykes show granoblastic to grano-nematoblastic textures and contain hornblende, plagioclase, chlorite, quartz and epidote which suggest their metamorphism under amphibolite grade P–T conditions. Although no radiometric age is available for the metabasite dykes, field relationships with host rock and available geochronology on granitoids suggest their emplacement during Mesoproterozoic. Geochemical characteristics of these dykes classify them as low-K tholeiite to medium-K calcalkaline type. At least two types of metabasite dykes are recognized on the basis of their HFSE contents; one group shows entirely calc-alkaline nature, whereas the other group has rocks of tholeiite-calc-alkaline series. High Mg&#35;observed in a number of samples indicates their derivation from primary melt. Multielement spidergrams and rare-earth element patterns observed in these samples also corroborate their derivation from different magma batches. Trace element patterns observed for Nb–Ta, Hf–Zr, Sr and Y suggesting involvement of subduction related processes in the genesis of CGT metabasite dykes. Perceived geochemical characteristics suggest that metamorphism did not affect much on the chemistry of metabasites but source region, responsible for the generation of CGT metabasites, was possibly modified during subduction process. This study suggests that magma generated in a destructive plate setting fed the Mesoproterozoic mafic dykes of the CGT.</p>

				<title>Mineral chemistry of Pangidi basalt flows from Andhra Pradesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0525-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper elucidates the compositional studies on clinopyroxene, plagioclase, titaniferous magnetite and ilmenite of basalts of Pangidi area to understand the geothermometry and oxybarometry conditions. Petrographic evidence and anorthite content (up to 85%) of plagioclase and temperature estimates of clinopyroxene indicate that the clinopyroxene is crystallized later than or together with plagioclase. The higher An content indicates that the parent magma is tholeiitic composition. The equilibration temperatures of clinopyroxene (1110–1190&#176;C) and titaniferous magnetite and ilmenite coexisting mineral phases (1063–1103&#176;C) are almost similar in lower basalt flow and it is higher for clinopyroxene (900–1110&#176;C) when compared to titaniferous magnetite and ilmenite coexisting mineral phases (748–898&#176;C) in middle and upper basalt flows. From this it can be inferred that the clinopyroxene is crystallized earlier than Fe–Ti oxide phases reequilibration, which indicates that the clinopyroxene temperature is the approximate eruption temperature of the present lava flows. The wide range of temperatures (900–1190&#176;C) attained by clinopyroxene may point out that the equilibration of clinopyroxene crystals initiated from depth till closer to the surface before the melt erupted. Pangidi basalts follow the QFM buffer curve which indicates the more evolved tholeiitic composition. This suggests the parent tholeiitic magma suffered limited fractionation at high temperature under increasing oxygen fugacity in lower basalt flow and more fractionation at medium to lower temperatures under decreasing oxygen fugacity conditions during cooling of middle and upper basalt flows. The variation of oxygen fugacity indicates the oxidizing conditions for lower basalt flow (9.48–10.3) and extremely reducing conditions for middle (12.1–15.5) and upper basalt (12.4–15.54) flows prevailed at the time of cooling. Temperature <i>vs.</i> (FeO+Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)/(FeO+Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>+MgO) data plots for present basalts suggested the lower basaltic flow is formed at higher temperatures while the middle and upper basalt flows at medium to lower temperatures. The lower basalt flow is represented by higher temperatures which shows high modal values of opaques and glass whereas the medium to lower temperatures of middle and upper flow are caused by vesicular nature which contain larger content of gases and humid to semi-arid conditions during cooling.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The palynostratigraphic data given here are based on the explored borecores (TRBD-2, TRBD-3 and TROD-1), by Geological Survey of India. The Permian strata worked-out is about 1174.00 m thick and comprises from base to top – Talchir, Barakar and Barren Measures formations. The palynological content enables delimitation of five palynological assemblages. (i) <i>Scheuringipollenites barakarensis</i>, (ii) <i>Faunipollenites varius</i>, (iii) <i>Gondisporites raniganjensis</i>, (iv) <i>Densipollenites magnicorpus</i>, and (v) <i>Krempipollenites indicus</i> in ascending order from the subsuface rock strata. The lithologically identified strata Talchir Formation in borecores TRBD-2 and TRBD-3 is palynologically dated late Early Permian in having the <i>Scheuringipollenites barakarensis</i> and the <i>Faunipollenites varius</i> palynozones. Subsequently, the part of Barakar strata in these borecores corroborates with Barakar Formation. In borecore TRBD-3, the Barren Measures rocks do not match with the palynological dates, and are affiliated with the palynoflora of the Raniganj Formation. In TROD-1, the strata identified as Barakar Formation is dated Late Permian in having <i>Gondisporites ranigangensis</i> Palynozone; while that of Barren Measures Formation is palynologically dated Early Triassic having <i>Krempipollenites indicus</i> Palynozone. The palynology has helped in the precise dating of the Lower Gondwana succession of Odari and Bartikhurd blocks in Tatapani–Ramkola Coalfield of South Rewa Gondwana Basin.</p>

				<title>A new atlas of temperature and salinity for the North Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0559-0593</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The most used temperature and salinity climatology for the world ocean, including the Indian Ocean, is the <i>World Ocean Atlas</i> (WOA) (Antonov <i>et al</i> 2006, 2010; Locarnini <i>et al</i> 2006, 2010) because of the vast amount of data used in its preparation. The WOA climatology does not, however, include all the available hydrographic data from the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), leading to the potential for improvement if the data from this region are included to prepare a new climatology. We use all the data that went into the preparation of the WOA (Antonov <i>et al</i> 2010; Locarnini <i>et al</i> 2010), but add considerable data from Indian sources, to prepare new annual, seasonal, and monthly climatologies of temperature and salinity for the Indian Ocean. The addition of data improves the climatology considerably in the Indian EEZ, the differences between the new <i>North Indian Ocean Atlas</i> (NIOA) and WOA being most significant in the Bay of Bengal, where the patchiness seen in WOA, an artifact of the sparsity of data, was eliminated in NIOA. The significance of the new climatology is that it presents a more stable climatological value for the temperature and salinity fields in the Indian EEZ.</p>

				<title>How good are the simulations of tropical SST–rainfall relationship by IPCC AR4 atmospheric and coupled models?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0595-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The failure of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) forced by prescribed SST to simulate and predict the interannual variability of Indian/Asian monsoon has been widely attributed to their inability to reproduce the actual sea surface temperature (SST)–rainfall relationship in the warm Indo-Pacific oceans. This assessment is based on a comparison of the observed and simulated correlation between the rainfall and local SST. However, the observed SSTconvection/rainfall relationship is nonlinear and for this a linear measure such as the correlation is not an appropriate measure. We show that the SST–rainfall relationship simulated by atmospheric and coupled general circulation models in IPCC AR4 is nonlinear, as observed, and realistic over the tropical West Pacific (WPO) and the Indian Ocean (IO). The SST–rainfall pattern simulated by the coupled versions of these models is rather similar to that from the corresponding atmospheric one, except for a shift of the entire pattern to colder/warmer SSTs when there is a cold/warm bias in the coupled version.</p>

				<title>Characteristic features of winter precipitation and its variability over northwest India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0611-0623</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Northwestern parts of India receive considerable amount of precipitation during the winter months of December–March. Although, it is only about 15% of the annual precipitation, the precipitation is very important for rabi crops and to maintain the glaciers extend in the Himalaya, which melt and supply water to the rivers during other seasons. The precipitation is mainly associated with the sequence of synoptic systems known as ‘western disturbances’. The precipitation has considerable spatial and temporal variability, with maximum precipitation occurring particularly over northern hilly regions, with decreasing influence southwards. The spatially coherent winter precipitation series has been prepared for the largest possible area comprising nine meteorological subdivisions of northwest India, which constitute about 32% of the total area of the country, having similar precipitation characteristics. The precipitation series has been statistically analysed to understand its characteristics and variability. The seasonal precipitation series is found to be homogeneous, Gaussian (normal) distributed and free from persistence. The precipitation variability has increased during the most recent three decades with more excess and deficient years.</p>

				<title>Chemical characterisation of meltwater draining from Gangotri Glacier, Garhwal Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0625-0636</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed analytical study of major cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>) and anions (SO$^{2−}_{4}$, HCO$^{−}_{3}$, Cl<sup>−</sup>, NO$^{−}_{3}$) of meltwater draining from Gangotri Glacier was carried out to understand major ion chemistry and to get an insight into geochemical weathering processes controlling hydrochemistry of the glacier. In the meltwater, the abundance order of cations and anions varied as follows: Ca<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Mg<sup>2+</sup> &gt; K<sup>+</sup> &gt; Na<sup>+</sup> and SO$^{2−}_{4}$ &gt; HCO$^{−}_{3}$ &lt; Cl<sup>−</sup> &gt; NO$^{−}_{3}$, respectively. Calcium and magnesium are dominant cations while sulphate and bicarbonate are dominant anions. Weathering of rocks is the dominant mechanism controlling the hydrochemistry of drainage basin. The relative high contribution of (Ca+Mg) to the total cations (TZ<sup>+</sup>), high (Ca+Mg)/(Na+K) ratio (2.63) and low (Na+K)/TZ<sup>+</sup> ratio (0.29) indicate the dominance of carbonate weathering as a major source for dissolved ions in the glacier meltwater. Sulphide oxidation and carbonation are the main proton supplying geochemical reactions controlling the rock weathering in the study area. Statistical analysis was done to identify various factors controlling the dissolved ionic strength of Gangotri Glacier meltwater.</p>

				<title>Impact of climate change on flood characteristics in Brahmaputra basin using a macro-scale distributed hydrological model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0637-0657</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Being the highest specific discharge river system in the world, the Brahmaputra river experiences a number of long-duration flood waves during the monsoon season annually. In order to assess the flood characteristics at the basin and tributary scales, a physically based macro-scale distributed hydrological model (DHM) has been calibrated and validated for 9 wet years. The model performance has been evaluated in terms of prediction of the flood characteristics such as peak discharge, flood duration, arrival time of flood wave, timing of the peak flow and number of flood waves per season. Future changes in the flood wave characteristics of the basin have been evaluated using the validated model with bias-corrected future-projected meteorological scenario from a regional climate model (RCM). Likelihood analysis of the simulated flow time series reveals that significant increase in both peak discharge and flood duration is expected for both the pre-monsoonal and monsoonal seasons in the basin, but the number of flood waves per season would be reduced. Under the projected climate change scenario, it is expected that there will be more catastrophic floods in the basin.</p>

				<title>Geoinformatics for assessing the morphometric control on hydrological response at watershed scale in the Upper Indus Basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0659-0686</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Five watersheds (W1, W2, W3, W4 and W5) in the upper Indus basin were chosen for detailed studies to understand the influences of geomorphology, drainage basin morphometry and vegetation patterns on hydrology. From the morphometric analysis, it is evident that the hydrologic response of these watersheds changes significantly in response to spatial variations in morphometric parameters. Results indicate that W1, W2 and W5 contribute higher surface runoff than W3 and W4. Further, the topographic and land cover analyses reveal that W1, W2 and W5 generate quick runoff that may result in flooding over prolonged rainy spells. A physically based semi-distributed hydrologic model (soil and water assessment tool, SWAT) was used for simulating the hydrological response from the watersheds. As per the simulations, W5 watershed produces the highest runoff of 11.17 mm/year followed by W1 (7.9 mm/year), W2 (6.6 mm/year), W4 (5.33 mm/year) and W3 (4.29 mm/year). Thus, W5 is particularly more vulnerable to flooding during high rain spells followed by W1, W2, W4 and W3, respectively. Synthetic unit hydrograph analysis of the five watersheds also reveals high peak discharge for W5. The simulated results on the hydrological response from the five watersheds are quite in agreement with those of the morphometric, topographic, vegetation and unit hydrograph analyses. Therefore, it is quite evident that these factors have significant impact on the hydrological response from the watersheds and can be used to predict flood peaks, sediment yield and water discharge from the ungauged watersheds.</p>

				<title>Optimising view angles for the estimation of leaf area index via entropy-difference analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0687-0695</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is important to evaluate the information content of remote sensing data in order to synthetically use multi-source remote sensing data to improve the accuracy and consistency of land surface parameter retrieval. This paper presents a technique for information content evaluation of multi-spectral/angular remote sensing data for the leaf area index (LAI) inversion, the method of entropy-difference analysis.The proposed method is based on a numerical evaluation of the entropy of the observed dataset to learn how much variation in observation is caused by the variation in LAI. The relationship between remote sensing information and the LAI inversion accuracy is validated based on the model-simulated canopy reflectance data and the experiment data. We make the following observation: the larger the entropydifference for canopy reflectance data, the higher the LAI inversion accuracy. That is, choosing a good combination of observation angles is sometimes more important than simply increasing the number of observations. The presented technique may be useful in designing and evaluating quantitative remote sensing algorithms and products.</p>

				<title>Seasonal variability in aerosol optical and physical characteristics estimated using the application of the Ängström formula over Mohal in the northwestern Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0697-0710</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Investigations of aerosol optical and physical characteristics using the application of Ängström formula and second order polynomial fit were carried out from April 2006 to March 2009 at Mohal in the Kullu valley. The measurements of spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) were conducted using multiwavelength radiometer (MWR). The AOD at 0.5 𝜇 m wavelength on daily basis (mean ± standard deviation) for the entire three-year study period is obtained as 0.24 ± 0.08. Seasonal variations show the highest AOD at 0.5 𝜇 m wavelength with ∼0.34 ± 0.08 during pre-monsoon (April–July), followed by ∼0.26 ± 0.08 during monsoon (August–September), ∼0.21 ± 0.05 during post-monsoon (October–November) and ∼0.20 ± 0.07 during winter (December–March). The seasonal values indicate that the AOD at 0.5 𝜇 m wavelength is decreasing from pre-monsoon to winter with a notable reduction around 41%. The Ängström parameters using least square method is not found appropriate for size distribution particularly when coarse mode aerosols dominate. The coefficients of second order polynomial fit are more appropriate for the discrimination of aerosol size or irrespective to the dominance of either of the aerosols size. The difference in coefficient of polynomial fit is used to get confirmation on the dominant mode during different seasons. Study reveals that about 93%, 72% and 59% of AOD spectra are dominated by a wide range of fine mode fractions or mixture of modes during post-monsoon, winter and monsoon, respectively. On the other hand, during pre-monsoon, 72% of AOD spectra are found to be dominated by coarse mode aerosols.</p>

				<page>0711-0722</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents the nature of annual cycles of tropospheric ozone, cloud occurrences, NO<sub>2</sub>, rainfall, SO<sub>2</sub>, SPM, CO, non-methane hydrocarbon and surface solar radiation for the period October 2004 to June 2009 over Alipore (22.52&#176;N, 88.33&#176;E), India. Annual cycle of low-level cloud occurrences depicts that the low-level cloud over Alipore had been noticed to occur for many days and nights, particularly from June to September. The low-level cloud occurrences were found in winter months and post-monsoon period. The effect of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone concentration has been critically analysed and explained. It has been observed that the concentration of ozone is oscillatory with cloud occurrences and has a slight linear decreasing trend with the increase of cloud occurrences and vice versa. The concentration of tropospheric ozone attained higher value at moderate cloud occurrences and comparatively lower value at both of the lower and higher cloud occurrences. The related possible chemical and physical explanation for role of cloud occurrences on tropospheric ozone has been offered.</p>

					<p>Vertical electrical resistivity soundings (VES) were carried out over four major dykes of Nandurbar district in the northern Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) of Maharashtra to investigate the subsurface geological conditions, with an aim of identifying zones with groundwater resource potential. Dykes can act as pathways or barrier to the groundwater flow depending upon the intensity of fracturing in the dyke rock. Whether the dykes act as water conduits or as barriers depends on their structure, location and orientation with respect to the groundwater flow. The Nandurbar district is known for occurrence of dykes and dyke swarms. A total of 33 dykes were demarcated in the study region and four major dykes (D4, D5, D6, and D7) from these were chosen for detailed VES studies. Data were acquired over these four dykes during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods to observe the seasonal variation in groundwater movement. These studies revealed changes in field characters, their attitudes, thickness and structure of the dykes. Longitudinal geoelectrical sections along these dykes demonstrated carrier as well as barrier stretches which identified potential aquifers up to depths of 25–30m below which hard and compact rock exists. These studies also indicated that dykes with sufficient width, length and favourable hydrogeological structure form potential aquifers for the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the study area.</p>

				<title>Diagenesis of Holocene reef and associated beachrock of certain coral islands, Gulf of Mannar, India: Implication on climate and sea level</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0733-0745</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The reef and associated beachrock from certain Gulf of Mannar islands (Rameswaram, Kurusadai, Shingle and Appa Island) were studied to assess the diagenetic evidences. Sixty samples were collected from marine terraces and reef platforms. The samples comprised of coral rubbles, shell fragments and lithic fractions. The presence of corals in the form of framework or isolated patches on the reef flat suggests the rapid increase of accommodation and probably absence of terrigenous and siliciclastic inputs. Moreover, the massive coral heads above the transgressive phase suggest the maximum flooding and relatively deepest facies. The freshwater dissolution, association of marine and meteoric cements suggest the semiarid climatic condition with marine diagenesis during sea level lowstands and recharge of freshwater lenses during periodic rainfalls. In addition, the interaction of these mixed carbonate, siliciclastic sediments results in silicification of carbonate components. The reef associated beachrock were deposited in low energy environment with some amount of terrigenous matters derived from Precambrian basement rocks and transported into reef area by ephemeral streams and longshore sediment transport. The incorporation of coral fragments within the siliciclastic sediments are most probably due to the erosion and re-deposition of the sediments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present study reports occurrence of helically coiled microfossil <i>Obruchevella</i> Reitlinger from the Owk Shale of the Kurnool Group from the peninsular India. The age of the Kurnool Group is poorly constrained due to the absence of direct radiometric dating and meager palaeobiological data. Occurrence of <i>Obruchevella</i> is considered as a typical Vendian marker genus recorded mostly from close to the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary successions. Hence, the present assemblage is important to ascertain the age of the basin. In the Owk Shale, four species of <i>Obruchevella</i>, viz., <i>O. delicata, O. parva, O. minor</i> and <i>O. valdaica</i> are recorded as organic walled microfossils. Among them <i>O. valdaica</i> is the largest in terms of size parameters. On the global scale, the recovered species occur in the Late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian sediments. Therefore, the occurrence of microfossil <i>Obruchevella</i> in the Owk Shale and known burrow structures in the Narji Limestone suggest Ediacaran age close to the Cambrian for the Kurnool Basin and challenges the recently assigned esoproterozoic age of the basin.</p>

				<title>Lime muds and their genesis off-Northwestern India during the late Quaternary</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0769-0779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two sediment types were found in five gravity cores collected from water depths between 56 m and 121 m along the northwestern continental margin of India: lime muds were abundant in the lower section while siliciclastic sediments dominated the upper section. Lime mud-dominated sediments in shelf cores contained 60%–75% carbonate, 0.3%–0.6% Sr and terrigenous minerals, whereas those at the shelf break were found to have &lt; 90% carbonate, 0.6%–0.8% Sr and traces of terrigenous minerals. Aragonite needles showing blunt edges, jointed needles and needles wrapped in smooth aragonite cement were found to be common. Stable (O and C) isotopes of lime mud indicate a potentially freshwater contribution for shelf cores and purely marine contribution for those at the shelf break. Calibrated radiocarbon ages of the lime muds ranged from 17.6–11.9 ka in different cores. The results reported here suggest that the lime muds in the shallow shelf are probably reworked from the Gulf of Kachchh, whereas those at the shelf break were biodetrital, initially formed on the carbonate platform during low stands of sea level and then exported. The change in lime mud-dominated to siliciclastic-dominated sediments in the cores may be due to climate change and rapid rise in sea level during the early Holocene.</p>

				<title>Provenance of the Late Neogene Siwalik sandstone, Kumaun Himalayan Foreland Basin: Constraints from the metamorphic rank and index of detrital rock fragments</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0781-0792</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An understanding about lithology, tectonics and unroofing history of provenance is mostly drawn from the compositional and textural parameters of the detrital fragments. We here use different metamorphic ranks (Rm) and metamorphic index (MI) values of rock fragments present in Late Neogene Siwalik sandstone of the Ramganga sub-basin to infer the provenance history. The study indicates maximum contribution from metamorphic ranks 1 and 2 (Rm1 and Rm2; meta-sedimentary and very low grade metamorphic rocks) and minimum from metamorphic rank 4 (Rm4; high metamorphic grade rocks). The metamorphic index (MI) values range from 118 to 224, with an average of 186. The meta-sedimentary and very low-grade metamorphic rock fragments are derived from the Lesser Himalayan domain. The medium-to-high grade metamorphic fragments are derived from the Lesser Himalayan Crystalline bodies. The abundance of Rm2 and Rm3 detrital modes suggest the exhumation of crystalline bodies of the Ramgarh and Almora most likely occurred prior to 7 Ma and subsequently the source area shifted and resulted abundant supply of Rm1 fragments due to the upliftment along Main Boundary Thrust around 5.55 Ma.</p>

				<title>Petrology, geochemistry of hornblende gabbro and associated dolerite dyke of Paharpur, Puruliya, West Bengal: Implication for petrogenetic process and tectonic setting</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0793-0812</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Paharpur gabbroic intrusive is an arcuate body running east–west paralleling the foliation of Chhotanagpur Granite Gneiss which acts as country rock. The main gabbroic body is intruded by a number of dolerite dykes running north–south. It is composed of clinopyroxene (Wo<sub>48</sub>En<sub>40</sub>Fs<sub>12</sub>–Wo<sub>51</sub>En<sub>40</sub>Fs<sub>09</sub>, mg no. 72–82), plagioclase (An<sub>52</sub>–An<sub>90</sub>), hornblende (magnesian hornblende to ferro-tschermackite), orthopyroxene (En<sub>76</sub>–En<sub>79</sub>) and ilmenite. Hornblende occurs as large poikilitic grain and constitutes around 60% of the rock. Both gabbro and associated dolerite dykes, show relatively primitive character (mg no. 65–73). Primitive mantle-normalized and MORB-normalized spider diagrams indicate enrichment in Rb, Ba, Th, La, Sr and depletion in Nb, Zr, Y, Ti and Nd. The LILE enrichment and Nb, Ti, Zr, Y depletion suggest arc like geochemical signature for the gabbroic and doleritic rocks of Paharpur. Flat to slightly LREE fractionated pattern and variable degree of REE enrichment is observed. An early stage fractionation of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, orthopyroxene, ilmenite and late stage reaction of cumulate pile and evolved melt/hydrous fluid is suggested for magmatic evolution of gabbro. Associated dolerite dykes, which are geochemically similar to the gabbro, have tholeiitic with boninitic character. The mineralogical and chemical compositions of intrusive rocks also have some similarity with mafic rocks of ophiolite complex of subduction zone.</p>

				<title>Gravity anomalies, crustal structure and rift tectonics at the Konkan and Kerala basins, western continental margin of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0813-0822</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Litho-stratigraphic variation of sedimentary units constructed from seismic sections and gravity anomaly in the Konkan and Kerala basins of the western continental margin of India (WCMI) have been used to model processes such as lithospheric rifting mechanism, its strength, and evolution of flank uplift topography that led to the present-day Western Ghats escarpment. Based on the process-oriented approach, two lithospheric models (necking and magmatic underplating) of evolution of the margin were tested. Both, necking and underplating models suggest an effective elastic thickness (Te) of 5 km and 10 km along Konkan and Kerala basins, respectively and a deep level of necking at 20 km at both basins. Model study suggests that the necking model better explains the observed gravity anomalies in the southern part of the WCMI. A synthesis of these results along with the previously published elastic thickness estimates along the WCMI suggests that a low-to-intermediate strength lithosphere and a deeper level of necking explains the observed flank-uplift opography of the Western Ghats. Process-oriented gravity modeling further suggests that the lateral variations in the lithospheric strength, though not very significant, exist from north to south within a distance of 600 km in the Konkan and Kerala basins along the WCMI at the time of rifting. A comparison with previous Te estimates from coherence analysis along the WCMI indicates that the lithospheric strength did not change appreciably since the time of rifting and it is low both onshore and offshore having a range of 5–15 km.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>As the number of Earth geopotential models (EGM) grows with the increasing number of data collected by dedicated satellite gravity missions, CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE, measuring the differences among the models and monitoring the improvements in gravity field recovery are required. This study assesses the performance of recent EGMs derived from CHAMP, GRACE, and other data in comparison to the earlier two models in Turkish territory. Also the improvement capacities of these EGMs using local terrestrial data are inspected with two different approaches. In the first approach, the spherical harmonic coefficients of EGMs are modified depending on the local gravity data. In the second part, the original EGMs with their maximum harmonic expansions are employed in Remove Compute Restore algorithm for high resolution local geoid modelling. The assessment results with the local terrestrial data exhibited large disagreements among the models in Turkey. The outputs from regional improvements of EGMs using the gravity observations clarified the important role of the ground truth data contribution in geopotential models. The validations of the computed high resolution geoids rely on the EGMs at the GNSS/levelling networks, having 451 and 309 benchmarks, provided an absolute accuracy by means of standard deviations of the geoid height differences around 20 cm. These results from the final stage of the case study provide a comparison among the EGMs by means of their fit to the local gravity field.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Narmada South Fault in the Indian peninsular shield region is associated with moderate-to-strong earthquakes. The prevailing hazard evidenced by the earthquake-related fatalities in the region imparts significance to the investigations of the seismogenic environment. In the present study, the prevailing seismotectonic conditions specified by parameters associated with source, path and site conditions are appraised. Stochastic finite-fault models are formulated for each scenario earthquake. The simulated peak ground accelerations for the rock sites from the possible mean maximum earthquake of magnitude $M_W$ 6.8 goes as high as 0.24 g while fault-rupture of magnitude $M_W$ 7.1 exhibits a maximum peak ground acceleration of 0.36 g. The results suggest that present hazard specification of Bureau of Indian Standards as inadequate. The present study is expected to facilitate development of ground motion models for deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis of the region.</p>

				<title>Detection of Mg spinel lithologies on central peak of crater Theophilus using Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<sup>3</sup>) data from Chandrayaan-1</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0847-0853</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral reflectance data derived from Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<sup>3</sup>) onboard India’s Chandrayaan-1 has revealed Fe bearing Mg-spinel-rich lithology on central peaks of the crater Theophilus. These newly identified Fe bearing Mg-spinel-rich rock types are defined by their strong 2-𝜇m absorption and lack of 1-𝜇m absorptions in spectral reflectance response. Such lithology has been reported previously along the inner ring of Moscoviense Basin on the lunar far side. The Modified Gaussian Modeling (MGM) analysis of the Fe bearing Mg-spinel reflectance spectra has been done and the results of the analysis clearly bring out a strong spectral absorption at 1872 nm with no significant absortion around 1000 nm. The presence of spinel group of minerals in the Theophilus central peak and the fact that central peaks mostly represent uplifted mass of deep crustal material confirm that central peaks can be used as a window to study the deep crustal and/or upper mantle composition and may lead to a fresh perspective about the crustal composition of Moon.</p>

				<title>Monitoring of Gangotri glacier using remote sensing and ground observations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0855-0866</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, Gangotri glacier was monitored using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS-III sensor data in combination with field collected snow-meteorological data for a period of seven years (2001–2008). An overall decreasing trend in the areal extent of seasonal snow cover area (SCA) was observed. An upward shifting trend of wet snow line was observed in the beginning of melt period, i.e., in May and dominant wet snow conditions were observed between May and October. Snow meteorological parameters collected in the Gangotri sub-basin suggest reduction in fresh snowfall amount during winter, increase in rainfall amount during summer, decrease in snowfall days, increase in rainfall days and rising trend of average temperature. The prevailing wet snow condition on glacier has caused scouring of slopes which led the excessive soil/debris deposition on the glacier surface. This was observed as one of the major factor for activating fast melting and affecting the glacier health significantly. Apart from climatic conditions, terrain factors were observed for changing the glacio-morphology. The significant changes on the glacier surface were observed in the regions of abrupt slope change. The above factors affecting the Gangotri glacier health were also validated using high resolution satellite imageries and field visit. A deglaciation of 6% in overall area of Gangotri glacier was observed between the years 1962 and 2006.</p>

				<title>Monsoon sensitivity to aerosol direct radiative forcing in the community atmosphere model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0867-0889</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Aerosol forcing remains a dominant uncertainty in climate studies. The impact of aerosol direct radiative forcing on Indian monsoon is extremely complex and is strongly dependent on the model, aerosol distribution and characteristics specified in the model, modelling strategy employed as well as on spatial and temporal scales. The present study investigates (i) the aerosol direct radiative forcing impact on mean Indian summer monsoon when a combination of quasi-realistic mean annual cycles of scattering and absorbing aerosols derived from an aerosol transport model constrained with satellite observed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is prescribed, (ii) the dominant feedback mechanism behind the simulated impact of all-aerosol direct radiative forcing on monsoon and (iii) the relative impacts of absorbing and scattering aerosols on mean Indian summer monsoon. We have used CAM3, an atmospheric GCM (AGCM) that has a comprehensive treatment of the aerosol–radiation interaction. This AGCM has been used to perform climate simulations with three different representations of aerosol direct radiative forcing due to the total, scattering aerosols and black carbon aerosols. We have also conducted experiments without any aerosol forcing. Aerosol direct impact due to scattering aerosols causes significant reduction in summer monsoon precipitation over India with a tendency for southward shift of Tropical Convergence Zones (TCZs) over the Indian region. Aerosol forcing reduces surface solar absorption over the primary rainbelt region of India and reduces the surface and lower tropospheric temperatures. Concurrent warming of the lower atmosphere over the warm oceanic region in the south reduces the land–ocean temperature contrast and weakens the monsoon overturning circulation and the advection of moisture into the landmass. This increases atmospheric convective stability, and decreases convection, clouds, precipitation and associated latent heat release. Our analysis reveals a defining negative moisture-advection feedback that acts as an internal damping mechanism spinning down the regional hydrological cycle and leading to significant circulation changes in response to external radiative forcing perturbations. When total aerosol loading (both absorbing and scattering aerosols) is prescribed, dust and black carbon aerosols are found to cause significant atmospheric heating over the monsoon region but the aerosol-induced weakening of meridional lower tropospheric temperature gradient (leading to weaker summer monsoon rainfall) more than offsets the increase in summer-time rainfall resulting from the atmospheric heating effect of absorbing aerosols, leading to a net decrease of summer monsoon rainfall. Further, we have carried out climate simulations with globally constant AODs and also with the constant AODs over the extended Indian region replaced by realistic AODs. Regional aerosol radiative forcing perturbations over the Indian region is found to have impact not only over the region of loading but over remote tropical regions as well. This warrants the need to prescribe realistic aerosol properties in strategic regions such as India in order to accurately assess the aerosol impact.</p>

				<title>An artificial neural network based fast radiative transfer model for simulating infrared sounder radiances</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0891-0901</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The first step in developing any algorithm to retrieve the atmospheric temperature and humidity parameters at various pressure levels is the simulation of the top of the atmosphere radiances that can be measured by the satellite. This study reports the results of radiative transfer simulations for the multichannel infrared sounder of the proposed Indian satellite INSAT-3D due to be launched shortly. Here, the widely used community software k Compressed Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Algorithm (kCARTA) is employed for performing the radiative transfer simulations. Though well established and benchmarked, kCARTA is a line-by-line solver and hence takes enormous computational time and effort for simulating the multispectral radiances for a given atmospheric scene. This necessitates the development of a much faster and at the same time, equally accurate RT model that can drive a real-time retrieval algorithm. In the present study, a fast radiative transfer model using neural networks is proposed to simulate radiances corresponding to the wavenumbers of INSAT-3D. Realistic atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles have been used for training the network. Spectral response functions of GOES-13, a satellite similar in construction, purpose and design and already in use are used. The fast RT model is able to simulate the radiances for 1200 profiles in 18 ms for a 15-channel GOES profile, with a correlation coefficient of over 99%. Finally, the robustness of the model is tested using additional synthetic profiles generated using empirical orthogonal functions (EOF).</p>

				<title>Carbon dioxide and water vapour characteristics on the west coast of Arabian Sea during Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0903-0910</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbon dioxide, water vapour, air temperature and wind measurements at 10 Hz sampling rate were carried out over the coast of Arabian Sea, Goa (15&#176;21&#8242;N, 73&#176; 51&#8242;E) in India. These observations were collected, in association with the surface layer turbulent parameters for the Arabian Sea  Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX). In the summer monsoon period, concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was in the range of 550–790 mg m<sup>−3</sup> whereas the water vapour was in the range of 17.5–24.5 g m<sup>−3</sup>. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis has been performed on these observations to investigate the spectral behaviour of CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour. The relation between CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour on various atmospheric scales has been proposed. CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour observations confirmed the existence of periodicities of large (11, 8 days), meso (5 days) and micrometeorological (20 min) scales.</p>

				<title>Influences of the boundary layer evolution on surface ozone variations at a tropical rural site in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0911-0922</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Collocated measurements of the boundary layer evolution and surface ozone, made for the first time at a tropical rural site (Gadanki 13.5&#176;N, 79.2&#176;E, 375 m amsl) in India, are presented here. The boundary layer related observations were made utilizing a lower atmospheric wind profiler and surface ozone observations were made using a UV analyzer simultaneously in April month. Daytime average boundary layer height varied from 1.5 km (on a rainy day) to a maximum of 2.5 km (on a sunny day). Correlated day-to-day variability in the daytime boundary layer height and ozone mixing ratios is observed. Days of higher ozone mixing ratios are associated with the higher boundary layer height and <i>vice versa</i>. It is shown that higher height of the boundary layer can lead to the mixing of near surface air with the ozone rich air aloft, resulting in the observed enhancements in surface ozone. A chemical box model simulation indicates about 17% reduction in the daytime ozone levels during the conditions of suppressed PBL in comparison with those of higher PBL conditions. On a few occasions, substantially elevated ozone levels (as high as 90 ppbv) were observed during late evening hours, when photochemistry is not intense. These events are shown to be due to southwesterly wind with uplifting and northeasterly winds with downward motions bringing ozone rich air from nearby urban centers. This was further corroborated by backward trajectory simulations.</p>

				<title>Sensitivity of tropical cyclone Jal simulations to physics parameterizations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0923-0946</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the sensitivity of numerical simulations of tropical cyclones to physics parameterizations is carried out with a view to determine the best set of physics options for prediction of cyclones originating in the north Indian Ocean. For this purpose, the tropical cyclone Jal has been simulated by the advanced (or state of science) mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model on a desktop mini super computer CRAY CX1 with the available physics parameterizations. The model domain consists of one coarse and two nested domains. The resolution of the coarse domain is 90 km while the two nested domains have resolutions of 30 and 10 km, respectively. The results from the inner most domain have been considered for analyzing and comparing the results. Model simulation fields are compared with corresponding analysis or observation data. The track and intensity of simulated cyclone are compared with best track estimates provided by the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) data. Two sets of experiments are conducted to determine the best combination of physics schemes for track and intensity and it is seen that the best set of physics combination for track is not suitable for intensity prediction and the best combination for track prediction overpredicts the intensity of the cyclone. The sensitivity of the results to orography and level of nesting has also been studied. Simulations were also done for the cyclone Aila with (i) best set of physics and (ii) randomly selected physics schemes. The results of the Aila case show that the best set of physics schemes has more prediction skill than the randomly selected schemes in the case of track prediction. The cumulus (CPS), planetary boundary layer (PBL) and microphysics (MP) parameterization schemes have more impact on the track and intensity prediction skill than the other parameterizations employed in the mesoscale model.</p>

				<title>Nature of light rain during presence and absence of bright band</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0947-0961</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the evolution of rain drop size distribution (DSD) during bright band (BB) and no-BB (NBB) conditions of low intensity rainfall events as observed by a vertically pointing Micro Rain Radar (MRR) over Pune (18.58&#176;N, 73.92&#176;E), India. The BB is identified by enhanced radar reflectivity factor 𝑍 (dBZ) at the 0&#176;C isotherm. The gradient of hydrometeor fall velocity is found to be a good indicator in identifying the melting layer when enhanced radar reflectivity at melting layer is not prominent. The storm structures as observed by the MRR are compared with CloudSat observations that provide evidence of ice hydrometeor at ∼−60&#176;C with clear indication of BB at 0&#176;C. Storm heights at warmer than 0&#176;C are evident during NBB conditions from CloudSat. This suggests that warm rain processes are responsible for producing rain during NBB conditions. During BB conditions, bimodal DSDs below the melting layer are observed at lower altitudes. The DSDs of shallow warm precipitating systems of NBB conditions are monomodal at all the altitudes. Significantly, normalized DSDs are found to be bimodal for BB conditions, and monomodal for NBB conditions which confirm different dominant microphysical processes. It is found that the observed bimodal DSDs during BB conditions are mainly due to the collision, coalescence and break-up processes. During NBB conditions, number and size of large raindrops grow while reaching the ground without much breakup. The radar reflectivity and rainfall intensity 𝑅 ($mmh^{−1}$) relationship of the form 𝑍 = $aR^b$ are found out for BB and NBB conditions. Existing different microphysical processes lead to large coefficient in the $Z–R$ relationship with small exponent during BB conditions while during NBB conditions the coefficients are small with large exponents.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric water budget over the western Himalayas in a regional climate model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0963-0973</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During winter months (December, January, February – DJF), the western Himalayas (WH) receive precipitation from eastward moving extratropical cyclones, called western disturbances (WDs) in Indian parlance. Winter precipitation–moisture convergence–evaporation (P–C–E) cycle is analyzed for a period of 22 years (1981–2002: 1980(D)–1981(J, F) to 2001(D)–2002(J, F)) with observed and modelled (RegCM3) climatological estimates over WH. Remarkable model skills have been observed in depicting the hydrological cycle over WH. Although precipitation biases exist, similar spatial precipitation with well marked two maxima is simulated by the model. As season advances, temporal distribution shows higher precipitation in simulation than the observed. However, P–C–E cycle shows similar peaks of moisture convergence and evaporation in daily climatologies though with varying maxima/minima. In the first half of winter, evaporation over WH is mainly driven by ground surface and 2 m air temperature. Lowest temperatures during mid-winter correspond to lowest evaporation to precipitation ratio as well.</p>

				<page>0975-0987</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper utilizes wind speed data measured at 3 and 10 m above water surface level using buoys at 10 stations in Ionian and Aegean Seas to understand the behaviour of wind and thereafter energy yield at these stations using 5 MW rated power offshore wind turbine. With wind power densities of 971 and 693 W/m<sup>2</sup> at 50 m above water surface level, Mykonos and Lesvos were found to be superb and outstanding windy sites with wind class of 7 and 6, respectively. Other locations like Athos, Santorini and Skyros with wind power density of more than 530 W/m<sup>2</sup> and wind class of 5 were found to be the excellent sites. Around 15–16% higher winds were observed at 10 m compared to that at 3 m. Lower values of wind speed were found during summer months and higher during winter time in most of the cases reported in the present work. Slightly decreasing (∼2% per year) linear trends were observed in annual mean wind speed at Lesvos and Santorini. These trends need to be verified with more data from buoys or from nearby onshore meteorological stations. At Athos and Mykonos, increasing linear trends were estimated. At all the stations the chosen wind turbine could produce energy for more than 70% of the time. The wind speed distribution was found to be well represented by Weibull parameters obtained using Maximum likelihood method compared to WAsP and Method of Moments.</p>

				<title>Calibration of regional ionospheric delay with uncombined precise point positioning and accuracy assessment</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0989-0999</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new method for the calibration of regional ionospheric delay based on uncombined precise point positioning (U-PPP) is proposed in this study. The performance of the new method was comparatively validated in terms of its accuracy and robustness with respect to the phase-smoothed pseudorange (PSP) method through two short-baseline experiments. Accuracy of the PPP-derived ionospheric delays was further assessed by interpolating them to a user station to perform single-frequency simulated kinematic PPP. Two 24-hr period datasets of four continuous operation reference system (CORS) stations were analyzed, collected during calm and disturbed ionospheric conditions, respectively. The single-frequency GPS observables from a user station, that were <i>a-priori</i> corrected by the interpolated ionospheric delays, were utilized to implement single-frequency PPP (SF-PPP). The results show that interpolation accuracy is better than 1 dm and, with the proposed method, is less affected by the ionospheric activity; meanwhile, positioning accuracy of SF-PPP was 4 ∼5 cm (horizontal) and better than 1 dm (vertical). For comparison, two reference SF-PPP solutions were also obtained, in which the ionospheric delays are eliminated either by forming semi-combination observations or by using global ionosphere maps (GIM) model values; in both cases the positioning accuracy was only 4 ∼7 dm (horizontal) and 1 m (vertical). These results provide a further demonstration of the performance of PPP-based regional ionospheric calibration in the parameter domain.</p>

				<title>Study of ionospheric anomalies due to impact of typhoon using Principal Component Analysis and image processing</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1001-1010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and image processing are used to determine Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies in the F-layer of the ionosphere relating to Typhoon Nakri for 29 May, 2008 (UTC). PCA and image processing are applied to the global ionospheric map (GIM) with transforms conducted for the time period 12:00–14:00 UT on 29 May, 2008 when the wind was most intense. Results show that at a height of approximately 150–200 km the TEC anomaly is highly localized; however, it becomes more intense and widespread with height. Potential causes of these results are discussed with emphasis given to acoustic gravity waves caused by wind force.</p>

				<title>Modelling and analyzing the watershed dynamics using Cellular Automata (CA)– Markov model – A geo-information based approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1011-1024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Improper practices of land use and land cover (LULC) including deforestation, expansion of agriculture and infrastructure development are deteriorating watershed conditions. Here, we have utilized remote sensing and GIS tools to study LULC dynamics using <i>Cellular Automata (CA)–Markov</i> model and predicted the future LULC scenario, in terms of magnitude and direction, based on past trend in a hydrological unit, Choudwar watershed, India. By analyzing the LULC pattern during 1972, 1990, 1999 and 2005 using satellite-derived maps, we observed that the biophysical and socio-economic drivers including residential/industrial development, road–rail and settlement proximity have influenced the spatial pattern of the watershed LULC, leading to an accretive linear growth of agricultural and settlement areas. The annual rate of increase from 1972 to 2004 in agriculture land, settlement was observed to be 181.96, 9.89 ha/year, respectively, while decrease in forest, wetland and marshy land were 91.22, 27.56 and 39.52 ha/year, respectively. Transition probability and transition area matrix derived using inputs of (i) residential/industrial development and (ii) proximity to transportation network as the major causes. The predicted LULC scenario for the year 2014, with reasonably good accuracy would provide useful inputs to the LULC planners for effective management of the watershed. The study is a maiden attempt that revealed agricultural expansion is the main driving force for loss of forest, wetland and marshy land in the Choudwar watershed and has the potential to continue in future. The forest in lower slopes has been converted to agricultural land and may soon take a call on forests occurring on higher slopes. Our study utilizes three time period changes to better account for the trend and the modelling exercise; thereby advocates for better agricultural practices with additional energy subsidy to arrest further forest loss and LULC alternations.</p>

				<title>Gravimetric geoid of a part of south India and its comparison with global geopotential models and GPS-levelling data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1025-1032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Precise information of geoid undulations is essential for obtaining the orthometric heights from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements over any region; apart from providing the information of subsurface density distribution. This paper presents computation of geoid undulations over a part of southern Indian region from terrestrial gravity and elevation data using remove–restore technique that involves spherical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute ‘Stokes’ coefficients. Computed geoid undulations are compared with geoid obtained from global geopotential models such as EGM2008 and EIGENGRACE02S and measured GPS-levelling records at 67 locations. Statistical analysis of comparison suggests that the computed gravimetric geoid model has a good match with the geoid determined from GPS-levelling with rms of 0.1 m whereas EGM2008 has 0.46 m. The differences of GPS-levelling with EGM2008 at majority of stations fall in the range of ± 0.5 m, which indicates that EGM2008 may be used for orthometric height determination with an accuracy of &gt; 0.5 m in the south Indian region and offers a reasonably good transformation platform from ellipsoid to local datum. However, local determination of geoid is necessary for better accuracy of orthometric height from GPS. The gravimetric geoid calculated from the available gravity data shows considerable improvement to the global model and can be used to achieve orthometric height with an accuracy of 0.1 m.</p>

				<title>Multifractal analysis of earthquakes in Kumaun Himalaya and its surrounding region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1033-1047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Himalayan seismicity is related to continuing northward convergence of Indian plate against Eurasian plate. Earthquakes in this region are mainly caused due to release of elastic strain energy. The Himalayan region can be attributed to highly complex geodynamic process and therefore is best suited for multifractal seismicity analysis. Fractal analysis of earthquakes (mb &#8805; 3.5) occurred during 1973–2008 led to the detection of a clustering pattern in the narrow time span. This clustering was identified in three windows of 50 events each having low spatial correlation fractal dimension ($D_C$) value 0.836, 0.946 and 0.285 which were mainly during the span of 1998 to 2005. This clustering may be considered as an indication of a highly stressed region. The Guttenberg Richter 𝑏-value was determined for the same subsets considered for the $D_C$ estimation. Based on the fractal clustering pattern of events, we conclude that the clustered events are indicative of a highly stressed region of weak zone from where the rupture propagation eventually may nucleate as a strong earthquake. Multifractal analysis gave some understanding of the heterogeneity of fractal structure of the seismicity and existence of complex interconnected structure of the Himalayan thrust systems. The present analysis indicates an impending strong earthquake, which might help in better hazard mitigation for the Kumaun Himalaya and its surrounding region.</p>

				<title>Mapping hydrothermal altered mineral deposits using Landsat 7 ETM+ image in and around Kuju volcano, Kyushu, Japan</title>

				<page>1049-1057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To evaluate the conventional methods for mapping hydrothermal altered deposits by using Landsat 7 ETM+ image in and around Kuju volcano is the prime target of our study. The Kuju volcano is a mountainous composite which consists of hornblende-andesite lava domes and associated lava flows. We used the colour composite, band ratio, principal component analysis, least square fitting and reference spectra analysis methods. The colour composite and band ratio methods showed very clearly the hydrothermal altered deposits of clay minerals, iron oxides and ferric oxides around the fumaroles. The principal component analysis using the Crosta technique also enabled us to represent undoubtedly the altered hydroxyl and iron-oxide mineral deposits of this region concentrating around the fumaroles. Least square fitting method illustrated the goethite, hematite and clay alteration region. Finally the target detection method for reference spectral analysis by using ENVI 4.3 detected the representative hydrothermal altered minerals around Kuju volcano fumaroles area. Therefore, all the methods showed high efficiency for mapping hydrothermal altered deposits especially iron-oxide minerals such as hematite, goethite and jarosite, which are alteration products of hydrothermal sulfides around the fumaroles.</p>

				<title>Deciphering heavy metal contamination zones in soils of a granitic terrain of southern India using factor analysis and GIS</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1059-1070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soil contamination by heavy metals has been a major concern for last few decades due to increase in urbanization and industrialization. The main objective of this research was to identify the heavy metal contaminated zones in the study area. Twenty five soil samples collected throughout the agriculture, residential and industrial areas were analysed by X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF) for trace metals and major oxides. These metals can affect the quality of soil and infiltrate through the soil, thereby causing groundwater pollution. Based on the chemical analysis of major oxides (SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and their distribution; it is observed that these soils are predominantly siliceous type with slight enrichment of alumina component in the study area. Correlation matrix (CM) and factor analysis (FA) is employed to the heavy metal variables, viz., Ba, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sr, V, Y, Zn and Zr of the soil to determine the dominant factors contributing to the soil contamination in the area. In the analysis, five factors emerged as significant contributors to the soil quality. The total contribution of these five factors is about 90%. The contribution of the first factor is about 45% and has significant positive loadings of Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. The contribution of second factor is 22% and has significant positive loadings of Rb, Sr and Y. The contribution of third, fourth and fifth factors is 10, 8 and 5% and show positive loadings for lead, molybdenum and barium respectively to the soil contamination. The spatial variation maps deciphering different zones of heavy metal concentration in the soil were generated in a GIS (geographic information system) based environment using ArcGIS 9.3.1. The results reveal that heavy metal contamination in the area is mainly due to anthropogenic activities.</p>

					<p>In the study area, changes in the facies of sediments and spores-pollen content appear to be all causally linked with the depositional set-up. Here, the qualitative and quantitative changes observed in the spores-pollen assemblages have led to recognize 10 Assemblage-zones representing from that earliest Permian in the Talchir Formation to that latest Late Triassic in the Parsora Formation. These sporespollen assemblages are obtained from the wider parts in the Singrauli Gondwana Basin that includes (i) Moher sub-basin (boreholes SSM-1 and 2), and (ii) Singrauli main sub-basin (boreholes SMJS-2, 3 and SMBS-1). The progressively changing spores-pollen content infer the hiatuses of varied magnitude in the sedimentary sequences during the extended time interval of Permian and Triassic.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the Holocene environmental changes of the southwest coast, India: A palaeopalynological approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1093-1103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The climatic variability and the influence of temperature and sea level fluctuations on the earth’s surface configuration during the Holocene are being discussed all over the world. The present study evaluates the palaeo-environmental conditions of western coast of India during this epoch through the analysis of pollen grains embedded in a carbonaceous clay formation (≅ 0.4-0.6 m) found sandwiched within the palaeodeposit of sand of Meenachil River basin. The carbon dating revealed that the clay formation has an age of 5786 ± 94<sup>14</sup>C yr BP, while the embedded wood samples have the age varying in between 2888 ± 78 and 5780 ± 95<sup>14</sup>C yr BP. The overall analysis suggests that the southwestern margin of India had experienced high intensity rainfall during the earlier part of the Atlantic chronozone due to then strengthened Asiatic monsoon, while water stagnation and hydrological modifications were observed during the later part. The dominance of weeds and lesser number of tree elements suggested a drier climate during the end of the Atlantic period. Besides, the morphometric rearrangement of the Meenachil River contemporaneous to the geomorphological modifications of the southwestern coast of India shall be classified into three categories: (1) Pre-Vembanad Lake formation, (2) Contemporaneous to lake formation and (3) Post-Lake formation.</p>

				<title>Glacier fluctuation using Satellite Data in Beas basin, 1972–2006, Himachal Pradesh, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1105-1112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glaciers are widely recognized as sensitive indicators for regional climate change. Very few studies have been conducted to investigate the long term deglaciation status in the Himalaya. In the present study, glaciers in the Beas basin, Himachal Pradesh, India were mapped by interpretation of various glaciomorphological features using the Landsat and IRS images. The mapping of 224 glaciers during the period 1972–2006 reveals that the glacier cover reduced from 419 to 371 km<sup>2</sup>, witnessing approximately 11.6% deglaciation in the Beas basin. A higher rate of retreat of the glaciers was observed during 1989–2006 as compared to the retreat during 1972–1989. Also, the loss has been more prominent in the glaciers with an areal extent of 2–5 km<sup>2</sup>. The number of glaciers increased from 224 to 236 due to fragmentation in this period. The average elevation of the ablation zone basin showed an upward shift from 3898 m (1972) to 4171 m (2006) which may be a consequence of a shift in Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) reflecting imbalance.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of short-period rainfall estimates from Kalpana-1 satellite using MET software</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1113-1123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) technique for rainfall estimation, has recently been developed to meet the shortcomings of the Global Precipitation Index (GPI) technique of rainfall estimation from the data of geostationary satellites; especially for accurate short period rainfall estimates. This study evaluates the 3-hourly precipitation estimates by this technique as well as the rainfall estimates by the GPI technique using data of the Kalpana-1 satellite, over the Indian region for the south-west monsoon season of 2010 to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses in estimating short period rainfall. The gridded 3 hourly accumulated TRMM satellite (3B42 V6 product or TMPA product) and surface raingauge data for stations over the Indian region for the same period is used as the standard measure of rainfall estimates. The Method for Object-based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE) utility of the METv3.0 software, has been used for the evaluation purpose. The results show that the new IMSRA technique is closer to the TMPA rainfall estimate, in terms of areal spread, geometric shape and location of rainfall areas, as compared to the GPI technique. The overlap of matching rainfall areas with respect to TMPA rainfall patches is also higher for the IMSRA estimates as compared to the GPI values. However, both satellite rainfall estimates are observed to be generally higher compared to the TMPA measurements. However, the values for the highest 10% of the rainfall rates in any rainfall patch, is generally higher for rainfall measured by the IMSRA technique, as compared to the estimates by the GPI technique. This may partly be due to the capping maximum limit of 3 mm/hr for rainfall measured by the GPI technique limits the total 3-hour accumulation to 9 mm even during heavy rainfall episodes. This is not so with IMSRA technique, which has no such limiting value. However, this general overestimation of the rainfall amount, measured by both techniques, and the greater error in case of IMSRA estimates, is also validated independently with respect to surface raingauge observations. Hence the observed overestimation by the IMSRA technique for the highest 10th percentile rainfall rates in rainfall episodes, is real. This overestimation by the latter technique may become a significant source of error, if the IMSRA estimate is used for monitoring very heavy rainfall episodes. In all other respects, since the IMSRA method shows significant improvement over the GPI, the rainfall estimates by the IMSRA method may be used for operational short period rainfall estimation.</p>

				<title>Implementation of Polar WRF for short range prediction of weather over Maitri region in Antarctica</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1125-1143</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India Meteorological Department has implemented Polar WRF model for the Maitri (lat. 70&#176; 45&#8242;S, long. 11&#176; 44&#8242;E) region at the horizontal resolution of 15 km using initial and boundary conditions of the Global Forecast System (GFS T-382) operational at the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Main objective of this paper is to examine the performance skill of the model in the short-range time scale over the Maitri region. An inter-comparison of the time series of daily mean sea level pressure and surface winds of Maitri for the 24 hours and 48 hours forecast against the corresponding observed fields has been made using 90 days data for the period from 1 December 2010 to 28 February 2011. The result reveals that the performance of the Polar WRF is reasonable, good and superior to that of IMD GFS forecasts. GFS shows an underestimation of mean sea level pressure of the order of 16–17 hPa with root mean square errors (RMSE) of order 21 hPa, whereas Polar WRF shows an overestimation of the order of 3–4 hPa with RMSE of 4 hPa. For the surface wind, GFS shows an overestimation of 1.9 knots at 24 hours forecast and an underestimation of 3.7 knots at 48 hours forecast with RMSE ranging between 8 and 11 knots. Whereas Polar WRF shows underestimation of 1.4 knots and 1.2 knots at 24 hours and 48 hours forecast with RMSE of 5 knots. The results of a case study illustrated in this paper, reveal that the model is capable of capturing synoptic weather features of Antarctic region. The performance of the model is found to be comparable with that of Antarctic Meso-scale Prediction System (AMPS) products.</p>

				<title>Abnormally large magnetospheric electric field on 9 November 2004 and its effect on equatorial ionosphere around the world</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1145-1161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There was a solar event around 1850 UT on 9th November 2004, associated with an abnormally large solar wind flow pressure and large southward interplanetary magnetic field, causing an abnormally large prompt penetration electric field between 1850 and 2100 UT. Abnormally large vertical F-region drifts by Jicamarca backscatter radar were reported associated with the event. The F-region over Jicamarca, Peru (14–16 LT) and Sao Luis, Brazil (16–18 LT) was lifted upward, broken into two portions and the upper one was blown out of the range of the ionosonde. At Fortaleza, an off-equatorial station in Brazil, the F-region was also lifted up but later the $f_\circ F_2$ increased due to the flow of ionization from upper layer blown up over the equatorial region. The F-region at Ascension Island (19–21 LT), an off-equatorial station, was lifted up without any deformations till 1915 LT but descended at 1930 LT due to reversal of electric field polarity. At Indian stations, Trivandrum and Waltair (00–02 LT), the F-region was pushed down and later disappeared as a consequence of enhanced westward ionospheric electric field in the night sector. The ionosonde did not receive any echo for a couple of hours till the next sunrise. The F-region at Kototaban (03–05 LT), Indonesia also disappeared after a rapid descend. At Kwajelien (06–08 LT) there was no equatorial type of sporadic-E at 07 to 09 LT due to the westward electric field.</p>

				<title>Surface ozone variation at Bhubaneswar and intra-corelationship study with various parameters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1163-1175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper summarizes the results of year long (December 2009 to January 2011) continuous measurements of daytime (0700–1745) ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in the ambient air and related meteorological parameters at Bhubaneswar (21&#176; 15&#8242;N–85&#176; 15&#8242;E), Odisha. The seasonal variation shows distinct daytime ozone maxima during winters with a peak in January (∼85 ppbv), a slight increase (∼38 ppbv) in June and lowest in August (∼20 ppbv). The backward trajectory analysis during winter months suggests long distance transport of airmass from mainly Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and western part of Indian peninsula, a major industrial hub. In other seasons, wind reaches the observation site from less polluted landmasses and the Bay of Bengal, thereby considerably reducing the pollution load. On the contrary, ozone build-up was found to be maximum and minimum in pre-monsoon and monsoon, respectively. An anti-weekend ozone effect (∼5 ppbv) was observed in winter. Paired t-test and F-test along with principal component analysis (PCA) were done to determine significance between various components (ozone, precursors and meteorological parameters). The t- and F-test showed significant monthly variation of ozone mixing ratio. The PCA showed that three components explained 79.1% of variances.</p>

				<title>Modelling near subsurface temperature with mixed type boundary condition for transient air temperature and vertical groundwater flow</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1177-1184</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Near-subsurface temperatures have signatures of climate change. Thermal models of subsurface have been constructed by prescribing time dependent Dirichlet type boundary condition wherein the temperature at the soil surface is prescribed and depth distribution of temperature is obtained. In this formulation it is not possible to include the relationship between air temperatures and the temperature of soil surface. However, if one uses a Robin type boundary condition, a transfer coefficient relates the air and soil surface temperatures which helps to determine both the temperature at the surface and at depth given near surface air temperatures. This coefficient is a function of meteorological conditions and is readily available. We have developed such a thermal model of near subsurface region which includes both heat conduction and advection due to groundwater flows and have presented numerical results for changes in the temperature–depth profiles for different values of transfer coefficient and groundwater flux. There are significant changes in temperature and depth profiles due to changes in the transfer coefficient and groundwater flux. The analytical model will find applications in the interpretation of the borehole geothermal data to extract both climate and groundwater flow signals.</p>

				<title>Tomographic, hydrochemical and isotopic investigations of the salinization processes in the oasis shallow aquifers, Nefzaoua region, southwestern Tunisia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1185-1200</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An electrical imaging tomography survey was carried out to identify the lateral and vertical salinity distribution in the oasis shallow aquifers of the Nefzaoua region located in southwestern Tunisia. In addition, hydrochemical and isotopic data were examined to determine the main factors and mechanisms controlling the groundwater chemistry and salinity. Locally, with respect to salinization processes, electrical imaging tomography results show that the storage basins of irrigation excess-water contribute to the increase of the salinity for the major part of the oasis nearby these basins. Major elements distribution and saturation indices indicate that dissolution of evaporites (halite, anhydrite and gypsum) is the main process controlling the groundwater mineralization. Isotopic data highlighted the effect of evaporation in the salinization of these waters. The correlation between the oxygen 18 and the chlorides data confirms the importance of evaporation effect and dissolution as main processes controlling the groundwater mineralization.</p>

				<title>Simulation of suspended sediment transport initialized with satellite derived suspended sediment concentrations</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1201-1213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Suspended sediment transport in the Gulf of Kachchh is simulated utilizing the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) derived from Oceansat OCM imagery, as the initial condition in MIKE-21 Mud Transport model. Optimization of the model mud parameters, like settling velocity and critical shear stress for erosion are realized with respect to the sediment size distribution and the bottom bed materials observed in the Gulf. Simulated SSCs are compared with alternate OCM derived SSC. The results are observed to be impetus where the model is able to generate the spatial dynamics of the sediment concentrations. Sediment dynamics like deposition, erosion and dispersion are explained with the simulated tidal currents and OCM derived sediment concentrations. Tidal range is observed as the important physical factor controlling the deposition and resuspension of sediments within the Gulf. From the simulation studies; maximum residual current velocities, tidal fronts and high turbulent zones are found to characterise the islands and shoals within the Gulf, which results in high sediment concentrations in those regions. Remarkable variability in the bathymetry of the Gulf, different bed materials and varying tidal conditions induces several circulation patterns and turbulence creating the unique suspended sediment concentration pattern in the Gulf.</p>

				<title>Behaviour of REEs in a tropical estuary and adjacent continental shelf of southwest coast of India: Evidence from anomalies</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1215-1227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The distribution and accumulation of the rare earth elements (REE) in the sediments of the Cochin Estuary and adjacent continental shelf were investigated. The rare earth elements like La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu and the heavy metals like Mg, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, U, Th were analysed by using standard analytical methods. The Post-Archean Australian Shale composition was used to normalise the rare earth elements. It was found that the sediments were more enriched with the lighter rare earth elements than the heavier ones. The positive correlation between the concentrations of REE, Fe and Mn could explain the precipitation of oxyhydroxides in the study area. The factor analysis and correlation analysis suggest common sources of origin for the REEs. From the Ce-anomalies calculated, it was found that an oxic environment predominates in all stations except the station No. 2. The Eu-anomaly gave an idea that the origin of REEs may be from the feldspar. The parameters like total organic carbon, U/Th ratio, authigenic U, Cu/Zn, V/Cr ratios revealed the oxic environment and thus the depositional behaviour of REEs in the region.</p>

				<title>Vegetation history and salinity gradient during the last 3700 years in Pichavaram estuary, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1229-1237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Palaeoclimate, palaeoecological and palaeoshoreline studies were carried out for a 2.5 m deep sediment core deposited since ∼3700 yrs BP in the central part of Pichavaram mangrove wetland, Cauvery river delta. Presently, the study area is dominated by <i>Avicennia officinalis, A. marina and Suaeda</i> sp. with fringes of <i>Rhizophora</i> sp. along the backwater channel. Based on sedimentology, palynological and thecamoebian analysis, it is inferred that since 2100 yrs BP the climate amelioration took place from warm and humid with strengthened monsoon to a dry and arid climate coupled with weakened monsoon condition inducing changes in ecology vulnerable for mangroves. Consequently, the vegetation too evolved from moist deciduous/evergreen forest to mixed deciduous forest and a reduction in mangrove diversity. The qualitative and quantitative study show a decline in the mangroves since the last millennium which may be attributed to the increased salinity along with enhanced anthropogenic activities in Pichavaram estuary. This is reflected by the dominance of salt tolerant mangrove associates since the last millennium.</p>

				<title>Stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental framework of the Early Permian sequence in the Salt Range, Pakistan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1239-1255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Early Permian Gondwana regime succession of the Nilawahan Group is exposed only in the Salt Range of Pakistan. After a prolonged episode of non-deposition that spanned much of the Palaeozoic, the 350 m thick predominantly clastic sequence of the Nilawahan Group records a late glacial and post-glacial episode in which a range of glacio-fluvial, marine and fluvial environments evolved and accumulated. The Early Permian succession of the Salt Range has been classified into four formations, which together indicates a changing climatic regime during the Early Permian in the Salt Range region. The lower-most, Tobra Formation unconformably overlies a Cambrian sequence and is composed of tillite, diamictite and fresh water facies, which contain a floral assemblage (<i>Gangamopteris</i> and <i>Glossopteris</i>) that confirms an Asselian age. The Tobra Formation is overlain by marginal marine deposits of the Dandot Formation (Sakmarian), which contain an abundant brachiopods assemblage (<i>Eurydesma</i> and <i>Conularia</i>). Accumulation of the Dandot Formation was terminated by a regional sea-level fall and a change to the deposition of the fluvial deposits of the Warchha Sandstone (Artinskian). The Warchha Sandstone was deposited by high sinuosity meandering, avulsion prone river with well developed floodplains. This episode of fluvial sedimentation was terminated by a widespread marine transgression, as represented by the abrupt upward transition to the overlying shallow marine Sardhai Formation (Kungurian). The Early Permian Gondwana sequence represented by the Nilawahan Group is capped by predominantly shallow shelf carbonate deposits of the Tethyan realm. The sedimentologic and stratigraphic relationship of these four lithostratigraphic units in the Salt Range reveals a complex stratigraphic history for the Early Permian, which is mainly controlled by eustatic sea-level change due to climatic variation associated with climatic amelioration at the end of the major Gondwana glacial episode, and the gradual regional northward drift to a lower latitude of the Indian plate.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Palynological investigations of five borecores, <i>viz</i>., GAM-3, GAM-6, GAM-7, GAM-8 and GAM-10 from Mailaram area have suggested the occurrence of complete Lower Gondwana succession in Mailaram area. Total nine palynozones have been identified on the basis of dominance, sub-dominance and appearance of various palynotaxa. These palynozones belong to Talchir, Upper Karharbari and Barakar (Early Permian), Raniganj (Late Permian) and Panchet (Early Triassic) palynofloras of Indian Gondwana. The oldest Palynozone-1 demonstrated in borecore GAM-6 (331.4–500 m) and borecore GAM-10 (505.66–581.55 m), is characterized by the dominance of <i>Parasaccites</i> and sub-dominance of <i>Plicatipollenites</i> belongs to Talchir Palynoflora; Palynozone-2 identified in borecore GAM-7 (667–749 m) and borecore GAM-8 (89.75 m) is characterized by the dominance of <i>Parasaccites</i> and sub-dominance of <i>Scheuringipollenites</i> which belongs to Upper Karharbari Palynoflora. Palynozone-3, identified in borecore GAM-6 (149.7–240.05 m) and borecore GAM-8 (84.95 m), is characterized by the dominance of <i>Scheuringipollenites</i> akin to <i>Scheuringipollenites</i> zone of Barakar palynoflora; Palynozone-4, recorded in borecores GAM-3 (294–437.98 m), GAM-7 (453–640.5 m) and GAM-8 (35.35 m) is characterized by the dominance of <i>Faunipollenites</i> and sub-dominance of <i>Striatopodocarpites</i> along with certain stratigraphically significant taxa, <i>viz., Weylandites, Guttulapollenites, Corisaccites, Aurangapollenites</i> and <i>Osmundacidites</i>. Palynozone-5, demarcated in borecore GAM-3 (144.86–221.3 m) and borecore GAM-10 (35.35 m), is distinguished by the dominance of striate disaccates along with at least 30% pollen assigned to <i>Striasulcites</i>; Palynozone-6, identified in borecore GAM-3 (35.1–73.08 m) and borecore GAM-7 (231–423 m), is characterized by the dominance of striate disaccates along with 20–30% of <i>Densipollenites</i>; Palynozone-7, recorded in borecore GAM-7 (206 m), is distinguished by the dominance of <i>Crescentipollenites</i> along with striate disaccates; Palynozone-8, identified in borecore GAM-7 (178.4 m), is characterized by the distinguished presence of taeniate pollen <i>Guttulapollenites</i>. Palynozones 4–8 belong to Raniganj Palynoflora. Palynozone-9, identified in borecore GAM-7 (166 m), is discriminated by the dominance of trilete spore <i>Verrucosisporites</i> and sub-dominance of taeniate pollen <i>Lunatisporites</i> which belongs to Triassic palynoflora. On the basis of palynological data Palynozone-1 (= Talchir palynoflora), Palynozone-2 and Palynozone-3 have been assigned to Early Permian age; Palynozones 4–8 (= Raniganj palynoflora) have been assigned to Late Permian age and Palynozone-9 (= Triassic palynoflora) has been assigned to Early Triassic age. With the aim of correlating the Permian and Triassic sediments of Mailaram area palynological investigations of five borecores were carried out.</p>

				<title>Permian Triassic palynofloral transition in Chintalapudi area, Godavari Graben, Andhra Pradesh, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1287-1303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The entire 606 m-thick sedimentary sequence in borecore MCP-7 from Chintalapudi area, Chintalapudi sub-basin has been lithologically designated as Kamthi Formation. However, the palynological investigation revealed five distinct palynoassemblages, which essentially fall under two groups, one group (Palynoassemblage-I, II and III) having dominance of striate disaccates along with presence of some stratigraphically significant taxa, belongs to Late Permian (Raniganj) palynoflora, while the other group (Palynoassemblages IV and V) shows sharp decline in percentage of characteristic taxa of first group, i.e., striate disaccates, and consequent rise or dominance of taeniate and cingulate cavate spores, belongs to Early Triassic (Panchet) palynoflora. Palynoassemblage-I, II and III (Group I) are characterized by dominance of striate disaccates chiefly, <i>Striatopodocarpites</i> spp. and <i>Faunipollenites</i> spp. Along with presence of rare but stratigraphically significant taxa, viz., <i>Gondisporites raniganjensis, Falcisporites nuthaliensis, Klausipollenites schaubergeri, Chordasporites</i> sp., <i>Striomonosaccites, ovatus, Crescentipollenites multistriatus, Verticipollenites debiles, Strotersporites crassiletus, Guttulapollenites hannonicus, G. gondwanensis, Hamiapollenites insolitus, Corisaccites alutus, Lunatisporites ovatus, Weylandites</i> spp. and <i>Vitreisporites pallidus</i>. Palynoassemblage-I is distinguished by significant presence of <i>Densipollenites</i> spp. while Palynoassemblage-II shows significant presence of <i>Crescentipollenites</i> spp. and Palynoassemblage-III differs from the above two assemblages in having significant presence of <i>Guttulapollenites hannonicus</i>. Palynoassemblage-IV (Group II) is characterized by high percentage of taeniate disaccates chiefly <i>Lunatisporites</i> spp., while Palynoassemblage-V (Group II) is characterized by cingulate-cavate trilete spores chiefly, <i>Lundbladispora</i> spp. and <i>Densoisporites</i> spp. Striate disaccates show a sharp decline in these two assemblages.</p>
					<p>In Chintalapudi area Late Permian and Early Triassic palynoflora has been recorded for the first time indicating existence of Raniganj and Panchet sediments as well. The study further supports the earlier studies of Jha and Srivastava (1996) that Kamthi Formation represents Early Triassic (=Panchet Formation) overlying Raniganj equivalent sediments with a gradational contact.</p>

				<title>Toxic gas emissions from the Kayseri peat deposit, central Anatolia, Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1305-1315</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Toxic gases evolving from the soil in urbanized peatland regions constitute a serious hazard since buildings may be subject to the direct ingress of volatiles into the structures. Peat formed in swamp and rarely exposed to subaerial conditions has been associated with the development of the folded foreland of the Quaternary Kayseri pull-apart basin. The peat deposit is extensively urbanized but so far no studies have evaluated the extent of the ground gas hazard. In this paper, the geology, petrography and chemical variation of the Kayseri peat deposit have been studied in order to predict the public health risk from the land gases’ behaviour, especially in soil gases. The main volatile species detected are methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), all of which are highly toxic. The primary means of gas entry is directly from the ground through the floors, walls, and especially subsurface telephone cable pipes. Indoor vents emit 1000–70,000 ppm CH<sub>4</sub>, 330–49,000 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> and 3.8–6.5 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S in soil and subsurface pipes; concentrations high enough to present an acute respiratory hazard to persons close to the vents.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry of abyssal peridotites from the super slow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge near 65&#176;E: Implications for magma source and seawater alteration</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1317-1336</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geochemical characteristics of abyssal peridotite samples from one dredge station (27&#176; 49.74&#8242;S, 65&#176; 02.14&#8242;E, water depth 4473 m) on the super slow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) near 65&#176;E were investigated. Abyssal peridotites recovered from this site were comprised mainly of lizardite, chlorite, carbonate and magnetite with minor amounts of talc, pyroxene phenocrysts and sparse olivines.</p>
					<p>Serpentinites exhibit talc veins and major serpentine derived from serpentinization with relict olivine granuloblasts. Olivine grains in serpentinites display exsolution lamellae, indicating the occurrence of talc reduction or decompression during seawater–rock interaction. Pyroxene shows clear cleavage in two directions, with clinopyroxene or orthopyroxene exsolution lamellae. By contrast, bulk rock trace element patterns of serpentinites reveal depletion in most incompatible elements, similarly to the depleted midocean ridge basalt mantle composition, indicating that the SWIR peridotites originated from a depleted mantle source magma and have experienced partial melting. Meanwhile, Rb, Ba, U, Pb, Sr, Li anomalies and the Ce/Pb ratio suggest that these serpentinites have been strongly altered by seawater.</p>

				<title>Landslide susceptibility analysis using Probabilistic Certainty Factor Approach: A case study on Tevankarai stream watershed, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1337-1350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper reports the use of a GIS based Probabilistic Certainty Factor method to assess the geo-environmental factors that contribute to landslide susceptibility in Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal. Landslide occurrences are a common phenomenon in the Tevankarai Ar sub-watershed, Kodaikkanal owing to rugged terrain at high altitude, high frequency of intense rainfall and rapidly expanding urban growth. The spatial database of the factors influencing landslides are compiled primarily from topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite images. They are relief, slope, aspect, curvature, weathering, soil, land use, proximity to road and proximity to drainage. Certainty Factor Approach is used to study the interaction between the factors and the landslide, highlighting the importance of each factor in causing landslide. The results show that slope, aspect, soil and proximity to roads play important role in landslide susceptibility. The landslide susceptibility map is classified into five susceptible classes – low, very low, uncertain, high and very high − 93.32% of the study area falls under the stable category and 6.34% falls under the highly and very highly unstable category. The relative landslide density index (R index) is used to validate the landslide susceptibility map. R index increases with the increase in the susceptibility class. This shows that the factors selected for the study and susceptibility mapping using certainty factor are appropriate for the study area. Highly unstable zones show intense anthropogenic activities like high density settlement areas, and busy roads connecting the hill town and the plains.</p>

				<title>Deterministic seismic hazard macrozonation of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1351-1364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earthquakes are known to have occurred in Indian subcontinent from ancient times. This paper presents the results of seismic hazard analysis of India (6&#176;–38&#176;N and 68&#176;–98&#176;E) based on the deterministic approach using latest seismicity data (up to 2010). The hazard analysis was done using two different source models (linear sources and point sources) and 12 well recognized attenuation relations considering varied tectonic provinces in the region. The earthquake data obtained from different sources were homogenized and declustered and a total of 27,146 earthquakes of moment magnitude 4 and above were listed in the study area. The sesismotectonic map of the study area was prepared by considering the faults, lineaments and the shear zones which are associated with earthquakes of magnitude 4 and above. A new program was developed in MATLAB for smoothing of the point sources. For assessing the seismic hazard, the study area was divided into small grids of size 0.1&#176; &#215; 0.1&#176; (approximately 10 &#215; 10 km), and the hazard parameters were calculated at the center of each of these grid cells by considering all the seismic sources within a radius of 300 to 400 km. Rock level peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) and spectral accelerations for periods 0.1 and 1 s have been calculated for all the grid points with a deterministic approach using a code written in MATLAB. Epistemic uncertainty in hazard definition has been tackled within a logic-tree framework considering two types of sources and three attenuation models for each grid point. The hazard evaluation without logic tree approach also has been done for comparison of the results. The contour maps showing the spatial variation of hazard values are presented in the paper.</p>

				<title>Ninety million years of orogenesis, 250 million years of quiescence and further orogenesis with no change in PT: Significance for the role of deformation in porphyroblast growth</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1365-1399</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>In situ</i> dating of monazite grains preserved as inclusions within foliations defining FIAs (foliation inflection/intersection axes preserved within porphyroblasts) contained within garnet, staurolite, andalusite and cordierite porphyroblasts provides a chronology of ages that matches the FIA succession for the Big Thompson region of the northern Colorado Rocky Mountains. FIA sets 1, 2 and 3 trending NE–SW, E–W and SE–NW were formed at 1760.5 ± 9.7, 1719.7 ± 6.4 and 1674 ± 11± Ma, respectively. For three samples where garnet first grew during just one of each of these FIAs, the intersection of Ca, Mg, and Fe isopleths in their cores indicate that these rocks never got above 4 kbars throughout the Colorado Orogeny. Furthermore, they remained around approximately the same depth for ∼250 million years to the onset of the younger Berthoud Orogeny at 1415 ± 16 Ma when the pressure decreased slightly as porphyroblasts formed with inclusion trails preserving FIA set 4 trending NNE–SSW. No porphyroblast growth occurred during the intervening ∼250 million years of quiescence, even though the PT did not change over this period. This confirms microstructural evidence gathered over the past 25 years that crenulation deformation at the scale of a porphyroblast is required for reactions to re-initiate and enable further growth.</p>

				<title>Metallogenic epoch of the Jiapigou gold belt, Jilin Province, China: Constrains from rare earth element, fluid inclusion geochemistry and geochronology</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1401-1420</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Jiapigou gold belt is located on the northern margin of the North China Craton, and is one of the most important gold-mining and production regions in the circum-Pacific metallogenic zone. Research has been conducted in this area since the 1960s, however, the timing of the gold mineralisation is still unresolved, and an ideal metallogenic model has not been well established. To address these questions, a systematic geological, geochemical and geochronological investigation was conducted. The study revealed that (i) the gold-bearing quartz veins can be divided into two groups, earlier and later gold-bearing quartz veins according to their occurrence and the geochemical characteristics, (ii) the geochemical characteristics of the ore bodies, while similar to granite, are clearly different from the altered rock, and (iii) the geochemical characteristics of the later gold-bearing quartz veins have more similarity to the altered rock than the earlier gold-bearing quartz veins do. Therefore, we conclude that two independent stages of metallogenesis within the Jiapigou gold deposit area are related to magmatic activity in the Palaeoproterozoic and the Yanshanian stage of the Mesozoic, that the ore-forming fluids are mainly of magmatic origin, and that magma contamination by the altered rock was stronger in the Mesozoic. Zircon LA–ICP–MS U–Pb data show that the age of the Palaeoproterozoic granite is ∼2426.0 Ma and that of the Mesozoic granite is ∼166.2 Ma; these ages can be interpreted as the maximum ages of the two periods of gold mineralisation. In addition to investigating the geotectonic and regional structure of the Jiapigou gold belt, this study also proposes that the WNW-trending zone of gold mineralization is a result of a magmatic event within the basement in the early Palaeoproterozoic, and that largescale sinistral strike-slip displacements of the Huifahe and Liangjiang Faults in the late Middle Triassic (Yanshanian epoch) controlled the later tectono-magmatic event and the NNE–ENE-trending zone of gold mineralisation.</p>

The horizontal-component S-waves of 144 well located earthquakes (2001–2010) recorded at 3–10 broadband seismograph sites in the Kachchh Seismic Zone, Gujarat, India are analyzed, and their seismic corner frequencies, long-period spectral levels and crustal 𝑄 values are simultaneously estimated by inverting the horizontal component of the S-wave displacement spectrum using the Levenberg–Marquardt nonlinear inversion technique, wherein the inversion scheme is formulated based on the 𝜔-square source spectral model. The static stress drops (𝛥 𝜎 ) are then calculated from the corner frequency and seismic moment.</p>
					<p>The estimated source parameters suggest that the seismic moment ($M_0$) and source radius (𝑟) of aftershocks are varying from 1.12 &#215; 10<sup>12</sup> to 4.00 &#215; 10<sup>16</sup> N-m and 132.57 to 513.20 m, respectively. Whereas, estimated stress drops (𝛥 𝜎) and multiplicative factor ($E_{mo}$) values range from 0.01 to 20.0 MPa and 1.05 to 3.39, respectively. The corner frequencies are found to be ranging from 2.36 to 8.76 Hz. The crustal S-wave quality factor varies from 256 to 1882 with an average of 840 for the Kachchh region, which agrees well with the crustal 𝑄 value of the seismically active New Madrid region, USA. Our estimated stress drop values are quite large compared to the other similar size Indian intraplate earthquakes, which can be attributed to the presence of crustal mafic intrusives and aqueous fluids in the lower crust as revealed by the earlier tomographic study of the region.</p>

				<title>Multivariate erosion risk assessment of lateritic badlands of Birbhum (West Bengal, India): A case study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1441-1454</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Each geomorphic hazard involves a degree of risk which incorporates quantification of the probability that a hazard will be harmful. At present, the categorization of sub-watersheds into erosion risk is considered as the fundamental step to conserve the soil loss. Development of badlands over the laterites of Birbhum district is an indicative of excessive soil loss in the monsoonal wet-dry type of climate. Slope erosion and channel erosion have generated huge amount of sediment from the small watersheds during intense monsoonal rainfall (June–September). The adjoining areas of Rampurhat I Block, Birbhum (West Bengal) and Shikaripara Block, Dumka (Jharkhand) have lost the lateritic soil cover at a rate of 20–40 ton/ha/year (Sarkar <i>et al</i>. 2005). In order to estimate the progressive removal of soil particles from the gully-catchments of the above-mentioned area, different morphometric parameters, soil parameters, hydrologic parameters and empirical models are employed. Side by side, the study is carried out to categorize the gully-catchments into different magnitude of erosion risk using several multivariate statistical techniques.</p>

				<title>Exploring deep potential aquifer in water scarce crystalline rocks</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1455-1468</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characterization of the shear zone with pole–pole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was carried out to explore deep groundwater potential zone in a water scarce granitic area. As existing field conditions does not always allow to plant the remote electrodes at sufficiently far of distance, the effect of insufficient distance of remote electrodes on apparent resistivity measurement was studied and shown that the transverse pole–pole array affects less compared to the collinear pole–pole array. Correction factor have been computed for transverse pole–pole array for various positions of the remote electrodes. The above results helped in exploring deep aquifer site, where a 270 m deep well was drilled. Temporal hydro-chemical samples collected during the pumping indicated the hydraulic connectivity between the demarcated groundwater potential fractures. Incorporating all the information derived from different investigations, a subsurface model was synthetically simulated and generated 2D electrical resistivity response for different arrays and compared with the field responses to further validate the geoelectrical response of deep aquifer set-up associated with lineament.</p>

				<title>Above-ground tree outside forest (TOF) phytomass and carbon estimation in the semiarid region of southern Haryana: A synthesis approach of remote sensing and field data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1469-1482</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trees outside forest (TOF) play an important role in global carbon cycling, since they are large pools of carbon as well as potential carbon sinks and sources to the atmosphere. In view of the importance of biomass estimates in the global carbon (C) cycle, the present study demonstrates the potential of the standwise tree outside forest inventory data and finer spatial resolution of IRS-P6 LISS-IV satellite data to classify TOF, to estimate above-ground TOF phytomass and the carbon content of TOF in a semiarid region of the southern Haryana, India. The study reports that above-ground TOF phytomass varied from 1.26 tons/ha in the scattered trees in the rural/urban area to 91.5 tons/ha in the dense linear TOF along the canal. The total above-ground TOF phytomass and carbon content was calculated as 367.04 and 174.34 tons/ha, respectively in the study area. The study results conclude that the classification of TOF and estimation of phytomass and carbon content in TOF can be successfully achieved through the combined approach of Remote Sensing and GIS based spatial technique with the supplement of field data. The present approach will help to find out the potential carbon sequestration zone in the semi-arid region of southern Haryana, India.</p>

				<title>An assessment of the FlowCapt acoustic sensor for measuring snowdrift in the Indian Himalayas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1483-1491</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wind caused snow drifting plays a dominant role in the redistribution of snow mass that restructures a snowpack. Strong wind activity at the mountain tops results in uneven distribution of snow with erosion on windward side and deposition on leeward areas. Such snowdrift events are responsible for the formation of cornices, increase in the loading of avalanche release zones on the leeward side and consequent increase in the level of avalanche hazard. In this paper, we present the results of snowdrift measurement using an acoustic snow-drift meter, the FlowCapt, built by IAV Engineering, which was used during winter seasons of 2007–2010 at a field research station of Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) in the western Himalayas. The aim of the study was to evaluate the suitability of the instrument in measuring snowdrift in the Himalayan weather conditions. Results proved the utility of the instrument as a useful tool to study drifting snow in remote areas. However, in the absence of conventional snow gauges for validation, the quality of the absolute snow flux data could not be ascertained.</p>

				<title>The assessment of geodiversity – a premise for declaring the geopark Buzăului County (Romania)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1493-1500</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The geopark Buzăului County does not belong to the Geoparks European Network, as there are numerous governmental, legislative and scientific initiatives in this respect. The geopark is situated in the central-south-eastern part of Romania (in Buzau county) and it has a special potential of geological, geomorphological, biogeographical and anthropic nature, a potential which has to be developed and brought into value. The idea of creating a geopark in this area is relatively recent and it was realized by a series of actions carried on by local authorities in partnership with several institutions, a partnership within which it was accomplished the proposal of a general development framework of the geopark, as well as the launching of a promotion campaign. The scope of this work is to evaluate the geodiversity existing in this space as an important starting point in declaring it as a European geopark, being known that it represents a real “open air museum”. The high values of geodiversity and biodiversity represent special strong points in this respect. The method we used was taken from the specialised literature, suffering a series of adjustments to the specifics of the studied area.</p>
					<p>In the present format, the method is applied for the first time in the Geography literature, so the values obtained cannot be compared with those obtained by other calculation formulas. Thus, values between 0.20 and 1.91 which resulted cover the entire scale of variables proposed.</p>

				<title>Prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation using Artificial Neural Network</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1501-1510</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a multilayer feed forward (MLFF) neural network based on back propagation algorithm was developed, trained, and tested to predict monthly mean daily global radiation in Tamil Nadu, India. Various geographical, solar and meteorological parameters of three different locations with diverse climatic conditions were used as input parameters. Out of 565 available data, 530 were used for training and the rest were used for testing the artificial neural network (ANN). A 3-layer and a 4-layer MLFF networks were developed and the performance of the developed models was evaluated based on mean bias error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean squared error and Student’s 𝑡-test. The 3-layer MLFF network developed in this study did not give uniform results for the three chosen locations. Hence, a 4-layer MLFF network was developed and the average value of the mean absolute percentage error was found to be 5.47%. Values of global radiation obtained using the model were in excellent agreement with measured values. Results of this study show that the designed ANN model can be used to estimate monthly mean daily global radiation of any place in Tamil Nadu where measured global radiation data are not available.</p>

				<title>Tidal and gravity waves study from the airglow measurements at Kolhapur (India)</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Simultaneous photometric measurements of the OI 557.7 nm and OH (7, 2) band from a low latitude station, Kolhapur (16.8&#176;N, 74.2&#176;E) during the period 2004–2007 are analyzed to study the dominant waves present in the 80–100 km altitude region of the atmosphere. The nocturnal intensity variations of different airglow emissions are observed using scanning temperature controlled filter photometers. Waves having period lying between 2 and 12 hours have been recorded. Some of these waves having subharmonic tidal oscillation periods 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours propagate upward with velocity lying in the range 1.6–11.3 m/s and the vertical wave length lying between 28.6 and 163 kms. The other waves may be the upward propagating gravity waves or waves resulting from the interaction of inter-mode tidal oscillations, interaction of tidal waves with planetary waves and gravity waves. Some times, the second harmonic wave has higher vertical velocity than the corresponding fundamental wave. Application of these waves in studying the thermal structure of the region is discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A critical analysis made on the long-term monthly, seasonal, yearly variation and annual cycle of total column ozone (TCO) concentration at New Delhi (29&#176;N,77&#176;E), India and Halley Bay (76&#176;S, 27&#176;W), a British Antarctic Service Station reveals more decline in yearly mean ozone concentration at Halley Bay than at New Delhi from 1979 to 2005. The nature of variations of monthly mean TCO during the months of August and September was the most identical with that of yearly mean ozone values at New Delhi and Halley Bay, respectively, for the same period. Annual cycles of TCO over these stations are completely different for the above period. The effect of O<sub>3</sub> depletion on night airglow emission of OH(8, 3) line at New Delhi and Halley Bay has been studied. Calculations based on chemical kinetics show that the airglow intensity of OH(8, 3) has also been affected due to the depletion of O<sub>3</sub> concentration. The yearly variations and annual cycle of intensities of OH(8, 3) line for the above two stations are depicted and compared. It has been shown that the rate of decrease of intensity of OH(8, 3) line was comparatively more at Halley Bay due to dramatic decrease of Antarctic O<sub>3</sub> concentration.</p>

				<title>Present and future water resources in India: Insights from satellite remote sensing and a dynamic global vegetation model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India is a country of particular interest with regard to its future water resources, as it is expected to undergo continued rapid population growth while also being especially sensitive to climate change. The Land-surface Processes and eXchanges Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPX-DGVM) is used here to simulate present and future runoff in India using ClimGen pattern-scaled scenarios of 1&#176;, 2&#176; and 4&#176;C temperature increase (scaled to 2050) forced by six general circulation models (GCMs). As is the case with many DGVMs, groundwater storage is not simulated by LPX, so in order to form a more comprehensive understanding of water resources, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite estimates for north-west India are incorporated into this study and compared to LPX runoff simulations. Runoff is simulated to have increased slightly (1.5 mm/year) in this region during 2002–2006, while groundwater extractions appear to have been made at rates of 40 ± 10 mm/year.</p>
					<p>North-west India is simulated to experience considerable increases in runoff by 2070–2099, with a mean change of 189 mm/year for 2&#176;C climate change (although the range of model results, 247 mm/year, demonstrates high uncertainty among GCMs). Precipitation is shown to have an important bearing on runoff generation, while the degree of warming is shown to affect the magnitude of future runoff. This may subsequently influence the longevity of the local groundwater resource. However, at recent rates of depletion and in view of expected population growth, the long-term sustainability of groundwater reserves in north-west India is in doubt.</p>

				<title>Investigation of sulphate origins in the Jeffara aquifer, southeastern Tunisia: A geochemical approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0015-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemical composition of groundwater within the multilayer Jeffara aquifer and the detailed analysis of saturation indices enables identification of the origin of mineralization and hydrogeochemical processes occurring in groundwater. It has been demonstrated that groundwater is mainly characterized by a Ca–Mg–SO4–Cl water type. Geochemical pattern is controlled by the dissolution of evaporites, largely abundant in the study area and incongruent dissolution of dolomite. Gypsum, anhydrite, mirabilite and thenardite have been examined as potential sources of sulphate dissolved in groundwater. Since Jeffara groundwater is recharged by the Continental Intercalaire (CI) geothermal water, water temperature decreases from the CI to the Jeffara aquifer. Solubility of the majority of minerals is modified by this change in temperature and thus a mixing process of thermal and non-thermal waters was examined.</p>

				<title>Delineation of aquifers in basaltic hard rock terrain using vertical electrical soundings data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0029-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The region under investigation for groundwater exploration is a part of the eastern fringe of Deccan traps in Kalmeshwar Taluk of Nagpur district. In this region, groundwater is the main source of water supply for drinking and irrigation purposes. Presently, the known source of groundwater is the upper weathered mantle in the depth range of 8–15 m. This source of groundwater has been overexploited because of increasing demand of water supply and is unable to meet the present requirement. The present work deals with the delineation of new sources of groundwater at deeper levels concealed within and below the traps by using vertical electrical sounding surveys in order to meet the increasing demand of water supply.</p>

				<title>Hydrogeological characterization and assessment of groundwater quality in shallow aquifers in vicinity of Najafgarh drain of NCT Delhi</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0043-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Najafgarh drain is the biggest drain in Delhi and contributes about 60% of the total wastewater that gets discharged from Delhi into river Yamuna. The drain traverses a length of 51 km before joining river Yamuna, and is unlined for about 31 km along its initial stretch. In recent times, efforts have been made for limited withdrawal of groundwater from shallow aquifers in close vicinity of Najafgarh drain coupled with artificial recharge of groundwater. In this perspective, assessment of groundwater quality in shallow aquifers in vicinity of the Najafgarh drain of Delhi and hydrogeological characterization of adjacent areas were done. The groundwater quality was examined in perspective of Indian as well as World Health Organization’s drinking water standards. The spatial variation in groundwater quality was studied. The linkages between trace element occurrence and hydrochemical facies variation were also established. The shallow groundwater along Najafgarh drain is contaminated in stretches and the area is not suitable for large-scale groundwater development for drinking water purposes.</p>

				<title>Geochemical assessment of light gaseous hydrocarbons in near-surface soils of Kutch–Saurashtra: Implication for hydrocarbon prospects</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0055-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Light hydrocarbons in soil have been used as direct indicators in geochemical hydrocarbon exploration, which remains an unconventional path in the petroleum industry. The occurrence of adsorbed soil gases, methane and heavier homologues were recorded in the near-surface soil samples collected from Kutch–Saurashtra, India. Soil gas alkanes were interpreted to be derived from deep-seated hydrocarbon sources and have migrated to the surface through structural discontinuities. The source of hydrocarbons is assessed to be thermogenic and could have been primarily derived from humic organic matter with partial contribution from sapropelic matter. Gas chromatographic analyses of hydrocarbons desorbed from soil samples through acid extraction technique showed the presence of methane through 𝑛-butane and the observed concentrations (in ppb) vary from: methane (C<sub>1</sub>) from 4–291, ethane (C<sub>2</sub>) from 0–84, propane (C<sub>3</sub>) from 0–37, i-butane (iC<sub>4</sub>) from 0–5 and 𝑛-butane (nC<sub>4</sub>) from 0–4. Carbon isotopes measured for methane and ethane by GC-C-IRMS, range between −42.9‰ to −13.3‰ (Pee Dee Belemnite – PDB) and −21.2‰ to −12.4‰ (PDB), respectively. The increased occurrence of hydrocarbons in the areas near Anjar of Kutch and the area south to Rajkot of Saurashtra signifies the area potential for oil and gas.</p>

				<title>Geochemical study of volcanic and associated granitic rocks from Endau Rompin, Johor, Peninsular Malaysia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0065-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geochemical studies and modelling show that both volcanic and granitic magmas from the western part of the Johor National Park, Endau Rompin are different and probably have different sources. The geochemical plot suggests that both dacite/rhyolite and andesite probably have a common origin as in many of the geochemical plots, these two groups form a similar trend. Volcanic rocks have a transitional geochemical character between tholeiite and calc alkaline on a Y versus Zr plot. $(La/Yb)_N$ versus La and TiO<sub>2</sub> versus Zr modelling show that the crystallization of both granitic and volcanic magmas are controlled by a different set of minerals. The rare earth elements (REE) patterns of some of the granite and volcanic samples have pronounced negative Eu anomaly indicating plagioclase fractionation. The difference between both profiles is that the granite samples show a concave shape profile which is consistent with liquids produced by partial melting of quartz feldspathic rocks containing amphibole among the residual phase. Both magmas were generated at a different time during the subduction of Sibumasu beneath the Indochina blocks.</p>

				<title>Platinum group elements geochemistry of ultramafic and associated rocks from Pindar in Madawara Igneous Complex, Bundelkhand massif, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0079-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ultramafic rocks comprising dunite, harburgite, lehzolite, olivine webserite and websterite occur as intrusives in the form of small hillocks at around Pindar into the granite–gneisses of Bundelkhand Gneissic Complex (BnGC). The peridotites are dominated by olivine cumulates where chromite and precious metal-bearing sulphides crystallized along with pyroxenes, subsequent to crystallization of olivine into the interstitial spaces of cumulates during cooling. Ultramafic rocks of Pindar are characterized by high MgO (up to 46.0 wt%) and FeO (up to 5.8 wt%); low SiO<sub>2</sub> (40.8 to 48.0 wt%), TiO<sub>2</sub> (0.2 to 0.5 wt%), Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (∼3.2 wt% av.), CaO(∼ 2.7 wt% av.) and Cu (11 to 73 𝜇  g/g). Cr and Ni values range from 2297 to 3150 𝜇 g/g and 2434 to 2767  𝜇 g/g, respectively. Distribution of Ir (up to 20 ng/g), Ru (27 to 90 ng/g), Rh (3 to 14 ng/g), Pt (18 to 72 ng/g), Pd (10 to 27 ng/g) and Au (22 to 57 ng/g) indicate platinum group element (PGE) and associated gold mineralization in these ultramafic rocks. A mineral phase representing sperrylite (PtAs<sub>2</sub>) was also identified within the sulphides in Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM–EDS) studies. The primitive mantle-normalized siderophile elements pattern shows platinum group element PGE (PPGE) enrichment (Rh, Pt, Pd). Discrimination diagrams of Pd/Ir vs. Ni/Cu, Pd/Pt vs. Ni/Cu, Cu/Pd vs. Pd, and Cu vs. Pd for the peridotites of Pindar attribute to affinity towards komatiite magma, derived from high degree of partial melting of prolonged depleted mantle, and the sulphur saturation condition incurred during the crystallization of chromite which was favourable for PGE mineralization.</p>

				<title>A field technique for rapid lithological discrimination and ore mineral identification: Results from Mamandur Polymetal Deposit, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0093-0106</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work illustrates the efficiency of field spectroscopy for rapid identification of minerals in ore body, alteration zone and host rocks. The adopted procedure involves collection of field spectra, their processing for noise, spectral matching and spectral un-mixing with selected library end-members. Average weighted spectral similarity and effective peak matching techniques were used to draw end-members from library. Constrained linear mixture modelling technique was used to convolve end-member spectra. Linear mixture model was optimized based on root mean square error between field- and modelled-spectra. Estimated minerals and their abundances were subsequently compared with conventional procedures such as petrography, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence for accuracy assessment. The mineralized zone is found to contain azurite, galena, chalcopyrite, bornite, molybdenite, marcacite, gahnite, hematite, goethite, anglesite and malachite. The alteration zone contains chlorite, kaolinite, actinolite and mica. These mineral assemblages correlate well with the petrographic measurements ($R^2 = 0.89$). Subsequently, the bulk chemistry of field samples was compared with spectroscopically derived cumulative weighted mineral chemistry and found to correlate well ($R^2 = 0.91–0.98$) at excellent statistical significance levels (90–99%). From this study, it is evident that field spectroscopy can be effectively used for rapid mineral identification and abundance estimation.</p>

				<title>Intensity attenuation relation at Chamba–Garhwal area in north-west Himalaya with epicentral distance and magnitude</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0107-0122</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seismic hazard assessment of any region depends on the attenuation relation which relates the seismological data with parameters of engineering interest. In the absence of sufficient strong motion data for northwest Himalayan region, isoseismal maps of previous earthquakes were the only source of information for computing the attenuation characteristics of that region. The northwest Himalayan region had experienced major and moderate earthquakes in the past and isoseismal maps had been developed by various authors for each of these earthquakes representing intensity pattern and decay of intensity in different directions. With this information, attenuation relations of intensity with distance can be obtained. The present study includes 10 moderate and major earthquakes ($M_s$ &#8805; 4.9) that had occurred during the last 100 years. These are primarily Kangra (1905), Chamba-1 (1945), Chamba-2 (1995), Kinnaur (1975), Dharamsala (1986), Uttar Kashi (1991), Garhwal-1 (1996), Garhwal-2 (1996), Sundarnagar (1997) and Chamoli (1999) earthquakes. Miezoseismal zones in majority of the isoseismal maps show two major directions, i.e., either the longest axis of these isoseismal maps which are aligned in NW–SE direction following the major longitudinal features or north-northwest to south-southeast direction, following the tectonic features which are transverse to the Himalayan trend. Isoseismal maps of Kangra (1905), Chamba (1945) and Uttar Kashi (1991) earthquakes are more symmetrical and elongated in south-east direction, but compressed in north-east and north-west directions, thus indicating fast attenuation characteristics in north-east and north-west directions reflecting lithological variation. On the other hand, Sundernagar (1997) and Kinnuar (1975) earthquakes show circular pattern of intensity distribution. Combining decay patterns from different magnitude earthquakes in different directions, two attenuation relationships have been developed using regression relationship (least square method).</p>

				<title>Microtremor measurements in the northern coast of İzmir  Bay, Turkey to evaluate site-specific characteristics and fundamental periods by <i>H/V</i> spectral ratio method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0123-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seventy-two microtremor measurements were conducted in the northern coast of İzmir  Bay. The dataset has been processed using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio. The fundamental period contour map obtained showed that the fundamental period at rock sites of the northern coast of İzmir  Bay was between 0.15 and 0.35 s. However, the fundamental period increased towards the western direction where thick soft sediments exist, the fundamental period varied between 0.5 and 2.0 s. A soil classification map of the area was prepared based on the data estimated from SPT-𝑁 values of 25 boreholes. It is seen that major portion of the study area, including the shore line of the northern coast had SPT-𝑁 values lower than 15. The fundamental periods obtained by <i>H/V</i> spectral ratio method and the periods derived from shear wave velocity data available in 11 of 25 boreholes were well-correlated. Fundamental period map obtained from <i>H/V</i> spectral ratio method illustrated the characteristics of weak soil conditions and the presence of bedrock level under thick alluvial soils. Finally, microtremor investigations have proved to be an effective tool for assessment of local soil conditions in case of thick soft sediments in the northern coast of İzmir  Bay.</p>

				<title>Tectonic shortening and coeval volcanism during the Quaternary, Northeast Japan arc</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0137-0147</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Northeast Japan arc, a mature volcanic arc with a back-arc marginal basin (Japan Sea), is located on a convergent plate boundary along the subducting Pacific plate and the overriding North American plate. From a compilation and analysis of stratigraphy, radiometric age and data on erupted magma volumes, 176 eruptive episodes identified from 69 volcanoes so far, indicate that notable changes in eruption style, magma discharge rates and distribution of eruptive centres occurred around 1.0 Ma. Before ca.1.0 Ma, large-volume felsic eruptions were dominant, forming large calderas in the frontal arc, a region of low crustal strain rate. After ca. 1.0 Ma to the present, the calc-alkaline andesite magma eruptions in the frontal and rear arcs, synchronous with crustal shortening characterized by reverse faulting, resulted in stratovolcano development along narrow uplifted zones. Although, it is widely assumed that magma cannot rise easily in a compressional setting, some of the magma stored within basal sills could be extruded where N–S-trending uplifted mountains bounded by reverse faults formed since about ca.1.0 Ma.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Five species of <i>Steginoporella</i> from the Palaeogene rocks of the Western Kachchh, Gujarat are described in this paper. Out of five steginoporellids, <i>S. mathuri</i> n.sp., <i>S. murachbanensis</i> n.sp. and <i>S. chiplonkari</i> n.sp. are new to science; <i>S. bhujensis</i> is already reported from this region; and <i>Steginoporella</i> sp. indet is reported for the first time in these rocks. All these species show Indo-Pacific affinities. The occurrence of <i>Steginoporella</i> from Middle Eocene to Early Miocene indicates that two stages of radiation had taken place in Kachchh. Phylogenetic analysis using PAST programme indicates that <i>S. mathuri</i> is very distinct from other species of <i>Steginoporella</i>; while <i>S. murachbanensis</i> and <i>S. bhujensis</i> form the same clade.</p>

				<title>Late Paleocene–early Eocene carbon isotope stratigraphy from a near-terrestrial tropical section and antiquity of Indian mammals</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0163-0171</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Late Paleocene to early Eocene (∼56 to 51 Ma) interval is characterized by five distinct transient warming (hyperthermal) events (Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), H1/ETM2/ELMO, H2, I1 and I2) in a super greenhouse globe associated with negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs). Although well-documented marine records exist at different latitudes, terrestrial PETM sections are rare. In particular, almost no terrestrial records of either the PETM or early Eocene hyperthermals (EEHs) are yet available from the tropics. Further, evolution of modern order of mammals near the PETM has been recorded in many northern continents; however, the response of mammals in the tropics to these warming events is unknown. A tropical terrestrial record of these hyperthermal/CIE events, encompassing the earliest modern order mammal bearing horizon from India, can therefore be vital in understanding climatic and biotic evolution during the earliest Cenozoic time. Here, for the first time, we report high resolution carbon isotope (𝛿<sup>13</sup>C) stratigraphy, nannofossil, and Sr isotope ratio of marine fossil carbonate from the Cambay Shale Formation of Western India. The record shows complete preservation of all the above CIE events, including the PETM, hitherto unknown from the equatorial terrestrial records. 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C chemostratigraphy further suggests that at least the present early Eocene mammal-bearing horizon, recently discovered at Vastan, does not support the ‘out of India’ hypothesis of earliest appearance of modern mammals and subsequent dispersal to the Holarctic continents.</p>

				<title>Paleoenvironmental significance of clay mineral assemblages in the southeastern Arabian Sea during last 30 kyr</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0173-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A gravity core SK-221 recovered from the southeastern Arabian Sea near Laccadive–Chagos Ridge was examined to identify the sources of detrital clay minerals and to decipher paleoenvironmental changes for the last 30 kyr. The clay mineral assemblages predominantly consist of illite, kaolinite and chlorite with small amounts of smectite. Quartz, feldspar and occasionally gibbsite are the clay-sized non-clay minerals present in the examined section. The detrital clay minerals primarily originated from the hinterland and were supplied to the present site by the numerous small rivers draining western India during preglacial and Holocene periods, and partly by the strong reworking of Indian continental shelf during glacial period. The low values of humidity proxies (kaolinite content, kaolinite to illite and smectite to illite ratios) and better illite crystallinity indicate relatively weak summer monsoon condition that resulted in reduced chemical weathering during glacial period, which was interrupted by a discrete event of winter monsoon intensification at ∼20–17 ka. The increased kaolinite content, higher values of humidity indices and poorer illite crystallinity reflect high humidity that resulted in strong hydrolysis activity during the preglacial and Holocene periods. The increased CaCO<sub>3</sub> during above periods also indicates less terrigenous dilution and intensified southwest monsoon-led upwelling which result in higher surface biogenic productivity. The characteristic clay mineral associations broadly suggest dry to semi-drier conditions during Heinrich Events H1, H2, and H3 and also during Younger Dryas. The low values of biogenic carbonate and organic carbon also indicate low productivity associated with weak summer monsoons during Heinrich Events. Abrupt increased humidity was recorded at 15–12.7 ka (Bølling/Allerød Event) sandwiched between two lows of Heinrich Events. Cycles of millennial timescale variations 2300, 1800, 1300 and 1000 yr have been observed from the clay mineralogical data. All the cycles observed in the monsoonal climate appear to be part of global oscillations.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of OSCAR ocean surface current product in the tropical Indian Ocean using <i>in situ</i> data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0187-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The OSCAR (ocean surface current analysis real-time),which is a product derived from various satellite observations,has been evaluated in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO)in two di ﬀerent ways.First,the OSCAR-derived monthly climatology has been compared with available drifter-derived climatology in the TIO.From the comparison of the two climatologies,one can infer that OSCAR product is able to capture the variabilities of the well-known surface current systems in the TIO reasonably well.Fourier analysis of the major current systems,as reproduced by OSCAR,shows that the dominant annual and semiannual periodicities,known to exist in these systems,have been faithfully picked up by OSCAR. Next,the evaluation has been carried out by comparing the OSCAR currents with currents measured by moored buoys.The zonal component of OSCAR-current is in good agreement with corresponding component of buoy-observed current with a correlation exceeding 0.7,while the match between the meridional components is poorer.The locations of the peaks of the mean and eddy kinetic energies are matching in both the climatologies,although the peak in the drifter climatology is stronger than the same in the OSCAR product.Finally,an important feature of Indian Ocean circulation,namely the reverse Wyrtki jet,occurring during anomalous dipole years,has been well-reproduced by OSCAR currents.</p>

				<title>AIRS observations of seasonal variability in meridional temperature gradient over Indian region at 100 hPa</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0201-0213</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To investigate the temperature changes at 100 hPa over Indian region from Arabian Sea (AS) to Bay of Bengal (BOB), analysis is performed using Atmospheric Infra Red Sounder (AIRS) temperature and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) data of 9 years (2003–2011). Fine-scale temperature variations have been studied and shown for summer (March–April–May, MAM), summer monsoon (June–July–August–September, JJAS) and winter (November–December–January–February, NDJF) months. Similarities and differences in the latitudinal and longitudinal variation of temperature and the possible causes have been examined. During MAM and NDJF, the temperature increases latitudinally by ∼2–3 K and ∼4–5 K from 3.5&#176; to 20.5&#176;N, respectively. However, the temperature decreases by ∼2.0–2.5 K during JJAS. A similar contrasting behaviour is observed in latitudinal temperature gradient. For MAM and NDJF, the gradient decreases from ∼0.18 to ∼0.14 K/deg and ∼0.25 to ∼0.18 K/deg, respectively, as we move longitudinally from 60&#176; to 90&#176;E; however, for JJAS, it increases from ∼0.10 to ∼0.14 K/deg over the same longitudes. It is found that latitudinal temperature gradient for NDJF is larger by about a factor of 1.5. Analysis suggests latitudinal change in temperature occurs due to low OLR (proxy of convection) and its northward progression during summer monsoon. Correlation coefficient (𝑅_xy) between OLR and temperature is computed latitudinally (3.5&#176; to 20.5&#176;N) at different longitudes and during JJAS (monsoon months), 𝑅<sub>xy</sub> is negative (∼−0.73) over 60&#176; and 70&#176;E longitudes, but it turns positive (∼0.92) over 80&#176; and 90&#176;E longitudes (which is convectively active region), suggesting a close association between low temperature and low OLR. Land–sea contrast is also observed in temperature at 100 hPa with a slight increase (∼0.5 K) from sea to land.</p>

				<title>Recent temperature trends at mountain stations on the southern slope of the central Himalayas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0215-0227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Insufficient long-term <i>in situ</i> observations and complex topographic conditions pose major problems in quantifying the magnitude of climatic trends in mountainous regions such as Nepal. Presented here is three decades (1980–2009) of data on annual maximum, minimum and average temperature trends from 13 mountain stations on the southern slope of the central Himalayas. The stations are located at elevations between 1304 and 2566 m above sea level and with varied topography. Spatial analyses of the average temperature trend show warming in most of the stations. The magnitude of warming is higher for maximum temperatures, while minimum temperatures exhibit larger variability such as positive, negative or no change. These results are consistent with patterns reported in some parts of the Indian subcontinent and Upper Indus Basin, but different from conditions on the Tibetan Plateau (China), where the warming of minimum temperatures is more prominent than that of the maximum temperatures. From the temporal variations, a dramatic increase in temperature is observed in the latest decade, particularly in the average and maximum temperatures. The results from the cumulative sum chart analyses suggest that the thermal regime shifted in 1997. The dramatic enhancement of average temperature in the last decade is strongly consistent with the result of contemporary studies of the surrounding regions, where warming is attributed to an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases. However, as in the western Himalayas and the Upper Indus Basin, the mountain stations on the southern slope of the central Himalayas show variability in temperature trends, particularly for the minimum temperature. This inhomogeneous trend is likely ascribed to the differences in topography and microclimatic regime of the observed stations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the observation of indoor air ion concentration at a rural site has been carried out for the first time. These indoor observations are compared with outdoor air ion concentration. Net charge can be introduced into the atmosphere by processes such as combustion, rainfall and ultraviolet radiation. As compared to indoors, average air ions of both the polarities at outdoors are higher. Moreover, the air ion concentrations, experience large fluctuations during daytime, as compared to nighttime values. Positive and negative air ion concentrations are lower and uniform throughout the night both for indoor and outdoor conditions. Pollution index is more or less unity for outdoors in all-the-time period, which is good for human health. Due to limited sources of air ions indoors, it is observed that pollution index decreases from 00:00–02:00 hours and minimum is reached during 12:00–14:00 hours for indoors. During 00:00–02:00 hours, the indoor pollution index is 1.55, which is very harmful to human health.</p>

				<title>Analysis of ENSO-based climate variability in modulating drought risks over western Rajasthan in India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0253-0269</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper investigates the role of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-based climate variability in modulating multivariate drought risks in the drought-prone region of Western Rajasthan in India. Droughts are multivariate phenomenon, often characterized by severity, duration and peak. By using multivariate ENSO index, annual drought events are partitioned into three climatic states – El Niño, La Niña and neutral phases. For multivariate probabilistic representation of drought characteristics, trivariate copulas are employed, which have the ability to preserve the dependence structure of drought variables under uncertain environment. The first copula model is developed without accounting the climate state information to obtain joint and conditional return periods of drought characteristics. Then, copula-based models are developed for each climate state to estimate the joint and conditional probabilities of drought characteristics under each ENSO state. Results of the study suggest that the inclusion of ENSO-based climate variability is helpful in knowing the associated drought risks, and useful for management of water resources in the region.</p>

				<title>Landscape level assessment of critically endangered vegetation of Lakshadweep islands using geo-spatial techniques</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0271-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The conservation of biodiversity is essential for human survival and quality of the environment. Lakshadweep islands are vulnerable to global change and the representing remnant natural vegetation. Landscape fragmentation, disturbance regimes and biological richness have been studied using geo-spatial techniques. Littoral vegetation is the only natural vegetation type of Lakshadweep islands. Altogether 59 patches of the littoral vegetation occupying an area of 137.2 ha were identified. 58.06% of the littoral vegetation patches belongs to the patch-size class of &gt; 5 ha. The remnant natural vegetation surviving with patches of less than 20 ha size indicates severe anthropogenic pressure. The fragmentation of littoral vegetation habitat into smaller isolated patches poses one of the key threats to biodiversity and coastal environment. Phytosociological observations revealed distinct plant communities and presence of invasive species in littoral vegetation. The high disturbance areas accounted for 59.11% area of the total vegetation. The overall spatial distribution of biological richness (BR) in Lakshadweep shows maximum BR at low level (78%), followed by medium (19%), high (2%) and very high (1%). The study emphasizes the importance of conserving the remnant natural vegetation, which is critically endangered.</p>

				<title>Endemism due to climate change: Evidence from <i>Poeciloneuron</i> Bedd. (Clusiaceae) leaf fossil from Assam, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0283-0288</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A fossil leaf resembling <i>Poeciloneuron indicum</i> Bedd. (Clusiaceae) is described from the Late Oligocene (Chattian 28.4–23 Myr) sediments of Assam. The modern analogue is endemic to the Western Ghats which is situated in the same palaeolatitude. Its presence, along with other known fossil records, indicates that the seasonality in temperature was less pronounced and CMMT (cold month mean temperature) was not less than 18&#176;C with plenty of rainfall, in the region during the period of deposition. The study also indicates that the plant phenology is sensitive towards climate change. The present study is in congruence with the global data.</p>

				<title>Palynostratigraphy and depositional environment of Vastan Lignite Mine (Early Eocene), Gujarat, western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0289-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Early Eocene sedimentary successions of south Asia, are marked by the development of extensive fossilbearing, lignite-rich sediments prior to the collision of India with Asia and provide data on contemporary equatorial faunal and vegetational assemblages. One such productive locality in western India is the Vastan Lignite Mine representing approximately a 54–52 Ma sequence dated by the presence of benthic zone marker species, <i>Nummulites burdigalensis burdigalensis</i>. The present study on Vastan Lignite Mine succession is based on the spore-pollen and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages and documents contemporary vegetational changes. 86 genera and 105 species belonging to algal remains (including dinoflagellate cysts), fungal remains, pteridophytic spores and angiospermous pollen grains have been recorded. On the basis of first appearance, acme and decline of palynotaxa, three cenozones have been recognized and broadly reflect changing palaeodepositional environments. These are in ascending stratigraphic order (i) <i>Proxapertites</i> Spp. Cenozone, (ii) <i>Operculodinium centrocarpum</i> Cenozone and (iii) <i>Spinizonocolpites</i> Spp. Cenozone. The basal sequence is lagoonal, palm-dominated and overlain by more open marine conditions with dinoflagellate cysts and at the top, mangrove elements are dominant. The succession has also provided a unique record of fish, lizards, snakes, and mammals.</p>

				<title>Nodular features from Proterozoic Sonia Sandstone, Jodhpur Group, Rajasthan: A litho-biotectonic perspective</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0309-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Sonia Sandstone of Proterozoic Jodhpur Group, Marwar Supergroup, exposed around the Sursagar dam area of Jodhpur town, Rajasthan exposes two varieties of nodular features, often spectacular in shape and size. On the basis of mode of occurrence (intra- or interbed) and stratal involvement (single or multiple) the features are classified as Type I and II. From granulometric and microscopic (optical and scanning electron) studies carried out on sandstones from the nodules and their host sandstones, geochemical analysis (SEM-EDAX) of intragranular cement present within Type I nodules, and appreciation of control of associated fracture system within Type II nodules, it is proposed that the two types of nodules vary in their formative mechanism and stage of formation. While Type I nodules are identified as product of processes operative at the early diagenetic, pre-lithification stage, the Type II nodules are undoubtedly the result of post-lithification origin triggered by formation of fracture system. Here we propose generation of vapour pressure (not exceeding the overlying hydrostatic pressure) by decay of thin, laterally impersistent organic mat as the causal factor for intrabed nodule (Type I) formation, which forced rarefication of local grain packing \tetit {vis-a-vis} early diagenetic silica cementation. The study warrants necessity of more studies on nodules to understand possible roles of organic matter and bedtransgressive fracture systems in their formation, going beyond the generalised secondary mineralization hypothesis.</p>

				<title>Influence of epicentral distance on local seismic response in Kolkata City, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0321-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The influence of source and epicentral distance on the local seismic response in the Kolkata city is investigated by computing the seismic ground motion along 2-D geological cross-sections in the Kolkata city for the earthquake that occurred on 12 June 1897 ($M_w$ = 8.1; focal mechanism: dip = 57&#176;, strike = 110&#176; and rake = 76&#176;; focal depth = 9 km) in Shillong plateau. For the estimation of ground motion parameters, a hybrid technique is used, which is the combination of modal summation and finite difference method. This technique allows the estimation of site specific ground motion for various events located at different distances from Kolkata city, taking into account simultaneously the position and geometry of the seismic source, the mechanical properties of the propagation medium and the geotechnical properties of the site. The epicenter of the Shillong earthquake is about 460 km away from Kolkata. The estimated peak ground acceleration (PGA) varies in the range of 0.11–0.18 g and this range corresponds to the intensity of IX to X on the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) scale and VIII on the Modified Mercalli (MM) scale. The maximum amplification in terms of response spectral ratio (RSR) varies from 10 to 12 in the frequency range 1.0–1.5 Hz. These amplifications occur in correspondence to low-velocity shallow, loose soil deposit. The comparison of these results with earlier ones obtained considering the Calcutta earthquake that occurred on 15 April 1964 ($M_w$ = 6.5; focal mechanism: dip = 32&#176;, strike = 232&#176; and rake = 56&#176;; focal depth = 36 km) shows that the source parameters (magnitude and focal mechanism) and epicentral distance play an important role on site response but the variation in the frequency of the peak values (RSR) is negligible. The obtained results match with observed reported intensities in Kolkata region.</p>

				<title>Comparative analysis of Vening-Meinesz Moritz isostatic models using the constant and variable crust-mantle density contrast – a case study of Zealandia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0339-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compare three different numerical schemes of treating the Moho density contrast in gravimetric inverse problems for finding the Moho depths. The results are validated using the global crustal model CRUST2.0, which is determined based purely on seismic data. Firstly, the gravimetric recovery of the Moho depths is realized by solving Moritz’s generalization of the Vening-Meinesz inverse problem of isostasy while the constant Moho density contrast is adopted. The Pratt-Hayford isostatic model is then facilitated to estimate the variable Moho density contrast. This variable Moho density contrast is subsequently used to determine the Moho depths. Finally, the combined least-squares approach is applied to estimate jointly the Moho depths and density contract based on a <i>priori</i> error model. The EGM2008 global gravity model and the DTM2006.0 global topographic/bathymetric model are used to generate the isostatic gravity anomalies. The comparison of numerical results reveals that the optimal isostatic inverse scheme should take into consideration both the variable depth and density of compensation. This is achieved by applying the combined least-squares approach for a simultaneous estimation of both Moho parameters. We demonstrate that the result obtained using this method has the best agreement with the CRUST2.0 Moho depths. The numerical experiments are conducted at the regional study area of New Zealand’s continental shelf.</p>

				<title>Landslide susceptibility mapping using support vector machine and GIS at the Golestan Province, Iran</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0349-0369</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main goal of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility map using GIS-based support vector machine (SVM) at Kalaleh Township area of the Golestan province, Iran. In this paper, six different types of kernel classifiers such as linear, polynomial degree of 2, polynomial degree of 3, polynomial degree of 4, radial basis function (RBF) and sigmoid were used for landslide susceptibility mapping. At the first stage of the study, landslide locations were identified by aerial photographs and field surveys, and a total of 82 landslide locations were extracted from various sources. Of this, 75% of the landslides (61 landslide locations) are used as training dataset and the rest was used as (21 landslide locations) the validation dataset. Fourteen input data layers were employed as landslide conditioning factors in the landslide susceptibility modelling. These factors are slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, profile curvature, tangential curvature, surface area ratio (SAR), lithology, land use, distance from faults, distance from rivers, distance from roads, topographic wetness index (TWI) and stream power index (SPI). Using these conditioning factors, landslide susceptibility indices were calculated using support vector machine by employing six types of kernel function classifiers. Subsequently, the results were plotted in ArcGIS and six landslide susceptibility maps were produced. Then, using the success rate and the prediction rate methods, the validation process was performed by comparing the existing landslide data with the six landslide susceptibility maps. The validation results showed that success rates for six types of kernel models varied from 79% to 87%. Similarly, results of prediction rates showed that RBF (85%) and polynomial degree of 3 (83%) models performed slightly better than other types of kernel (polynomial degree of 2 = 78%, sigmoid = 78%, polynomial degree of 4 = 78%, and linear = 77%) models. Based on our results, the differences in the rates (success and prediction) of the six models are not really significant. So, the produced susceptibility maps will be useful for general land-use planning.</p>

				<title>An assessment on the use of bivariate, multivariate and soft computing techniques for collapse susceptibility in GIS environ</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0371-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presented herein compares and discusses the use of bivariate, multivariate and soft computing techniques for collapse susceptibility modelling. Conditional probability (CP), logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models representing the bivariate, multivariate and soft computing techniques were used in GIS based collapse susceptibility mapping in an area from Sivas basin (Turkey). Collapse-related factors, directly or indirectly related to the causes of collapse occurrence, such as distance from faults, slope angle and aspect, topographical elevation, distance from drainage, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by means of vegetation cover, distance from roads and settlements were used in the collapse susceptibility analyses. In the last stage of the analyses, collapse susceptibility maps were produced from the models, and they were then compared by means of their validations. However, Area Under Curve (AUC) values obtained from all three models showed that the map obtained from soft computing (ANN) model looks like more accurate than the other models, accuracies of all three models can be evaluated relatively similar. The results also showed that the conditional probability is an essential method in preparation of collapse susceptibility map and highly compatible with GIS operating features.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The RUSLE-3D (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation-3D) model was implemented in geographic information system (GIS) for predicting the soil loss and the spatial patterns of soil erosion risk required for soil conservation planning. High resolution remote sensing data (IKONOS and IRS LISS-IV) were used to prepare land use/land cover and soil maps to derive the vegetation cover and the soil erodibility factor whereas Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to generate spatial topographic factor. Soil erodibility (K) factor in the sub-watershed ranged from 0.30 to 0.48. The sub-watershed is dominated by natural forest in the hilly landform and agricultural land in the piedmont and alluvial plains. Average soil loss was predicted to be lowest in very dense forest and highest in the open forest in the hilly landform. Agricultural land-1 and agriculture land-2 to have moderately high and low soil erosion risk, respectively. The study predicted that 15% area has ‘moderate’ to ‘moderately high’ and 26% area has high to very high risk of soil erosion in the sub-watershed.</p>

				<title>Using artificial neural network approach for modelling rainfall–runoff due to typhoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0399-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In Taiwan, owing to the nonuniform temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall and high mountains all over the country, hydrologic systems are very complex. Therefore, preventing and controlling flood disasters is imperative. Nevertheless, water level and flow records are essential in hydrological analysis for designing related water works of flood management. Due to the complexity of the hydrological process, reliable runoff is hardly predicted by applying linear and non-linear regression methods. Therefore, in this study, a model for estimating runoff by using rainfall data from a river basin is developed and a neural network technique is employed to recover missing data. For achieving the objectives, hourly rainfall and flow data from Nanhe, Taiwu, and Laii rainfall stations and Sinpi flow station in the Linbien basin are used. The data records were of 27 typhoons between the years 2005 and 2009. The feed forward back propagation network (FFBP) and conventional regression analysis (CRA) were employed to study their performances. From the statistical evaluation, it has been found that the performance of FFBP exceeded that of regression analysis as reflected by the determination coefficients $R^2$, which were 0.969 and 0.284 for FFBP and CRA, respectively.</p>

				<title>A modified calculation model for groundwater flowing to horizontal seepage wells</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0407-0418</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The simulation models for groundwater flowing to horizontal seepage wells proposed by Wang and Zhang (2007) are based on the theory of coupled seepage-pipe flow model which treats the well pipe as a highly permeable medium. However, the limitations of the existing model were found during applications. Specifically, a high-resolution grid is required to depict the complex structure of horizontal seepage wells; the permeability of the screen or wall material of radiating bores is usually neglected; and the irregularly distributed radiating bores cannot be accurately simulated. A modified calculation model of groundwater flowing to a horizontal seepage well is introduced in this paper. The exchange flow between well pipe and aquifer couples the turbulent flow inside the horizontal seepage well with laminar flow in the aquifer. The modified calculation model can reliably calculate the pumpage of a real horizontal seepage well. The characteristics of radiating bores, including the diameter, the permeability of screen material and irregular distribution of radiating bores, can be accurately depicted using the modified model that simulates the scenario in which several horizontal seepage wells work together.</p>

					<p>Hydrogeochemical study of groundwater was carried out in a part of the lower Palar river basin, southern India to determine the geochemical processes controlling the groundwater quality. Thirty-nine groundwater samples were collected from the study area and analysed for pH, Eh, EC, Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>3</sub>, Cl and SO<sub>4</sub>. The analysed parameters of the groundwater in the study area were found to be well within the safe range in general with respect to the Bureau of Indian Standards for drinking water except for few locations. The results of these analyses were used to identify the geochemical processes that are taking place in this region. Cation exchange and silicate weathering are the important processes controlling the major ion distribution of the study area. Mass balance reaction model NETPATH was used to assess the ion exchange processes. High concentration of Ca in groundwater of the study area is due to the release of Ca by aquifer material and adsorption of Na due to ion exchange processes. Groundwater of the study area is suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes except for few locations.</p>

				<title>Modelling catchment hydrological responses in a Himalayan Lake as a function of changing land use and land cover</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0433-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, we evaluate the impact of changing land use/land cover (LULC) on the hydrological processes in Dal lake catchment of Kashmir Himalayas by integrating remote sensing, simulation modeling and extensive field observations. Over the years, various anthropogenic pressures in the lake catchment have significantly altered the land system, impairing, \texttit {inter-alia}, sustained biotic communities and water quality of the lake. The primary objective of this paper was to help a better understanding of the LULC change, its driving forces and the overall impact on the hydrological response patterns. Multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data for 1992 and 2005 was used for determining the spatio-temporal dynamics of the lake catchment. Geographic Information System (GIS) based simulation model namely Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) was used to model the hydrological processes under the LULC conditions. We discuss spatio-temporal variations in LULC and identify factors contributing to these variations and analyze the corresponding impacts of the change on the hydrological processes like runoff, erosion and sedimentation. The simulated results on the hydrological responses reveal that depletion of the vegetation cover in the study area and increase in impervious and bare surface cover due to anthropogenic interventions are the primary reasons for the increased runoff, erosion and sediment discharges in the Dal lake catchment. This study concludes that LULC change in the catchment is a major concern that has disrupted the ecological stability and functioning of the Dal lake ecosystem.</p>

				<title>Numerical modelling of seawater intrusion in Shenzhen (China) using a 3D densitydependent model including tidal effects</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0451-0465</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the 1990s, groundwater overexploitation has resulted in seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer of the Shenzhen city, China. Although water supply facilities have been improved and alleviated seawater intrusion in recent years, groundwater overexploitation is still of great concern in some local areas. In this work we present a three-dimensional density-dependent numerical model developed with the FEFLOW code, which is aimed at simulating the extent of seawater intrusion while including tidal effects and different groundwater pumping scenarios. Model calibration, using waterheads and reported chloride concentration, has been performed based on the data from 14 boreholes, which were monitored from May 2008 to December 2009. A fairly good fitness between the observed and computed values was obtained by a manual trial-and-error method. Model prediction has been carried out forward 3 years with the calibrated model taking into account high, medium and low tide levels and different groundwater exploitation schemes. The model results show that tide-induced seawater intrusion significantly affects the groundwater levels and concentrations near the estuarine of the Dasha river, which implies that an important hydraulic connection exists between this river and groundwater, even considering that some anti-seepage measures were taken in the river bed. Two pumping scenarios were considered in the calibrated model in order to predict the future changes in the water levels and chloride concentration. The numerical results reveal a decreased tendency of seawater intrusion if groundwater exploitation does not reach an upper bound of about 1.32 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/d. The model results provide also insights for controlling seawater intrusion in such coastal aquifer systems.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Surface sediments collected from 19 stations along Visakhapatnam harbour were analysed for organic carbon (OC), 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C<sub>oC</sub>, total lipids (TL), total hydrocarbon (THC), 𝑛-alkane concentration and composition. OC, 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C<sub>oC</sub>, TL and THC ranged from 0.6% to 7.6%, -29.3 to -23.8‰, 300 to 14,948 𝜇 g g<sup>−1</sup> dw, and 0.2 to 2,277 𝜇 g g<sup>−1</sup> dw, respectively. Predominance of even carbon numbers 𝑛-alkanes C<sub>12</sub>–C<sub>21</sub> with carbon preference index (CPI) of &lt; 1 suggests major microbial influence. Fair abundance of odd carbon number 𝑛-alkanes in the range of C<sub>15</sub>–C<sub>22</sub> and C<sub>23</sub>–C<sub>33</sub> indicates some input from phytoplankton and terrestrial sources, respectively. Petrogenic input was evident from the presence of hopanes and steranes. The data suggest that organic matter (OM) sources varied spatially and were mostly derived from mixed source.</p>

				<title>Validation of OCM-2 sensor performance in retrieving chlorophyll and TSM along the southwest Bay of Bengal coast</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0479-0489</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Chlorophyll and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) data retrieved from Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) onboard Oceansat-2 were tested for the accuracy using <i>in-situ</i> measurements made along the southwest Bay of Bengal coast during cruises and monthly samplings synchronized with satellite overpass from January 2010 to May 2011. The observed range of <i>in-situ</i> chlorophyll 𝑎 and TSM concentrations were 0.10–4.60 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup> and 12.70–34.56 mgl<sup>−1</sup> respectively, while OCM-2 derived chlorophyll 𝑎 and TSM concentration ranged from 0.324 to 1.552 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup> and 3.537 to 32.11 $mgl^{−1}$, respectively. The <i>in-situ</i> dataset was grouped into low (0.1-0.5 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup>), moderate (0.51-1.0 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup>) and high (&lt; 1 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup>) chlorophyll concentration and low ($12.7–17.81 mgl^{−1}$), moderate ($18.1–29.0 \;  mgl^{−1}$) and high (lt; 30 $mgl^{−1}$) TSM concentration for evaluating the performance of algorithms against different ranges of field measurements. The OCM-2 chlorophyll retrieval algorithm (OC4V4) showed a systematic and large overestimation of low chlorophyll values with $r^{2} = 0.607$, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.33 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup> and mean normalized bias (MNB) = 1.57 and consistent underestimation of high chlorophyll values with $r^2 = 0.497$, RMSE = 1.486 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup> and MNB = 0.52 especially at nearshore waters due to the interference of suspended matter and coloured dissolved organic matter. However, moderate range of chlorophyll values showed better performance of OC4V4 algorithm in chlorophyll retrieval with $r^{2} = 0.676$, RMSE = 0.254 𝜇 gl<sup>−1</sup> and MNB = 0.09 when compared to low and high chlorophyll values. The TSM algorithm (modified algorithm of Tassan 1994) showed large underestimation in TSM retrievals and this was proved by the statistical results which shown maximum $r^{2} = 0.551$ for low TSM values with less RMSE = 0.909 $mgl^{−1}$ and MNB = 0.616 error compared to moderate and high TSM values. OCM-2 retrieved TSM values were not well correlated with <i>in-situ</i> TSM concentration and constantly underestimates four times lesser than the <i>in-situ</i> measurements especially near the coast when TSM concentration was measured high. Though there was significant correlation exists between OCM-2 retrieved chlorophyll and TSM with <i>in-situ</i> measurements, the empirical algorithms employed did not give logical retrieval of both chlorophyll and TSM for the southwest Bay of Bengal (BoB). Thus, the present study revealed that the OCM-2 chlorophyll and TSM retrieval algorithms need to be tested further with extensive <i>in-situ</i> dataset around BoB to improve the regional algorithms for accurate measurements of chlorophyll and TSM in this region.</p>

				<title>Provenance and temporal variability of ice rafted debris in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean during the last 22,000 years</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0491-0501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ice rafted debris (IRD) records were studied in two sediment cores (SK200/22a and SK200/27) from the sub-Antarctic and Polar frontal regime of the Indian sector of Southern Ocean for their distribution and provenance during the last 22,000 years. The IRD fraction consists of quartz and lithic grains, with the lithic grains dominated by volcaniclastic materials. IRD content was high at marine isotope stage 2 but decreased dramatically to near absence at the Termination 1 and the Holocene. The concentration of IRD at glacial section of the core SK200/27 was nearly twice that of SK200/22a. Moreover, IRD were more abundant at the last glacial maxima (LGM) in SK200/27 with its peak abundance proceeding by nearly two millennia than at SK200/22a. It appears that an intensification of Antarctic glaciation combined with a northward migration of the Polar Front during LGM promoted high IRD flux at SK200/27 and subsequent deglacial warming have influenced the IRD supply at SK200/22a. Quartz and lithic grains may have derived from two different sources, the former transported from the Antarctic mainland, while the latter from the islands of volcanic origin from Southern Ocean. Sea-ice, influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is suggested to be a dominant mechanism for the distribution of lithic IRD in the region.</p>

				<title>Characterizing spatial and seasonal variability of carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes above a tropical mixed mangrove forest canopy, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0503-0513</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The above canopy carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes were measured by micrometeorological gradient technique at three distant stations, within the world’s largest mangrove ecosystem of Sundarban (Indian part), between April 2011 and March 2012. Quadrat analysis revealed that all the three study sites are characterized by a strong heterogeneity in the mangrove vegetation cover. At day time the forest was a sink for CO<sub>2</sub>, but its magnitude varied significantly from −0.39 to −1.33 mg m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The station named Jharkhali showed maximum annual fluxes followed by Henry Island and Bonnie Camp. Day time fluxes were higher during March and October, while in August and January the magnitudes were comparatively lower. The seasonal variation followed the same trend in all the sites. The spatial variation of CO<sub>2</sub> flux above the canopy was mainly explained by the canopy density and photosynthetic efficiency of the mangrove species. The CO<sub>2</sub> sink strength of the mangrove cover in different stations varied in the same way with the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake potential of the species diversity in the respective sites. The relationship between the magnitude of day time CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by the canopy and photosynthetic photon flux was defined by a non-linear exponential curve ($R^2$ ranging from 0.51 to 0.60). Water vapour fluxes varied between 1.4 and 69.5 mg m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. There were significant differences in magnitude between day and night time water vapour fluxes, but no spatial variation was observed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Several studies have been carried out on the tropopause, stratopause, and mesopause (collectively termed as ‘pauses’) independently; however, all the pauses have not been studied together. We present global distribution of altitudes and temperatures of these pauses observed with long-term space borne high resolution measurements of Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) and Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) aboard Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. Here we study the commonality and differences observed in the variability of all the pauses. We also examined how good other datasets will represent these features among (and in between) different satellite measurements, re-analysis, and model data. Hemispheric differences observed in all the pauses are also reported. In addition, we show that asymmetries between northern and southern hemispheres continue up to the mesopause. We analyze inter and intra-seasonal variations and long-term trends of these pauses at different latitudes. Finally, a new reference temperature profile is shown from the ground to 110 km for tropical, mid-latitudes, and polar latitudes for both northern and southern hemispheres.</p>

				<title>Recovery curves of the lightning discharges occurring in the dissipation stage of thunderstorms</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0531-0536</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of atmospheric electric field made below two thunderstorms show that all lightning discharges occurring in the dissipating stage of a thunderstorm occur at almost the same value of the predischarge electric field at the ground surface. The observation is explained on the basis of the shielding of the electric fields generated by the positive charge in the downdrafts by the negative charge in the screening layers formed around them in the subcloud layer. Our observations suggest that in the dissipating stage of the thunderstorm, the charge generating mechanisms in cloud have ceased to operate and the charge being transported from the upper to lower regions of cloud by downdrafts is the only in-cloud process affecting the surface electric field and/or enhancing the electric field stress in and below the cloud base to cause yet another lightning discharge.</p>

				<title>Ventilation coefficient trends in the recent decades over four major Indian metropolitan cities</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0537-0549</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thirty years radiosonde data (1971–2000) at 00 UTC for winter months over four major Indian metros, viz., Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai is analysed to study the trends and long term variations in ventilation coefficients and the consequences on the air quality due to these variations in the four metros. A decreasing trend in ventilation coefficient is observed in all the four metros during the 30 years period indicating increasing pollution potential and a degradation in the air quality over these urban centers. In Delhi, the ventilation coefficient decreased at the rate of 49 and 32 m<sup>2</sup>/s/year in the months of December and February, respectively during the 30-year period. In Mumbai, the average decrease in ventilation coefficient in winter months is about 15 m<sup>2</sup>/s/year whereas for Kolkata it is 14 and 17 m<sup>2</sup>/s/year in December and February, respectively. A decreasing trend in ventilation coefficient is observed in Chennai too although it is not significant. The decreasing ventilation coefficient increased the ground level pollution thereby deteriorating the air quality for the urban population. For Mumbai and Kolkata, decreasing mixing depths and decreasing wind speed contributed to the decreasing ventilation coefficient whereas for Delhi and Chennai decreasing wind speed was responsible for the decrease in ventilation coefficient. Further, the pollution potential was much higher in Delhi which is an inland station as compared to Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai which are coastal stations under the influence of marine environment. Compared to Delhi, the pollution potential over these three metros was lower as the prevailing sea-breeze helped in the dispersal of pollutants thereby reducing their ground level concentration.</p>

				<title>Seasonal forecasting of Bangladesh summer monsoon rainfall using simple multiple regression model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0551-0558</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, the development of a statistical forecasting method for summer monsoon rainfall over Bangladesh is described. Predictors for Bangladesh summer monsoon (June–September) rainfall were identified from the large scale ocean–atmospheric circulation variables (i.e., sea-surface temperature, surface air temperature and sea level pressure). The predictors exhibited a significant relationship with Bangladesh summer monsoon rainfall during the period 1961–2007. After carrying out a detailed analysis of various global climate datasets; three predictors were selected. The model performance was evaluated during the period 1977–2007. The model showed better performance in their hindcast seasonal monsoon rainfall over Bangladesh. The RMSE and Heidke skill score for 31 years was 8.13 and 0.37, respectively, and the correlation between the predicted and observed rainfall was 0.74. The BIAS of the forecasts (% of long period average, LPA) was −0.85 and Hit score was 58%. The experimental forecasts for the year 2008 summer monsoon rainfall based on the model were also found to be in good agreement with the observation.</p>

				<title>Integration of speckle de-noising and image segmentation using Synthetic Aperture Radar image for flood extent extraction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0559-0572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Flood is one of the detrimental hydro-meteorological threats to mankind. This compels very efficient flood assessment models. In this paper, we propose remote sensing based flood assessment using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image because of its imperviousness to unfavourable weather conditions. However, they suffer from the speckle noise. Hence, the processing of SAR image is applied in two stages: speckle removal filters and image segmentation methods for flood mapping. The speckle noise has been reduced with the help of Lee, Frost and Gamma MAP filters. A performance comparison of these speckle removal filters is presented. From the results obtained, we deduce that the Gamma MAP is reliable. The selected Gamma MAP filtered image is segmented using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Mean Shift Segmentation (MSS). The GLCM is a texture analysis method that separates the image pixels into water and non-water groups based on their spectral feature whereas MSS is a gradient ascent method, here segmentation is carried out using spectral and spatial information. As test case, Kosi river flood is considered in our study. From the segmentation result of both these methods are comprehensively analysed and concluded that the MSS is efficient for flood mapping.</p>

				<title>Large scale features and assessment of spatial scale correspondence between TMPA and IMD rainfall datasets over Indian landmass</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0573-0588</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Daily rainfall datasets of 10 years (1998–2007) of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) version 6 and India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded rain gauge have been compared over the Indian landmass, both in large and small spatial scales. On the larger spatial scale, the pattern correlation between the two datasets on daily scales during individual years of the study period is ranging from 0.4 to 0.7. The correlation improved significantly (∼0.9) when the study was confined to specific wet and dry spells each of about 5–8 days. Wavelet analysis of intraseasonal oscillations (ISO) of the southwest monsoon rainfall show the percentage contribution of the major two modes (30–50 days and 10–20 days), to be ranging respectively between ∼30–40% and 5–10% for the various years. Analysis of inter-annual variability shows the satellite data to be underestimating seasonal rainfall by ∼110 mm during southwest monsoon and overestimating by ∼150 mm during northeast monsoon season.</p>
					<p>At high spatio-temporal scales, viz., 1&#176; &#215; 1&#176; grid, TMPA data do not correspond to ground truth. We have proposed here a new analysis procedure to assess the minimum spatial scale at which the two datasets are compatible with each other. This has been done by studying the contribution to total seasonal rainfall from different rainfall rate windows (at 1 mm intervals) on different spatial scales (at daily time scale). The compatibility spatial scale is seen to be beyond 5&#176; &#215; 5&#176; average spatial scale over the Indian landmass. This will help to decide the usability of TMPA products, if averaged at appropriate spatial scales, for specific process studies, e.g., cloud scale, meso scale or synoptic scale.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of official tropical cyclone track forecast over north Indian Ocean issued by India Meteorological Department</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0589-0601</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India Meteorological Department (IMD) introduced the objective tropical cyclone (TC) track forecast valid for next 24 hr over the north Indian Ocean (NIO) in 2003. It further extended the validity period up to 72 hr in 2009. Here an attempt is made to evaluate the TC track forecast issued by IMD during 2003–2011 (9 years) by calculating the direct position error (DPE) and skill in track forecast. The accuracy of TC track forecast has been analysed with respect to basin of formation (Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and NIO as whole), season of formation (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons), intensity of TCs (cyclonic storm and severe cyclonic storm or higher intensities) and type of track of TCs (climatological/straight moving and recurving/looping type). The average DPE is about 140, 262 and 386 km and skill is about 27%, 39% and 50%, respectively for 24, 48 and 72 hr forecasts over the NIO as a whole during 2009–2011. Though the DPE is higher and skill is less as compared to those in northwest Pacific and north Atlantic Ocean, the rate of decrease (increase) in DPE (skill) is higher over the NIO in recent years. The DPE (skill) over the NIO has decreased (increased) at the rate of about 7.3 km (3%) per year during 2003–2011 for 24 hr forecasts.</p>

				<title>Observation of wave generation and non-local perturbations in the atmosphere during the passage of a typhoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0603-0612</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During the passage of typhoon Kujira in April 2003 near to the northeast of Taiwan, atmospheric radar at Chung-Li (24&#176; 58&#8242;N, 121&#176; 11&#8242;E) was continuously operated. The data collected from profiler radar was used to investigate the impact of typhoon on generating waves and other atmospheric disturbances. Result showed that the typhoon and the associated wind disturbances can generate atmospheric waves with varied periodicity even when the core was far away from the land. The waves were quite prominent when the core was closer to the mountain. Observations show that these waves propagate vertically upward for many kilometers and getting trapped in higher altitudes. The radar reflectivity at the tropopause during the event showed that stable layer structure was very weak. Further, the enhancement in ozone measurement at the ground level was observed when the typhoon was near to radar site.</p>

				<title>On rising temperature trends at Dehradun in Doon valley of Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0613-0622</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Climate change is one of the most important issues among researchers, scientists, planners and politicians in the present times. Of all the climatic elements, temperature plays a major role in detecting climatic change brought about by urbanization and industrialization. This paper, therefore, attempts to study the temperature changes at Dehradun city by analyzing the time series data of annual maximum, minimum and mean temperature from 1967 to 2007. Data for the study has been analyzed in three parts by running linear regression and by taking anomalies for the whole period from 1967 to 2007, phase one 1967–1987 and phase two 1988–2007. The study of linear trend indicated increasing trends in annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperatures. During 1967–2007 annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperatures increased about 0.43&#176;C, 0.38&#176;C and 0.49&#176;C, respectively. The analysis of temperature data in two phases also revealed an increase in annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperature. However, temperature increase in second phase was more pronounced in relation to first phase. During second phase (1988–2007) annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperatures increased about 0.42&#176;C, 0.59&#176;C and 0.54&#176;C, respectively. The perceptible increase in temperature during second phase is mainly attributed to urbanization and industrialization process initiated at Dehradun particularly after becoming the state capital of newly carved out state of Uttarakhand since the year 2000. The analysis also highlight significantly the role of extreme vulnerability of rising temperatures at Dehradun and urban population will constantly be affected by the change in the temperature which controls the comfort level of the inhabitants. Also, the rising temperatures in Doon valley are not a healthy signature for crop production and water resources in the region.</p>

				<title>An experimental set-up for carbon isotopic analysis of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and an example of ecosystem response during solar eclipse 2010</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0623-0638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here, an experimental set-up developed for the first time in India for the determination of mixing ratio and carbon isotopic ratio of air-CO<sub>2</sub>. The set-up includes traps for collection and extraction of CO<sub>2</sub> from air samples using cryogenic procedures, followed by the measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> mixing ratio using an MKS Baratron gauge and analysis of isotopic ratios using the dual inlet peripheral of a high sensitivity isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) MAT 253. The internal reproducibility (precision) for the 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C measurement is established based on repeat analyses of CO<sub>2</sub> ± 0.03‰. The set-up is calibrated with international carbonate and air-CO<sub>2</sub> standards. An in-house air-CO<sub>2</sub> mixture, ‘OASIS AIRMIX’ is prepared mixing CO<sub>2</sub> from a high purity cylinder with O<sub>2</sub> and $N_2$ and an aliquot of this mixture is routinely analyzed together with the air samples. The external reproducibility for the measurement of the CO<sub>2</sub> mixing ratio and carbon isotopic ratios are ± 7 ($n = 169$) 𝜇 mol·mol<sup>−1</sup> and ± 0.05 ($n = 169$)‰  based on the mean of the difference between two aliquots of reference air mixture analyzed during daily operation carried out during November 2009–December 2011. The correction due to the isobaric interference of $N_{2}O$ on air-CO<sub>2</sub> samples is determined separately by analyzing mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> (of known isotopic composition) and N<sub>2</sub>O in varying proportions. A +0.2‰ correction in the 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C value for a N<sub>2</sub>O concentration of 329 ppb is determined. As an application, we present results from an experiment conducted during solar eclipse of 2010. The isotopic ratio in CO<sub>2</sub> and the carbon dioxide mixing ratio in the air samples collected during the event are different from neighbouring samples, suggesting the role of atmospheric inversion in trapping the emitted CO<sub>2</sub> from the urban atmosphere during the eclipse.</p>

				<title>Detecting changes in rainfall pattern and seasonality index <i>vis-à-vis</i> increasing water scarcity in Maharashtra</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0639-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Knowledge of mean rainfall and its variability of smaller spatial scale are important for the planners in various sectors including water and agriculture. In the present work, long rainfall data series (1901–2006) of districts of Maharashtra in monthly and seasonal scales are constructed and then mean rainfall and coefficient of variability are analyzed to get the spatial pattern and variability. Significant long term changes in monthly rainfall in the district scale are identified by trend analysis of rainfall time series. The seasonality index which is the measure of distribution of precipitation throughout the seasonal cycle is used to classify the different rainfall regime. Also long term changes of the seasonality index are identified by the trend analysis. The state Maharashtra which is to the northwest of peninsular India is highly influenced by the southwest monsoon and the state is facing water scarcity almost every year. This study will help to find out possible reason for the increasing water scarcity in Maharashtra.</p>

				<title>External field characterization using CHAMP satellite data for induction studies</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0651-0660</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Knowledge of external inducing source field morphology is essential for precise estimation of electromagnetic (EM) induction response. A better characterization of the external source field of magnetospheric origin can be achieved by decomposing it into outer and inner magnetospheric contributions, which are best represented in Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) and Solar Magnetic (SM) reference frames, respectively. Thus we propose a spherical harmonic (SH) model to estimate the outer magnetospheric contribution, following the iterative reweighted least squares approach, using the vector magnetic data of the CHAMP satellite. The data covers almost a complete solar cycle from July 2001 to September 2010, spanning 54,474 orbits. The SH model, developed using orbit-averaged vector magnetic data, reveals the existence of a stable outer magnetospheric contribution of about 7.39 nT. This stable field was removed from the CHAMP data after transforming to SM frame. The residual field in the SM frame acts as a primary source for induction in the Earth. The analysis of this time-series using wavelet transformation showed a dominant 27-day periodicity of the geomagnetic field. Therefore, we calculated the inductive EM 𝐶-response function in a least squares sense considering the 27-day period variation as the inducing signal. From the estimated 𝐶-response, we have determined that the global depth to the perfect substitute conductor is about 1132 km and its conductivity is around 1.05 S/m.</p>

				<title>Delineation of seismic source zones based on seismicity parameters and probabilistic evaluation of seismic hazard using logic tree approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0661-0676</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The delineation of seismic source zones plays an important role in the evaluation of seismic hazard. In most of the studies the seismic source delineation is done based on geological features. In the present study, an attempt has been made to delineate seismic source zones in the study area (south India) based on the seismicity parameters. Seismicity parameters and the maximum probable earthquake for these source zones were evaluated and were used in the hazard evaluation. The probabilistic evaluation of seismic hazard for south India was carried out using a logic tree approach. Two different types of seismic sources, linear and areal, were considered in the present study to model the seismic sources in the region more precisely. In order to properly account for the attenuation characteristics of the region, three different attenuation relations were used with different weightage factors. Seismic hazard evaluation was done for the probability of exceedance (PE) of 10% and 2% in 50 years. The spatial variation of rock level peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) and spectral acceleration (Sa) values corresponding to return periods of 475 and 2500 years for the entire study area are presented in this work. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) values at ground surface level were estimated based on different NEHRP site classes by considering local site effects.</p>

				<title>Insights into the P–T evolution path of TsoMorari eclogites of the north-western Himalayas: Constraints on the geodynamic evolution of the region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0677-0698</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is on the Ultra High Pressure Metamorphic rocks of the Tso Morari Crystalline Complex of the northwestern Himalayas. Five different mineral associations representative of five stages of P–T (pressure–temperature) evolution of these rocks have been established based on metamorphic textures and mineral chemistry. The pre-UHP metamorphic association 1 of Na-Ca-amphibole + epidote ± paragonite ± rutile ± magnetite with T–P of ∼500&#176; C and 10 kbar. This is followed by UHP metamorphic regime marked by association 2 and association 3. Association 2 (Fe&lt; Mg&lt; Ca-garnet + omphacite + coesite + phengite + rutile ± ilmenite) marks the peak metamorphic conditions of atleast 33 kbar and ∼750&#176; C. Association 3 (Fe&lt; Mg&lt; Ca-garnet + Na-Ca amphibole + phengite ± paragonite ± calcite ± ilmenite ± titanite) yields a P–T condition of ∼28 kbar and 700&#176;C. The post-UHP metamorphic regime is defined by associations 4 and 5. Association 4 (Fe&lt; Ca&lt; Mg-garnet + Ca-amphibole + plagioclase (An05) + biotite + epidote ± phengite yields a P–T estimate of ∼14 kbar and 800&#176;C) and association 5 (Chlorite + plagioclase (An<sub>0.5</sub>) + quartz + phengite + Ca- amphibole ± epidote ± biotite ± rutile ± titanite ± ilmenite) yields a P–T value of ∼7 kbar and 350&#176;C.</p>

				<title>Varying frontal thrust spacing in mono-vergent wedges: An insight from analogue models</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0699-0714</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sandbox experiments are used to study frontal thrust fault spacing, which is a function of physical properties within the thrust wedge. We consider three styles of thrust progression in mono-vergent wedges: Style I, II and III. In Style I, frontal thrusts progress forelandward, maintaining a constant spacing, whereas Style II and Style III progression show increasing and decreasing spacing, respectively. The three styles are shown as a function of the following factors: basal friction (𝜇<sub>b</sub>), initial surface slope (𝛼) and basal slopes (𝛽), and surface erosion. For high 𝜇<sub>b</sub> (∼0.46), thrust progression occurs in Style II when 𝛼 &gt; 2&#176; and 𝛽  &gt; 0.5&#176;, and in Style III when 𝛼 and 𝛽 are high (𝛼  &lt; 2&#176; and 𝛽  &lt; 0.5&#176;). Style II transforms to Style I when the wedge undergoes syn-thrusting surface erosion. In contrast, low-basal friction (𝜇<sub>b</sub> = 0.36) gives rise to either Style I or III, depending on the magnitudes of 𝛼 and 𝛽. Conditions with 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 0 developed Style I, whereas Style III in conditions with any non-zero values of 𝛼 and 𝛽. In this case, surface erosion caused the process of thrust progression unsteady, and prompted outof-sequence thrusting in the wedge. This study finally presents an analysis of the three styles, taking into account the following two parameters: (1) instantaneous increase of hinterland thickness (𝛥 H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>e</sub>) and (2) forelandward gradient of wedge thickness (𝛿 H/𝛿<sub>x</sub>). Experimental data suggest that thrust sequences develop in Style II for low 𝛿 H/𝛿<sub>x</sub> and large 𝛿 H<sub>e</sub>/H<sub>e</sub> values and, in Style III as either 𝛿 H/𝛿<sub>x</sub> increases or 𝛥 H<sub>e</sub>/H<sub>e</sub> drops.</p>

				<title>Arc parallel extension in Higher and Lesser Himalayas, evidence from western Arunachal Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0715-0727</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The existence of E–W extensional features from northeast (NE) Himalaya is poorly documented. Our investigation in the western part of Arunachal Himalaya provides evidences of active Quaternary E–W arc-parallel extensional features in the Higher and Lesser Himalayas. They are represented by arcperpendicular normal faults and arc-parallel sinistral strike-slip faults. We discuss the occurrences of these arc-parallel extensional features in terms of oblique convergence and radial expansion models. The partitioning of stress due to oblique convergence is argued based on evidences of left-lateral slip in NEHimalaya, right-lateral slip in NW-Himalaya and absence of translation in the central part. The amount of arc-parallel extension in the hinterland regions is correlated to the amount of radial shortening in the foreland. The computation of arc-parallel extension in the NE Himalayan arc is carried out by defining a small-circle centered at 88&#176; 39&#8242; \pm 0.7&#8242;E longitude and 33&#176; 40&#8242; \pm 0.6&#8242;N latitude having a radius of 770.7 ± 15.1 km, for the segment between 92&#176; 01&#8242; and 95&#176; 16&#8242;E longitudes. The amount of arc-parallel extension estimated is ∼110 km for the NE Himalayan segment. Our result agrees closely with the 104 km extension determined based on geodetically computed extension rate and age of initiation of rifting in southern Tibet.</p>

				<title>Petrography and petrogenesis of some Indian basaltic achondrites derived from the HED parent body: Insights from electron microprobe analyses</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0729-0741</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three Indian achondrites, viz., Bholghati howardite, Lohawat howardite and Pipliya Kalan eucrite and two other achondrites, viz., Bé ré ba eucrite and Johnstown diogenite are studied for their petrography and mineral chemistry. All these achondrites are derived from the HED parent body. Both Bholghati and Lohawat howardites are polymict breccias and contain pieces of eucrites and diaogenites (lithic clasts), pyroxene and minor olivine as mineral clasts, and small proportion of ilmenite and pure iron metal. Eucrite clasts are noncumulate basaltic in nature, whereas diogenite clasts are mostly composed of orthopyroxene with minor clinopyroxene and anorthite. Both howardite samples contain orthopyroxene, pigeonite and augite. Notable characteristics observed in Lohawat howardite include crystallization of orthoenstatite first at a high-temperature followed by ferrosilite, pigeonite olivine and augite from a basaltic melt. Piplia Kalan eucrite is noncumulate, unbrecciated and basaltic in nature and display ophitic/sub-ophitic or hypidiomorphic textures. It contains ∼60% pyroxenes (clinoenstatite and pigeonite) and ∼40% plagioclase feldspars (bytownite to anorthite). The observed mineralogy in the Piplia Kalan eucrite suggests its crystallization from a high-temperature basaltic melt crystallized at low pressure. Two other achondrite samples, viz., Bé ré ba eucrite and Johnstown diogenite are also studied. The Bé ré ba eucrite shows cumulate nature which is probably formed by small-degree melts of ilmenitebearing gabbro, whereas the Johnstown diogenite crystallized from a slow cooling of a Ca-poor basaltic melt derived from cumulates formed from the magma ocean, similar to the origin of the noncumulate eucrites.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The metamorphic evolution of the contact aureole around the Late Paleoproterozoic Jhirgadandi pluton in the eastern part of Parsoi Formation of Mahakoshal terrain, central India represents three distinct metamorphic zones, characterized by definite mineral assemblages. The contact-metamorphic event produced the peak-metamorphic mineral assemblages Bt + Qtz + Alb + Sil ± Cd ± Grt ± Mus ± Kfs in the metapelites of inner aureole, Bt + Qtz + And + Mus + Kfs + Plag ± Cd ± Chl in middle aureole and Chl + Mus + Bt ± And + Alb + Qtz ± Ep + Mt ± tourmaline in the outer aureole. The estimated P–T conditions based on detailed geothermobarometric calculations in the thermal metamorphosed rocks are 690&#176;C/3.4 kbar, 580 ± 15&#176;C and 487 ± 30&#176;C in inner aureole, middle aureole and outer aureole, respectively. The variation in metamorphic condition suggests that the shallow crustal level emplacement of Jhirgadandi pluton is responsible for the overprinting of contact metamorphic assemblages ($M_2$) in the low grade metapelites (regional metamorphism $M_1$) of Mahakoshal Group.</p>

				<title>Petrological and geochemical characteristics of Paleoproterozoic ultramafic lamprophyres and carbonatites from the Chitrangi region, Mahakoshal supracrustal belt, central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0759-0776</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of ENE–WSW trending Paleoproterozoic dykes and plugs of mafic, ultramafic, alkaline and carbonatite rocks intrude Mahakoshal supracrustal belt (MSB), which is a part of the Central Indian Tectonic Zone (CITZ). Best exposures of these intrusions are found in the eastern parts of the MSB, particularly in and around Chitrangi area. Many of these intrusions have greenschist facies mineral composition and show sharp contact with supracrustal rocks. However, igneous textures, such as porphyritic/glomeroporphyritic, are still preserved in the form of partly pseudomorphed olivines, phlogopites and pyroxenes. Striking feature observed in some ultramafic samples is the presence of melanite garnet and rounded or elliptical carbonate ocelli. The petrographic characteristics suggest occurrence of carbonate-rich ultramafic lamprophyres; close to aillikite composition. Coarse-grained carbonatites show hypidiomorphic texture and mostly composed of calcite with appreciable amount of silicate minerals like clinopyroxene, phlogopite and olivine (often pseudomorphed by calcite, amphibole and chlorite). It is difficult to establish any direct genetic relationship between carbonatite and ultramafic lamprophyre samples on the basis of their chemistry; they were likely derived from distinct parental melts. High Mg&#35;(up to ∼78), and high Ni and Cr contents (up to ∼1700 and ∼1100, respectively) and low HREE concentration in few ultramafic lamprophyre samples apparently suggest their derivation from a near-primary mantle-derived melts originated at great depths. Geochemistry and presence of carbonate ocellae in ultramafic lamprophyre samples suggest genesis of these silicate rocks and associated carbonatites through liquid immiscibility, however possibility of their derivation through vein-plus-wall-rock melting model cannot be ignored. A multi-stage veined mantle melting model is suitable in the latter case. It is suggested that early stages of rifting in the Mahakoshal region due to lithospheric thinning caused by possible plume activity provided suitable conditions for the genesis of ultramafic lamprophyre (possibly aillikitic) and carbonatitic melts which ultimately crystallized as dykes and plugs.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry of ultramafic xenoliths in Cenozoic alkali basalts from Jiangsu province, eastern China and their geological implication</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0777-0793</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Twelve ultramafic xenoliths in Cenozoic alkali basalts from Jiangsu province, eastern China have been analyzed for major, trace, Sr–Nd isotopic composition and mineral chemical compositions and the origin of these ultramafic xenoliths is discussed based on the geochemical constraints. Based on classification norms, the ultramafic xenoliths in the present study belong to type I xenolith. The Fo-values of the ultramafic xenoliths range from 90.18 to 92.18. The ultramafic xenoliths have higher MgO content, but lower Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO and Na<sub>2</sub>O contents than those of primitive mantle, indicating that they represent residues formed by different degrees of partial melting from the upper mantle. The enrichment of Rb, Ba, U, Nb, K, La, Ce, Sr, P and Zr of ultramafic xenoliths found in Jiangsu province, eastern China may be related to the CO<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub>O-fluids metasomatism. On the basis of Sr–Nd isotopic ratios, we suggest that the lithospheric mantle beneath the study area mostly belongs to depleted-type mantle but with slightly enriched signatures, indicating the heterogeneous characteristics in the mantle source and the influence of different degrees of fluids-metasomatism on the mantle composition. The equilibrium P–T conditions of the spinel lherzolite xenoliths are: T = 913 ∼1045&#176;C, P = 13 ∼22 kb corresponding to depths of 45–83 km. The P–T conditions suggest that the geothermal gradient of the upper mantle beneath the study area is approximately similar to oceanic geotherm which may be caused by asthenosphere upwelling. We suggested that lithospheric mantle thinning accompanied by asthenosphere upwelling has occurred and a newly accreted and cooled asthenospheric mantle may exist beneath the study area.</p>

				<title>Genesis of iron-apatite ores in Posht-e-Badam Block (central Iran) using REE geochemistry</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0795-0807</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rare earth elements in apatites of different ore types show characteristic patterns which are related to different modes of formation of the ores. Most of the apatite-bearing iron ores are associated with alkaline magmas with LREE/HREE fractionation varying from moderate to steep.</p>
					<p>Iron-apatite deposits in Posht-e-Badam Block (Central Iran) have a high concentration of REE (more than 1000 ppm up to 2.5%), and show a strong LREE/HREE ratio with a pronounced negative Eu anomaly. This REE pattern is typical of magmatic apatite and quiet distinct from sedimentary apatites (phosphorites) which have a low REE contents and Ce negative anomalies. On the other hand, they are comparable to the REE patterns of apatites in Kiruna-type iron ores in different parts of the world.</p>
					<p>The REE patterns of apatites, iron-apatite ores and iron ores are similar and only have different REE contents. This similarity indicates a genetic relation for these rocks. Most of the iron-apatite deposits in Central Iran have similar REE patterns too, which in turn show a genetic relation for all of these deposits. This similarity indicates a similar origin and processes in their genesis. There are some small intrusions around some of the iron-apatite deposits that are petrographically identified as syenite and gabbro. These intrusions also have REE patterns similar to that of iron-apatite ores. This demonstrates a genetic relation between these intrusions and iron-apatite ores.</p>
					<p>The REE patterns of apatites in different deposits of Posht-e-Badam Block iron-apatite ores show an affinity to alkaline to sub-alkaline magmas and rifting environment. The alkaline host rocks of Central Iran iron-apatite ores are clearly related to an extensional setting where rifting was important (SSE–NNW fault lines). A probable source for this large scale ore forming processes is relatively low partial melting of mantle rocks. The ores have originated by magmatic differentiation as a late phase in the volcanic cycle forming sub-surface injections or surface flows. These ores have formed during magmatism as immiscible liquids (silicate and Fe-P-rich magmatic liquids) which separated from strongly differentiated magmas aided by a large volatile and alkali element content. Separation of an iron oxide melt and the ensuing hydrothermal processes dominated by alkali metasomatism were both involved to different degrees in the formation of Posht-e-Badam Block iron-apatite deposits. We proposed that the separation of an iron oxide melt and the ensuing hydrothermal processes dominated by alkali metasomatism were both involved to different degrees in the formation of Posht-e-Badam Block iron-apatite deposits.</p>

				<title>Zircon U–Pb geochronology and geochemistry of rhyolitic tuff, granite porphyry and syenogranite in the Lengshuikeng ore district, SE China: Implications for a continental arc to intra-arc rift setting</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0809-0830</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>SE China is well known for its Mesozoic large-scale granitoid plutons and associated ore deposits. Here, zircon U–Pb geochronological and geochemical data have been used to better constrain the petrogenesis of the igneous rocks associated with porphyry Ag–Pb–Zn deposits in the Lengshuikeng ore district, SE China. The Lengshuikeng rhyolitic tuff, granite porphyry and syenogranite yielded zircon U–Pb ages of 161, 155 and 138 Ma, respectively. The Lengshuikeng granite porphyries belong to calc-alkaline series and show fractionated I-type affinities. The rhyolitic tuffs show almost similar characteristics as the granite porphyries. The engshuikeng syenogranites are all alkali-rich and show A-type affinities. The syenogranites have high contents of high field strength elements such as Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf; with Zr + Nb + Ce + Y contents of &lt; 350 ppm. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns show relative enrichment of LREEs and strong negative Eu anomalies. The Lengshuikeng granite porphyries, syenogranites and tuffs were probably derived from partial melting of underlying Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks with minor addition of mantle-derived magmas, accompanied by fractional crystallization. Detailed petrologic and geochemical data for the Jurassic igneous rocks from the Lengshuikeng ore district imply that during the Late Jurassic, SE China on the southeast of the Shi-Hang zone was a continental arc associated with the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate and that since the beginning of the Early Cretaceous an intra-arc rift has been formed along the Shi-Hang zone.</p>

				<title>Heterogeneity of soil surface temperature induced by xerophytic shrub in a revegetated desert ecosystem, northwestern China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0831-0840</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Variation characteristics of the soil surface temperature induced by shrub canopy greatly affects the nearsurface biological and biochemical processes in desert ecosystems. However, information regarding the effects of shrub upon the heterogeneity of soil surface temperature is scarce. Here we aimed to characterize the effects of shrub (<i>Caragana korshinskii</i>) canopy on the soil surface temperature heterogeneity at areas under shrub canopy and the neighbouring bare ground. Diurnal variations of soil surface temperature were measured at areas adjacent to the shrub base (ASB), beneath the midcanopy (BMC), and in the bare intershrub spaces (BIS) at the eastern, southern, western and northern aspects of shrub, respectively. Results indicated that diurnal mean soil surface temperature under the <i>C. korshinskii</i> canopy (ASB and BMC) was significantly lower than in the BIS, with the highest in the BIS, followed by the BMC and ASB. The diurnal maximum and diurnal variations of soil surface temperatures under canopy vary strongly with different aspects of shrub with the diurnal variation in solar altitude, which could be used as cues to detect safe sites for under-canopy biota. A significant empirical linear relationship was found between soil surface temperature and solar altitude, suggesting an empirical predicator that solar altitude can serve for soil surface temperature. Lower soil surface temperatures under the canopy than in the bare intershrub spaces imply that shrubs canopy play a role of ‘cool islands’ in the daytime in terms of soil surface temperature during hot summer months in the desert ecosystems characterized by a mosaic of sparse vegetation and bare ground.</p>

				<title>Characterization of weathering profile in granites and volcanosedimentary rocks in West Africa under humid tropical climate conditions. Case of the Dimbokro Catchment (Ivory Coast)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0841-0854</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In granitic rocks, various models of weathering profile have been proposed, but never for the hard rocks of West Africa. Besides, in the literature there is no description of the weathering profile in volcanosedimentrary rocks. Therefore, we propose three models describing the weathering profiles in granites, metasediments, and volcanic rocks for hard rock formations located in West Africa. For each of these models proposed for granitic and volcano sedimentary rocks of the Dimbokro catchment, vertical layered weathering profiles are described, according to the various weathering and erosion cycles (specific to West Africa) that the geological formations of the Dimbokro catchment experienced from the Eocene to the recent Quaternary period. The characterization of weathering profiles is based on: i) bedrocks and weathering profile observations at outcrop, and ii) interpretation and synthesis of geophysical data and lithologs from different boreholes. For each of the geological formations (granites, metasediments, and volcanic rocks), their related weathering profile model depicted from top to bottom comprises four separate layers: <i>alloterite, isalterite, fissured layer</i>, and <i>fractured fresh basement</i>. These weathering profiles are systematically covered by a soil layer. Though granites, metasediments and volcanic rocks of the Dimbokro catchment experience the same weathering and erosion cycles during the palaeoclimatic fluctuations from Eocene to recent Quaternary period, they exhibit differences in thickness. In granites, the weathering profile is relatively thin due to the absence of iron crust which protects weathering products against dismantling. In metasediments and volcanic rocks iron crusts develop better than in granites; in these rocks the <i>alterite</i> are more resistant to dismantling.</p>

				<title>Hydrogeochemistry and groundwater quality assessment of Ranipet industrial area, Tamil Nadu, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0855-0867</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the highly polluted areas in India located at Ranipet occupies around 200 tanneries and other small scale chemical industries. Partially treated industrial effluents combined with sewage and other wastes discharged on the surface cause severe groundwater pollution in the industrial belt. This poses a problem of supply of safe drinking water in the rural parts of the country. A study was carried out to assess the groundwater pollution and identify major variables affecting the groundwater quality in Ranipet industrial area. Twenty five wells were monitored during pre- and post-monsoon in 2008 and analyzed for the major physico-chemical variables. The water quality variables such as total dissolved solids (TDS), Iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), Hexavalent Chromium (Cr<sup>6+</sup>), at most of the sampling locations exceeded the ISI and WHO guideline levels for drinking water. Multivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis were applied to identify the major factors (variables) corresponding to the different source of variation in groundwater quality. The water quality of groundwater is influenced by both anthropogenic and chemical weathering. The most serious pollution threat to groundwater is from TDS, Cr<sup>6+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, which are associated with sewage and pollution of tannery waste. The study reveals that the groundwater quality changed due to anthropogenic and natural influences such as agricultural, natural weathering process.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of topographic index in relation to terrain roughness and DEM grid spacing</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0869-0886</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Topographic index is an important attribute of digital elevation model (DEM) which indicates soil saturation. It is used for estimation of run-off, soil moisture, depth of ground water and hydrological simulation. Topographic index is derived from DEMs; hence the accuracy of DEM influences its computation. Commonly the raster based grid DEM is widely used to simulate hydrological model parameter, and accuracy varies with respect to DEM grid size and morphological characteristics of terrain. In this study topographic index is evaluated in terms of DEM grid size and terrain roughness. The study was carried out on four small watersheds, having different roughness characteristics, located over the Himalayan terrain. Topographic index surface is derived for each watershed from different grid spacing DEM (10–150 m), analysed and validated. It is found that DEM grid spacing affects the topographic index. The surface representation is smooth in the coarse grid spacing and the pattern of topographic index changes with grid spacing. The spatial autocorrelation of topographic index surface reduces when calculated from larger spacing DEM. The mean of the topographic index surface increases and standard deviation decreases with the increase of grid spacing and the effect is more pronounced in the rough terrain. Accuracy of the topographic index is also evaluated with respect to grid spacing and terrain roughness by comparing the topographic index surface with respect to reference data (10 m grid spacing topographic index surface). The RMSE and mean error of topographic index surface increases in larger grid spacing and the effect is more in rugged terrain.</p>

				<title>Delineation of groundwater potential zone: An AHP/ANP approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0887-0898</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sustainable development and management of groundwater resource requires precise quantitative assessment based on scientific principle and modern techniques. In the present study, groundwater potential zone are delineated using remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques in Unnao district, Uttar Pradesh. The analytical network process (ANP) is a method that makes it possible for one to deal systematically, and includes the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) as a special case. The AHP and ANP are used to determine the weights of various themes and their classes for identifying the groundwater potential zone. These weights are applied in a linear combination to obtain five different groundwater potential zone in the study area, namely ‘very poor’, ‘poor’, ‘moderate’, ‘good’ and ‘very good’. It has been concluded that about 153.39 km<sup>2</sup> area has very good groundwater potential which is only 3.37% of the total study area. However, the area having very poor groundwater potential is about 850 km<sup>2</sup> which is about 19.63% of the study area. The area having good, moderate and poor groundwater potential is about 540.25, 1135.5, 1868.6 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The groundwater potential zone map was finally verified using the well yield data of 37 pumping wells, and the result was found satisfactory.</p>

				<title>Tidal variations in the Sundarbans Estuarine System, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0899-0933</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Situated in the eastern coastal state of West Bengal, the Sundarbans Estuarine System (SES) is India’s largest monsoonal, macro-tidal delta-front estuarine system. It comprises the southernmost part of the Indian portion of the Ganga–Brahmaputra delta bordering the Bay of Bengal. The Sundarbans Estuarine Programme (SEP), conducted during 18–21 March 2011 (the Equinoctial Spring Phase), was the first comprehensive observational programme undertaken for the systematic monitoring of the tides within the SES. The 30 observation stations, spread over more than 3600 km<sup>2</sup>, covered the seven inner estuaries of the SES (the Saptamukhi, Thakuran, Matla, Bidya, Gomdi, Harinbhanga, and Raimangal) and represented a wide range of estuarine and environmental conditions. At all stations, tidal water levels (every 15 minutes), salinity, water and air temperatures (hourly) were measured over the six tidal cycles. We report the observed spatio-temporal variations of the tidal water level. The predominantly semi-diurnal tides were observed to amplify northwards along each estuary, with the highest amplification observed at Canning, situated about 98 km north of the seaface on the Matla. The first definite sign of decay of the tide was observed only at Sahebkhali on the Raimangal, 108 km north of the seaface. The degree and rates of amplification of the tide over the various estuarine stretches were not uniform and followed a complex pattern. A least-squares harmonic analysis of the data performed with eight constituent bands showed that the amplitude of the semi-diurnal band was an order of magnitude higher than that of the other bands and it doubled from mouth to head. The diurnal band showed no such amplification, but the amplitude of the 6-hourly and 4-hourly bands increased headward by a factor of over 4. Tide curves for several stations displayed a tendency for the formation of double peaks at both high water (HW) and low water (LW). One reason for these double-peaks was the HW/LW stands of the tide observed at these stations. During a stand, the water level changes imperceptibly around high tide and low tide. The existence of a stand at most locations is a key new finding of the SEP. We present an objective criterion for identifying if a stand occurs at a station and show that the water level changed imperceptibly over durations ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours during the tidal stands in the SES. The tidal duration asymmetry observed at all stations was modified by the stand. Flow-dominant asymmetry was observed at most locations, with ebb-dominant asymmetry being observed at a few locations over some tidal cycles. The tidal asymmetry and stand have implications for human activity in the Sundarbans. The longer persistence of the high water level around high tide implies that a storm surge is more likely to coincide with the high tide, leading to a greater chance of destruction. Since the stands are associated with an amplification of the 4-hourly and 6-hourly constituents, storm surges that have a similar period are also likely to amplify more during their passage through the SES.</p>

				<title>Low level cloud motion vectors from Kalpana-1 visible images</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0935-0946</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Till now low-level winds were retrieved using Kalpana-1 infrared (IR) images only. In this paper, an attempt has been made to retrieve low-level cloud motion vectors using Kalpana-1 visible (VIS) images at every half an hour. The VIS channel provides better detection of low level clouds, which remain obscure in thermal IR images due to poor thermal contrast. The tracers are taken to be 15 &#215; 15 pixel templates and hence each wind corresponds to about 120km &#215; 120km at sub-satellite point. Multiplet based wind retrieval technique is followed for VIS wind derivation. However, for height assignment of VIS winds, collocated IR image is used. Due to better contrast between cloud and ocean surface, the low level atmospheric flow is captured better as compared to IR winds. The validation of the derived VIS winds is done with Global Forecast System (GFS) model winds and Oceansat-II scatterometer (OSCAT) winds.</p>

				<title>Comparison of CloudSat and TRMM radar reflectivities</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0947-0956</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Comparison of reflectivity data of radars onboard CloudSat and TRMM is performed using coincident overpasses. The contoured frequency by altitude diagrams (CFADs) are constructed for two cases: (a) only include collocated vertical profiles that are most likely to be raining and (b) include all collocated profiles along with cloudy pixels falling within a distance of about 50 km from the centre point of coincidence. Our analysis shows that for both cases, CloudSat underestimates the radar reflectivity by about 10 dBZ compared to that of TRMM radar below 15 km altitude. The difference is well outside the uncertainty value of ∼2 dBZ of each radar. Further, CloudSat reflectivity shows a decreasing trend while that of TRMM radar an increasing trend below 4 km height. Basically W-band radar that CloudSat flies suffers strong attenuation in precipitating clouds and its reflectivity value rarely exceeds 20 dBZ though its technical specification indicates the upper measurement limit to be 40 dBZ. TRMM radar, on the other hand, cannot measure values below 17 dBZ. In fact combining data from these two radars seems to give a better overall spatial structure of convective clouds.</p>

				<title>Cross calibration of INSAT 3A CCD channel radiances with IRS P6 AWiFS sensor</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0957-0966</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indian National Satellite (INSAT) 3A was launched in the year 2003 with communication and remote sensing payloads. The later payloads contain very high resolution radiometer (VHRR) and charge coupled devices (CCD) camera. In this paper, post-launch calibration of INSAT 3A CCD is discussed. A cross radiometric calibration was carried out with well calibrated advanced wide field of view sensor (AWiFS) of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS P6). Three concurrent scenes of December, January and February were used in this study. Calibration was carried out under different land cover classes such as snow, vegetation, forest, water and cloud. Regression analysis suggests correlation coefficient of 0.95, 0.92 and 0.60 for Red, NIR and SWIR channels with slope values 1.839, 1.589 and 2.232, respectively. New calibration coefficients were used to estimate at-sensor radiance and reflectance in all the three channels. Dynamic range of reflectances was found to be improved by using new calibration coefficients. Normalized difference snow index and vegetation index (NDSI and NDVI) have shown an improvement with new coefficients and were found closer to represent <i>in situ</i> data of different land covers and cloud.</p>

				<title>A simple model for post-landfall intensity changes of tropical cyclone over India, Bangladesh and Myanmar coasts</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0967-0977</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using JTWC (Joint Typhoon Warning Center) best track analysis data for the Indian Ocean cyclones, we developed an empirical equation for prediction of maximum surface wind speed of tropical cyclones during first 6–12 hours of landfall along the coastline of Indian subcontinent. A non-linear data fitting approach, the Genetic Algorithm, has been used to develop the above empirical equation using data for 74 tropical cyclones that made landfall on the coasts of India, Bangladesh and Myanmar during the period 1978–2011. For an out of sample validation test, the mean absolute error of the prediction was found to be 5.2 kt, and a correlation of 0.97. Our analysis indicates that time-integration of land area intercepted by cyclones during the landfall is a better predictor of post-landfall intensity compared to post-landfall time span. This approach also helps to tackle the complexity of coastline geometry of Indian subcontinent area.</p>

				<title>Sensitivity of movement and intensity of severe cyclone AILA to the physical processes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0979-0990</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accurate prediction of movement and intensity of tropical cyclone is still most challenging problem in numerical weather prediction. The positive progress in this field can be achieved by providing network of observations in the storm region and best representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model. In the present study later part was attempted to investigate the sensitivity of movement and intensity of the severe cyclonic storm AILA to different physical processes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Three sets of experiments were conducted for convection, microphysics (MP) and planetary boundary layer (PBL) processes. Model-simulated fields like minimum central surface pressure, maximum surface wind, track and vector displacement error are considered to test the sensitivity. The results indicate that the movement of the system is more sensitive to the cumulus physics and the intensity of the cyclone is sensitive to both PBL and cumulus physics. The combination of Betts Miller Janjic (BMJ) for convection, Yonsei University (YSU) for PBL and Purdue Lin (LIN) for microphysics is found to perform better than other combination schemes. The horizontal and vertical features of the system along with its special features like complete northward movement of the system throughout the travel period and the consistent cyclonic storm intensity until 15 hrs after the landfall could be well simulated by the model.</p>

				<title>Lead time for medium range prediction of the dry spell of monsoon using multi-models</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0991-1004</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The purpose of this study is to address prediction of the start date and the duration of breaks in the summer monsoon rains using multi-model superensemble. The availability of datasets from the ‘observing system research and predictability experiment (THORPEX)’ initiated a forecast data archive, called THORPEX interactive grand global ensemble (TIGGE), makes it possible to use forecasts from a suite of individual ensemble prediction systems (member models) and to construct multi-model superensemble forecasts that are designed to remove the collective bias errors of the suite of models. Precipitation datasets are important for this study, we have used high resolution daily gridded rainfall dataset of India Meteorological Department (IMD), in addition to rainfall estimates from tropical rainfall microwave mission (TRMM) satellite and the CPC morphing technique (CMORPH). The scientific approach of this study entails the use of a multi-model superensemble for forecast and to verify against the rainfall information during a training phase, as well as during a forecast phase. We examine the results of forecasts out to day-10 and ask how well do forecast strings of day-1 through day-10 handle the prediction of the onset and duration of the breaks in the summer monsoon rains. Our results confirm that it is possible to predict the onset of a dry spell, around week in advance from the use of the multi-model superensemble and a suite of TIGGE models.We also examine trajectories of the parcels arriving in India in such forecasts from member models and from the multi-model superensemble to validate the arrival of descending dry desert air from the Arabian region during the dry spells and its mode of transition from wet spell. Some phenological features such as a shift in the latitude of the tropical easterly jet and changes in its intensity during break periods are additional observed features that are validated from the history of multi-model superensemble forecasts. Invariably this multi-model superensemble performs better than any single model in proving the better forecasts during our experiment period.</p>

				<title>A note on new indices for the equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1005-1011</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is now well known that there is a strong association of the extremes of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) with the El Ni˜no and southern oscillation (ENSO) and the Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO), later being an east–west oscillation in convection anomaly over the equatorial Indian Ocean. So far, the index used for EQUINOO is EQWIN, which is based on the surface zonal wind over the central equatorial Indian Ocean. Since the most important attribute of EQUINOO is the oscillation in convection/precipitation, we believe that the indices based on convection or precipitation would be more appropriate. Continuous and reliable data on outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and satellite derived precipitation are now available from 1979 onwards. Hence, in this paper, we introduce new indices for EQUINOO, based on the difference in the anomaly of OLR/precipitation between eastern and western parts of the equatorial Indian Ocean. We show that the strong association of extremes of the Indian summer monsoon with ENSO and EQUINOO is also seen when the new indices are used to represent EQUINOO.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of severe thunderstorms studied with the aid of VLF atmospherics over North–East India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1013-1021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electromagnetic waves from lightning activity, commonly known as atmospherics or sferics serve as an effective tool for studying the lower ionosphere as well as thunderstorm activity. It is also useful for locating lightning strokes regionally and globally. In this paper, we present the analysis of the Integrated Field Intensity of Sferics (IFIS) at six discrete VLF frequencies for 30 lightning-associated overhead thunderstorms in Tripura, within the period from August 2009 to October 2010. An ingeniously developed well calibrated GPS locked software VLF receiver, located at the Department of Physics, Tripura University (23.5&#176;N, 91.25&#176;E), is used for the present study. Two distinct types of variations of IFIS, (i) single peak and (ii) dual peak are found characterizing each thunderstorm and their occurrence show nearly inverse character. The spectral character of IFIS rise rate, fall rate and rate of enhancement for each type is studied searching for suitable frequencies in the VLF range to forecast a thunderstorm. It is concluded that VLF sferics from 3–10 kHz are the most effective in terms nowcasting an incoming thunderstorm well before 3–4 hours of its peak occurrence, when there may not be any visual indication of the thunderstorm.</p>

				<title>Fluvial trace fossils in the Middle Siwalik (Sarmatian-Pontian) of Darjeeling Himalayas, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1023-1033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trace fossils that record animal and plant activity are described for the first time from the Middle Siwalik, Neogene deposits of Darjeeling Himalaya. Sedimentary facies association attests to a channel–interchannel floodplain fluviatile setting. The intimate association of the burrows with phytoliths, rhizoliths, leaf compressions and coal lenses suggest that the tracemakers dominated a floodplain habitat. Point bar deposits host a low diversity <i>Planolites-Naktodemasis-Macanopsis-Cylindricum</i> equilibrium ichnocoenosis in the heterolithic fine sandstone-siltstone-shale facies that alternates with dense, monospecific colonization of <i>Planolites</i> as opportunistic pioneers relocating under stressed condition. Interlayered floodplain deposits in the fluvial successions preserve enigmatic large diameter, vertical tubes within thin to thick-bedded, dark silty shale facies. These tubes bear mixed characters assignable to both crayfish burrows and large-diameter rhizoliths. Further work on these tubes is necessary to make more accurate interpretations of those structures. Shallow to moderate burrow depths; intermittent, short-lived colonization events and preservation of rhizoliths and rhizohalos under fluctuating moisture content indicate short-term fluctuations of a relatively high water table (close to the paleosurface) in an imperfectly drained proximal floodplain setting. Ichnotaxa distribution and their inferred ethology provide significant faunal data that may put constraints on the reconstruction of Middle Siwalik depositional environment.</p>

				<title>Platinum-group elements in the Eastern Deccan volcanic province and a comparison with platinum metals of the western Deccan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1035-1044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study is the first detailed investigation of the platinum-group elements (PGE) at the eastern margin of the Deccan volcanic province of India. One of the PGE, osmium, is not included largely because of analytical problems. The study is focused on mafic volcanics and dykes from four areas including Amarkantak, Umaria, Shahdol and Chirimiri. The first two localities represent two lava piles of about 170 and 400 m thickness respectively. In Umaria, 16 flows have been demarcated based on petrography and field studies. The Shahdol samples are basal lava formations overlying Gondwana sediments (Carboniferous) and the Chirimiri samples are dykes. In this study, the western Deccan province is defined as the Western Ghats plus Kutch. On average, the PGE are ∼20% higher in Amarkantak than Umaria and the flows are ∼13% higher in PGE than the dykes. A Zr <i>vs</i>. Pd scattergram found a strong positive correlation for these two elements except for one Umaria sample which indicated severe Pd loss. A comparison of west and east parts of the Deccan volcanic province using primitive mantle normalization showed that higher values prevailed in the western province suite in the Ni-Ir-Ru-Pt region. In contrast, eastern province values dominated in the Pd-Au-Cu region at the ‘Cu’ end of the profiles. A strong dominance of Pd in the eastern Deccan was also of interest. A number of factors, for example, percentage partial melting of the source rock and the temperature and pressure of partial melting strongly influence the character of these profiles. The observed PGE profile characteristics probably result in part from a long distance of subsurface transport of Deccan magma from the western to eastern regions.</p>

					<p>The solution of the static deformation of a homogeneous, isotropic, perfectly elastic half-space caused by uniform movement along a long vertical tensile fracture is well known. In this paper, we study the problem of static deformation of a homogeneous, isotropic, perfectly elastic half-space caused by a nonuniform movement along a long vertical tensile fracture of infinite length and finite depth. Four movement profiles are considered: linear, parabolic, elliptic and cubic. The deformation corresponding to the four non-uniform movement profiles is compared numerically with the deformation due to a uniform case, assuming the source potency to be the same. The equality in source potency is achieved in two ways: One, by varying the depth of fracture and keeping the surface discontinuity constant and the other way, by keeping the depth of fracture constant and varying the surface discontinuity. It is found that the effect of non-uniformity in movement in the near field is noteworthy. The far field is not affected significantly by the non-uniformity in movement. In the first case, horizontal displacement is significantly affected rather than vertical displacement. In the second case, non-uniformity in movement changes the magnitude of the displacement at the surface. Also, the displacements around a long vertical tensile fracture for different movement profiles are plotted in three dimensions.</p>

				<title>A practical solution in delineating thin conducting structures and suppression problem in direct current resistivity sounding</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1065-1080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In hard rock areas, conventional apparent resistivity measurement using Schlumberger resistivity sounding fails to detect thin conducting structures (2-D and 3-D fractures filled with groundwater and mineral aggregate) concealed at a large depth. In the present study, an attempt is made to way-out the detection problem of deep seated thin conducting layer. It is proposed to study the apparent conductance simultaneously with resistivity sounding to detect such conductive zones qualitatively. Apparent conductance is defined as the magnitude of current flowing in the subsurface for a unit applied voltage through current electrodes. Even though such measurement is of qualitative importance, it gives extremely valuable information for the presence of conductive zones at depth in challenging hard rock terrain. It has been observed that apparent conductance increases significantly when groundwater bearing fractures and conductive bodies are encountered in the subsurface. Field data from different locations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of such measurement. The measurement assists to the conventional resistivity sounding for successful prediction of groundwater zones at large depth in different hard rock areas and is of enormous importance. The approach is also used for possible solution of suppression problem in the DC resistivity sounding when intermediate layer is not reflected in the resistivity sounding curve. Finally, the approach can be used together with resistivity sounding to solve many practical problems.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Sandıklı-Hüdai geothermal field is one of the geothermal systems in Afyon and environ, located approximately 40 km southwest of Afyon. The study area consists of volcanic, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Kestel greenschist formation of Paleozoic age forms the basement rock in the area while quartzite which is a member of the Kestel greenschist formation serves as the reservoir rock of Sandıklı-Hüdai geothermal system. Geothermal waters from the study area are classified as Na–SO<sub>4</sub>–HCO<sub>3</sub> type waters. The waters plot along SO<sub>4</sub>–HCO<sub>3</sub> end of the Cl–SO<sub>4</sub>–HCO<sub>3</sub> triangle diagram suggesting same origin for the geothermal waters. 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O and $\delta D$ isotope ratios of the Sandıklı waters plot along the continental meteoric water line, indicating meteoric waters that were unaffected by evaporation. The tritium values imply that the fluids were deep circulating and recharged from older waters. Furthermore, oversaturation of the geothermal fluids with quartz confirms these findings showing long time residence of these groundwaters.</p>

				<title>Hydrogeochemical analysis for Tasuj plain aquifer, Iran</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1091-1105</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigated the hydrogeochemical processes of groundwater in the Tasuj plain, Iran. The Tasuj plain is one of the 12 marginal plains around Urmia Lake which is currently under a critical ecological condition. In the last decades, the Tasuj plain aquifer suffered from severe groundwater level declination and caused degradation of groundwater quality. To better understand hydrogeochemical processes in the Tasuj plain, this study adopted graphical methods and multivariate statistical techniques to analyze groundwater samples. A total of 504 groundwater samples was obtained from 34 different locations (qanats, wells, and springs) over 12 years (1997–2009) and analyzed for 15 water quality parameters. From the results, the Piper diagram indicated four groundwater types and the Stiff diagram showed eight different sources of groundwater samples. The Durov diagram identified five major hydrogeochemical processes in the aquifer. However, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) identified five water types in the groundwater samples because HCA was able to analyze more chemical and physical data than graphical methods. The HCA result was checked by discriminant analysis and found consistency in all samples that were classified into correct groups. Using factor analysis, we identified three factors that accounted for 81.6% of the total variance of the dataset. Based on the high factor loadings of the variables, factors 1 and 2 reflected the natural hydrogeochemical processes and factor 3 explained the effect of agricultural fertilizers and human activities in the Tasuj plain. Dendrograms from 2000 to 2009 were studied to understand the temporal variation of groundwater quality. Comparing the distributions of groundwater types in 2000 and 2009, we found that the mixing zone was expanded. This may be due to artificial groundwater recharge in the recharge area and the effect of inverse ion exchange in the discharge area.</p>

				<title>Identifying desertification risk areas using fuzzy membership and geospatial technique – A case study, Kota District, Rajasthan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1107-1124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Desertification risk assessment is important in order to take proper measures for its prevention. Present research intends to identify the areas under risk of desertification along with their severity in terms of degradation in natural parameters. An integrated model with fuzzy membership analysis, fuzzy rulebased inference system and geospatial techniques was adopted, including five specific natural parameters namely slope, soil pH, soil depth, soil texture and NDVI. Individual parameters were classified according to their deviation from mean. Membership of each individual values to be in a certain class was derived using the normal probability density function of that class. Thus if a single class of a single parameter is with mean 𝜇 and standard deviation 𝜎, the values falling beyond 𝜇 + 2𝜎  and 𝜇 − 2𝜎 are not representing that class, but a transitional zone between two subsequent classes. These are the most important areas in terms of degradation, as they have the lowest probability to be in a certain class, hence highest probability to be extended or narrowed down in next or previous class respectively. Eventually, these are the values which can be easily altered, under extrogenic influences, hence are identified as risk areas. The overall desertification risk is derived by incorporating the different risk severity of each parameter using fuzzy rule-based interference system in GIS environment. Multicriteria based geo-statistics are applied to locate the areas under different severity of desertification risk. The study revealed that in Kota, various anthropogenic pressures are accelerating land deterioration, coupled with natural erosive forces. Four major sources of desertification in Kota are, namely Gully and Ravine erosion, inappropriate mining practices, growing urbanization and random deforestation.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage for disturbance zonation in urban rivers using multivariate analysis: Implications for river management</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1125-1139</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>River pollution has tremendously increased in the major cities of South Asia, where the rivers have become a repository for domestic, agricultural, municipal and industrial wastes. This study presents the evaluation of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage as a means of assessing ecological status, determining different disturbance zones and identifying environmental variables and stressors that deteriorate the river ecosystem. In total, 20 sites in 36-km stretch of the main stem of the Bagmati River and 7 sites on its tributaries were selected for sampling in the post-monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons during the time period 2008–2010. The Ganga River System Biotic Score (GRSbios) index was applied to determine the ecological status. The ecological status of the different Bagmati River stretches ranged from reference, class 1 to class 5 (extremely polluted). We identified three types of disturbance zones along the river, ranging from minimally polluted to extremely polluted. A river corridor survey was conducted to identify any river stressing factors, revealing a sharp deterioration of the river from upstream to downstream with increasing concentrations of chloride and ortho-phosphate phosphorus. <i>Effluents</i> and <i>Activities</i> and <i>Facilities</i> were found to be the major stressing factors to the river ecosystem. The information gained should help water managers find the most time-efficient and cost-effective measures to address river degradation.</p>

				<title>Paleoclimatic, paleovegetational and provenance change in the Ganga Plain during the late Quaternary</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1141-1152</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Present study aims at reconstructing the paleomonsoonal rainfall, paleovegetation and provenance change during the late Quaternary. Towards this, Bhognipur core, collected from the southern Ganga Plain, have been sampled for soil carbonate (SC) and soil. The 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O values of SC (𝛿<sup>18</sup>O<sub>SC</sub>) range from −7.6 to −4.9‰. The variations in 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O<sub>SC</sub> values suggest that during the late Quaternary, the monsoon intensified during MIS 3 and MIS 1 and the maximum lowering of rainfall intensity is observed during MIS 2. The 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C value of SC (𝛿<sup>13</sup>C<sub>SC</sub>), organic matter dispersed in the soil (𝛿<sup>13</sup>C<sub>SOM</sub>) and occluded in the carbonate nodules (𝛿<sup>13</sup>C<sub>NOM</sub>) ranges from −4.1 to +1.4‰, −25.6 to −16.3‰, and −27.7 to −25.0‰, respectively, implies mixed C<sub>3</sub>$–$C<sub>4</sub> vegetation over the Ganga Plain. Variations in 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C<sub>SOM</sub> and 𝛿<sup>13</sup>C<sub>NOM</sub> values at same depth imply preservation problem of pristine organic matter signature. Therefore, it is important to assess the preservation of residual organic matter before using it for paleovegetational reconstruction. The monsoon-vegetation relationship indicates that relative abundances of C<sub>3</sub>$–$C<sub>4</sub> vegetation were mainly driven by variations in monsoonal rainfall intensity. Using <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr in SC, we show that the Himalayan river was supplying sediments in the southern part of the Ganga Plain during MIS 3.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Shell weights of planktonic foraminifera species <i>Globigerinoides ruber</i> in the size range of 300–355 μm were measured from sediment traps in the western and eastern Arabian Sea which represent upwelling and non-upwelling conditions respectively. In the Western Arabian Sea Trap (WAST), <i>G. ruber</i> flux ranged from 33.3 to 437.3&#35;/m<sup>2</sup>/day and shell weights ranged from 6.7 to 14.2 𝜇g. Whereas, in the Eastern Arabian Sea Trap (EAST), flux ranged from 0.7 to 164.6&#35;/m<sup>2</sup>/day and shell weights ranged from 10.4 to 14.8 𝜇g. Shell weights of <i>G. ruber versus</i> flux showed significant correlation at both the sites which reveals that shell calcification mainly depends on optimal growth conditions. Though the WAST and EAST location have distinct difference in pCO<sub>2</sub> and sea surface temperature (SST), the shell weights of <i>G. ruber</i> are similar in these two regions which suggest that surface water pCO<sub>2</sub> and SST do not show dominant influence on shell calcification on a seasonal timescale.</p>

				<title>Gridded daily Indian monsoon rainfall for 14 seasons: Merged TRMM and IMD gauge analyzed values</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1173-1182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Indian monsoon is an important component of earth’s climate system. Daily rainfall data for longer period is vital to study components and processes related to Indian monsoon. Daily observed gridded rainfall data covering both land and adjoining oceanic regions are required for numerical model validation and model development for monsoon. In this study, a new gridded daily Indian rainfall dataset at 1&#176; &#215; 1&#176; latitude/longitude resolution covering 14 monsoon seasons (1998–2011) are described. This merged satellite gauge rainfall dataset (NMSG) combines TRMM TMPA rainfall estimates with gauge information from IMD gridded data. Compared to TRMM and GPCP daily rainfall data, the current NMSG daily data has more information due to inclusion of local gauge analysed values. In terms of bias and skill scores this dataset is superior to other daily rainfall datasets. In a mean climatological sense and also for anomalous monsoon seasons, this merged satellite gauge data brings out more detailed features of monsoon rainfall. The difference of NMSG and GPCP looks significant. This dataset will be useful to researchers for monsoon intraseasonal studies and monsoon model development research.</p>

				<title>Seasonal prediction of Indian summer monsoon: Sensitivity to persistent SST</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1183-1193</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the assessment of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) developed at National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for seasonal forecasting of Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) with different persistent SST is reported. Towards achieving the objective, 30-year model climatology has been generated using observed SST. Upon successful simulation of climatological features of ISM, the model is tested for the simulation of ISM 2011 in forecast mode. Experiments have been conducted in three different time-phases, viz., April, May and June; using different sets of initial conditions (ICs) and the persistent SSTs of the previous months of the time-phases.</p>
					<p>The spatial as well as temporal distribution of model simulated rainfall suggest a below normal monsoon condition throughout the season in all the experiments. However, the rainfall anomaly shows some positive signature over north-east part of India in the month of June and August whereas the central Indian landmass had positive anomaly during August and September. The monthly accumulated All-India rainfall (AIR) over land for June to September 2011 are predicted to be 101% (17.6 cm), 86% (24.3 cm), 83% (21.0 cm) and 95% (15.5 cm) of normal AIR, respectively. This makes the seasonal accumulated AIR 78.4 cm which is 11% below the normal rainfall of 87.6 cm. The model prediction for the months of June and July is comparable with the observation; however, the simulation would not be able to capture the high rainfall during August and September. The intention behind this work is to assess the shortcomings in the CAM model prediction, which can later be improved for future monsoon forecast experiments.</p>

				<title>A new perspective on the infrared brightness temperature distribution of the deep convective clouds</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1195-1206</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We are proposing a statistical technique to analyze the best fit of the histogram of infrared brightness temperature of convective cloud pixels. For this we have utilized the infrared brightness temperatures (IRTB) of Kalpana-1 (8 km resolution) and globally merged infrared brightness temperatures of Climate Prediction Centre NCEP/NWS (4 km resolution, merged from all the available geostationary satellites GOES-8/10, METEOSAT-7/5 and GMS), for both deep convective and non-deep convective (shallow cloud) cases. It is observed that Johnson SB function is the best continuous distribution function in explaining the histogram of infrared brightness temperatures of the convective clouds. The best fit is confirmed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. Johnson SB’s distribution of histogram of infrared brightness temperatures clearly discriminates the cloud pixels of deep convective and non-deep convective cases. It also captures the asymmetric nature in histogram of infrared brightness temperatures. We also observed that Johnson SB distribution of infrared brightness temperatures for deep convective systems is different in each of the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. And Johnson SB parameters are observed to be best in discriminating the Johnson SB distribution of infrared brightness temperatures of deep convective systems for each season. Due to these properties of Johnson SB function, it can be utilized in the modelling of the histogram of infrared brightness temperature of deep convective and non-deep convective systems. It focuses a new perspective on the infrared brightness temperature that will be helpful in cloud detection, classification and modelling.</p>

				<title>Diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal structures due to O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O heating</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1207-1217</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Today with increased availability of data of middle atmospheric winds and temperature, modelling of middle atmospheric tides has acquired greater importance. The theory of atmospheric tides has two main parts: (i) Investigation of the sources of periodic excitation, and (ii) calculation of the atmospheric response to the excitation. Other than stratospheric ozone and tropospheric water vapour absorption, the thermal energy available from the absorption in Schumann–Runge (SR) continuum leading to photodissociation of O<sub>2</sub> is important energy source for tides in the lower thermosphere. PHODIS radiative transfer model is capable of providing tidal forcing due to combined effect of solar and chemical heating in the wavelength region 116 to 850 nm. In this paper, we present an atmospheric tidal model based on classical tidal theory and the prime objective is to obtain the tidal structure due to conventional ozone and water vapour heating in conjunction with the O<sub>2</sub> absorption. Mean wind and dissipation mechanisms are not considered. The present tidal model reveals that the diurnal amplitude peaks in mid to low latitudes, whereas semidiurnal component is stronger at higher latitudes. The semidiurnal tide is about an order of magnitude weaker than the diurnal tide. Also, semidiurnal wave has longer vertical wavelength than diurnal tide. The results of present model are qualitatively in good agreement with the other tidal models, which utilize more sophisticated parameterization. Thus, the salient features of the tidal structure are obtained using basic computations without considering the effects of background winds and dissipation processes. Further refinements to the model can serve as an inexpensive substitute to the presently available tidal models.</p>

				<title>Atmospheric correction of Earth-observation remote sensing images by Monte Carlo method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1219-1235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In earth observation, the atmospheric particles contaminate severely, through absorption and scattering, the reflected electromagnetic signal from the earth surface. It will be greatly beneficial for land surface characterization if we can remove these atmospheric effects from imagery and retrieve surface reflectance that characterizes the surface properties with the purpose of atmospheric correction. Giving the geometric parameters of the studied image and assessing the parameters describing the state of the atmosphere, it is possible to evaluate the atmospheric reflectance, and upward and downward transmittances which take part in the garbling data obtained from the image. To that end, an atmospheric correction algorithm for high spectral resolution data over land surfaces has been developed. It is designed to obtain the main atmospheric parameters needed in the image correction and the interpretation of optical observations. It also estimates the optical characteristics of the Earth-observation imagery (LANDSAT and SPOT). The physics underlying the problem of solar radiation propagations that takes into account multiple scattering and sphericity of the atmosphere has been treated using Monte Carlo techniques.</p>

				<page>1237-1247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, an attempt has been made to develop a decision tree classification (DTC) algorithm for classification of remotely sensed satellite data (Landsat TM) using open source support. The decision tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the spectral distribution of the training dataset using WEKA, open source data mining software. The classified image is compared with the image classified using classical ISODATA clustering and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithms. Classification result based on DTC method provided better visual depiction than results produced by ISODATA clustering or by MLC algorithms. The overall accuracy was found to be 90% (kappa = 0.88) using the DTC, 76.67% (kappa = 0.72) using the Maximum Likelihood and 57.5% (kappa = 0.49) using ISODATA clustering method. Based on the overall accuracy and kappa statistics, DTC was found to be more preferred classification approach than others.</p>

				<title>Monitoring subsurface coal fires in Jharia coalfield using observations of land subsidence from differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1249-1258</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coal fires in the Jharia coalfield pose a serious threat to India’s vital resource of primary coking coal and the regional environment. In order to undertake effective preventative measures, it is critical to detect the occurrence of subsurface coal fires and to monitor the extent of the existing ones. In this study, Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperature Radar (DInSAR) technique has been utilized to monitor subsurface coal fires in the Jharia coalfield. Results showed that majority of the coal fire-related subsidence were concentrated on the eastern and western boundaries of the coalfield. The magnitude of subsidence observed was classified into high (10–27.8 mm), low (0–10 mm) and upliftment (−10–0 mm). The results were strongly supported by <i>in situ</i> observations and satellite-based thermal imagery analysis. Major subsidence was observed in the areas with repeated sightings of coal fire. Further, the study highlighted on the capability of the methodology for predicting potential coal fire zones on the basis of land surface subsidence only. The results from this study have major implications for demarcating the hazardous coal fire areas as well as effective implementation of public safety measures.</p>

				<page>1259-1268</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we report initial results on analysis of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O), and energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat flux) over teak mixed deciduous forests of Madhya Pradesh, central India, during winter (November 2011 and January 2012) and summer (February–May 2012) seasons using eddy covariance flux tower datasets. During the study period, continuous fast response measurements of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and heat fluxes above the canopy were carried out at 10 Hz and averaged for 30 minutes. Concurrently, slow response measurements of meteorological parameters are also being carried out. Diurnal and seasonal variations of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and heat fluxes were analysed and correlated with the meteorological variables. The study showed strong influence of leaf off and on scenario on the CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and energy fluxes due to prevalence of deciduous vegetation type in the study area. Maximum amount of CO<sub>2</sub> was sequestered for photosynthesis during winter (monthly mean of −25 𝜇 mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s) compared to summer (monthly mean of −2 𝜇 mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s). Energy flux analysis (weekly mean) showed more energy being portioned into latent heat during winter (668 W/m<sup>2</sup>) and sensible heat during summer (718 W/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

				<title>Desertification risk mapping of the Zayandeh Rood Basin in Iran</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1269-1282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a classified desertification hazard map of Zayandeh Rood Basin (Z.R.B) in Iran. There are potential climatic factors, the geographical location and human activities for developing desertification. The present study is based on the preview models and main factors of desertification in the study area. The classification method is based on such main parameters as the characteristic of soil, management and climate. Each parameter includes a sub-indicator with a weighing of between one and two based on the MEDALUS model. DEM, LANDSAT images (ETM+), statistical data and vector map are used as the dataset for classifying the desertification map. The sum of score parameters was estimated by using a weighted average. In this study, Arc GIS 9.3 was used to analyze the vector and raster layer maps as well as a recognition survey of the study area using satellite images. In Z.R.B, the most important factors of desertification hazard are the geographical location of the area, salinization area, elevation, slope, and human activities. Thanks to the classification hazard map, the highest class is located on salinization, low vegetation, high wind erosion, low slope and elevation. Low-class area of the hazard map belongs to the largest part of the basin. An important factor of desertification in the area can be the geographical location of the basin located near the desert area. Using the raster data and GIS software are beneficial for the classification hazard map, especially for large areas.</p>

				<title>Stability of aggregates of some weathered soils in south-eastern Nigeria in relation to their geochemical properties</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1283-1294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The stability of some highly weathered soils of the tropics is controlled by their organo-mineral substances. Highly weathered soils from 10 different locations were sampled from their A and B horizons to determine their aggregate stability. The objective of the study was to determine the aggregate stability of the soils and their relationships with geochemical constituents. The major geochemical elements of the soils are quartz and kaolinite, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, while the dithionite extractable Fe and Al was greater than their corresponding oxalate and pyrophosphate forms. The mean-weight diameter from dried aggregates (MWD<sub>d</sub>) and their corresponding wet mean-weight diameter (MWD<sub>w</sub>) were related significantly (r = 0.64*). The dithionite extracted Al and Fe or the crystalline forms of these elements were outstanding in the stability of the aggregates. However, this did not diminish the influence of SOC reduced to third order level in the stability of the soils. The influence of SOC in these soils, however, indirectly manifested on the role of Fe<sub>p</sub> and Al<sub>p</sub> in the aggregation of these soils. The crystalline Fe and Al sesquioxides were very prominent in the aggregation and stability of these soils.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The study described here is based on the measurements of soil gas radon–thoron concentrations performed at Dharamsala region of north-west (NW) Himalayas, India. The study area is tectonically and environmentally significant and shows the features of ductile shear zone due to the presence of distinct thrust planes. Solid state nuclear track detectors (LR-115 films) have been used for the soil gas radon–thoron monitoring. Twenty five radon–thoron discriminators with LR-115 films were installed in the borehole of about 50 cm in the study areas. The recorded radon concentration varies from 1593 to 13570 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> with an average value of 5292 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>. The recorded thoron concentration varies from 223 to 2920 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> with an average value of 901 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>. The anomalous value of radon–thoron has been observed near to the faults like main boundary thrust (MBT and MBT2) as well as neotectonic lineaments in the region.</p>

				<title>Prediction of sediment load by sediment rating curve and neural network (ANN) in El Kebir catchment, Algeria</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1303-1312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The annual sediment load of a river is generally determined either from direct measurements of the sediment load throughout the year or from any of the many sediment transport equations that are available today. Due to lack of a long-term sediment concentration data, sediment rating curves and flux estimation are the most widely applied. This paper has investigated the abilities of statistical models to improve the accuracy of streamflow–suspended sediment relationships in daily and annual suspended sediment estimation. In this study, a comparison was made between suspended sediment rating curves and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the El Kebir catchment. Daily water discharge and daily suspended sediment data from the gauging station of Ain Assel, were used as inputs and targets in the models which were based on the cascade-forward and feed-forward back-propagation using Levenberg–Marquardt and Bayesian regularization algorithms. The model results have shown that the ANN models have the highest efficiency to reproduce the daily sediment load and the global annual sediment yields. Our estimation based on the available data indicated that the areas along the El Kebir River have experienced high sediment fluxes that could have obvious impacts on the sediment trapping and siltation in the Mexa reservoir.</p>

				<title>Formulating the spring discharge-function for the recession period by analyzing its recession curve: A case study of the Ranichauri spring (India)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1313-1323</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Greater Himalayan region is witnessing a changing rainfall pattern from the last few decades. Low-intensity longer-duration rainfall events have now been replaced with intense and shorter-duration events that are further responsible for the reduced recharging of the spring catchments. Consequently, the natural springs are either drying up or becoming seasonal. Prediction of spring water availability during the recession period is the key to its proper management. The spring discharge-rate can be forecasted by studying its behaviour for the past recession periods. Expressing recession curve in mathematical terms requires its quantitative analyses <i>in priori</i>. It was found that the fitting of recession-curve (of the Ranichauri spring under study) with two exponential components gives accurate results. The maximum value of exponential coefficient (i.e., 0.0206) represents the major contribution to drainage from the spring-catchment’s portion with highest permeability, whereas the minimum value (i.e., 0.0016) represents the major contribution to spring discharge from the portion with lowest permeability. Analyses show that the permeability of the porous medium is responsible for discharge rate and its capacity is responsible for perennial or seasonal behaviour of the spring. Using the mean values of the recession parameters, the master discharge-function of the spring for the recession period is formulated for calculating its discharge-rate during the recession period of any year. Apart from the year 2001, its predictions are in close agreement with the actually monitored data. The efficiency of the formulated master discharge function of the spring for the recession period has been evaluated equal to 0.965 using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency criterion.</p>

				<title>Fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the continental shelf waters of western Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1325-1334</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) of southwestern Bay of Bengal surface water during southwest monsoon consisted five fluorophores, three humic-like and two protein-like. The humification index (HIX) and humic fluorophores, viz., visible (C), marine (M) and UV (A) humic-likes indicated, better than biogeochemical constituents analyzed, that the northern-half region of the study area which is closer to the head bay (less salinity) is distinctly more terrestrially influenced. Similarly, the southernhalf region (less dissolved oxygen) is indicated as more <i>in situ</i> influenced. This region is enriched with tyrosine protein-like fluorophore (B), an indicator of bacterial metabolism in some of its samples due to upwelled water. Although chlorophyll 𝑎 is less in this (southern) region, the fluorescence based biological index (BIX) which is an index of recent phytoplankton production is about the same in the two regions, and the lower chlorophyll 𝑎 of southern region is attributed to greater grazing pressure. Fluorescence properties, e.g., BIX are more informative about phytoplankton production than chlorophyll 𝑎.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the effects of microscale chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of coral skeleton on conventional Sr/Ca and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O paleothermometers</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1335-1340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent studies using secondary ion mass spectrometry revealed microscale heterogeneity of Sr/Ca and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O in shallow-water coral skeletons, i.e., Sr/Ca and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O differ significantly between two basic microfeatures of the skeleton: the center of calcification (COC) and surrounding fibrous skeleton (SFS). The COC, in contrast with the SFS, consists of highly irregular crystals intermingled with significant amount of organic matter; therefore, analyzing the SFS only would probably be favourable for paleotemperature reconstruction. Conventional Sr/Ca and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O paleothermometers are, however, based on the analysis of the mixture of the COC and SFS, and thus may be significantly affected by the above-mentioned heterogeneity. In this study, I have evaluated the heterogeneity-induced effects on the conventional paleothermometers of <i>Porites</i> skeletons using published Sr/Ca, 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O and volume-fraction data of the COC and SFS and published observations of seasonal variability of bulk skeletal density. Results indicate that the effects may yield significant or serious errors in paleotemperature reconstruction.</p>

				<title>Further contribution to the low latitude leaf assemblage from the late Oligocene sediments of Assam and its phytogeographical significance</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1341-1357</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An assemblage of fossil leaves is described from the late Oligocene (Chattian 28.1–23 Ma) sediments of Assam, which was located in a low palaeolatitude (∼10$–15&#176;N) during the period of sedimentation. It includes four new fossil leaves resembling <i>Firmiana</i> and <i>Pterygota</i> of the Malvaceae <i>s.l.</i> and <i>Paranephelium</i> and <i>Sapindus</i> of the Sapindaceae. The present study suggests that the floral migration between India and southeast Asia had occurred after the late Oligocene. Our study is in congruence with the earlier published data suggesting a floral migration had occurred after the complete suturing of two landmasses by the Neogene.</p>

				<title>Significance of <i>Lockeia</i> and associated trace fossils from the Bada Bagh Member, Jaisalmer Formation, Rajasthan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1359-1371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A <i>Lockeia-Protovirgularia</i> ichnofauna representing the <i>Cruziana</i> ichnofacies is reported from a calcareous sandstone horizon of the Callovian Bada Bagh Member, Jaisalmer Formation, Rajasthan. The ichnoassemblage is characterized by <i>Lockeia cunctator, L. siliquaria, Protovirgularia ?bidirectionalis, P. rugosa, Ptychoplasma vagans</i> along with <i>Palaeophycus tubularis, P. striatus, Heliophycus</i> isp. And <i>Lophoctenium</i> isp. Use of numerical analysis yielding length to width ratio, slopes and coefficient of determination helps in confirming identification of ichnospecies of <i>Lockeia</i>. Fine morphological details of <i>Lockeia</i> and <i>Protovirgularia</i>, especially sharp and closely spaced chevrons of <i>Protovirgularia</i>, indicate that the substrate in which they were emplaced was stiff, resistant, dewatered and better consolidated. Therefore, it construes that this ichnoassemblage belonging to the classical <i>Cruziana</i> ichnofacies occurs in stiff softground and not a typical softground. Though the ichnofacies of this calcareous sandstone bed indicates low-medium energy condition under subtidal environment of deposition, underlying strata containing <i>Arenicolites, Skolithos</i> and <i>Curvolithus</i> of <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies indicate intertidal sandy shore environment with high energy conditions. Thus, it is concluded that this area was undergoing continuous, gradual deepening. However, the percentage of <i>Thalassinoides, Ophiomorpha</i> and <i>Phycodes</i> in the overlying bed is quite high suggesting an increase in the energy conditions resulting from a probable shallowing.</p>

				<title>Emergence and extinction of Dipterocarpaceae in western India with reference to climate change: Fossil wood evidences</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1373-1386</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Climate has played a crucial role in assigning a different kind of topography to Rajasthan and Gujarat since the Cenozoic time. Evidently, three genera, namely, <i>Dipterocarpus</i> Gaert. f., <i>Hopea</i> Roxb. And <i>Shorea</i> Roxb. of the Dipterocarpaceae are described from the Neogene sediments of western India (Rajasthan and Gujarat). These taxa are marked by their complete absence in the region today. The presence of Dipterocarpaceae in western India has been noticed from the Early Eocene up to the Plio-Pleistocene in deep time. The family is usually a dominant component of the humid tropical and subtropical flora of the Indo-Malayan region and its discovery, along with earlier described fossils from western India indicates existence of ancient tropical rain forests in western India. A change in the climate affected warm and humid conditions occurring there during the Cenozoic resulting in arid to semi-arid climate at present which is responsible for the ultimate extinction of Dipterocarpaceae in the region. In addition, the palaeobiogeography of Dipterocarpaceae is reviewed.</p>

				<title>Density-driven enhanced dissolution of injected CO<sub>2</sub> during long-term CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1387-1397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geological storage of CO<sub>2</sub> in deep saline formations is increasingly seen as a viable strategy to reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, possible leakage of injected CO<sub>2</sub> from the storage formation through vertical pathways such as fractures, faults and abandoned wells is a huge challenge for CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage projects. Thus, the density-driven fluid flow as a process that can accelerate the phase change of injected CO<sub>2</sub> from supercritical phase into aqueous phase is receiving more and more attention. In this paper, we performed higher-resolution reactive transport simulations to investigate the possible density-driven fluid flow process under the ‘real’ condition of CO<sub>2</sub> injection and storage. Simulation results indicated that during CO<sub>2</sub> injection and geological storage in deep saline formations, the higher-density CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated aqueous phase within the lower CO<sub>2</sub> gas plume migrates downward and moves horizontally along the bottom of the formation, and the higher-density fingers within the upper gas plume propagate downward. These density-driven fluid flow processes can significantly enhance the phase transition of injected CO<sub>2</sub> from supercritical phase into aqueous phase, consequently enhancing the effective storage capacity and long-term storage security of injected CO<sub>2</sub> in saline formations.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>1399-1410</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Narmada–Son lineament (NSL) is one of the most prominent tectonic features which divides the Indian peninsula into two subcontinents, northern and southern India since Precambrian times. The area is seismically active and geologically complex with different geological formations. Magnetic data divides the area into two parts and more prominent magnetic highs are observed near Tikwa, Mau and Amarpur regions with 800, 600 and 400 nT, respectively due to the presence of the crystalline basement rock. Tectonic resettlement and lithological changes causes upwarpment of Mahakoshal rocks. In the present study, magnetic data interpretation is carried out for locating depth of causative body and delineating structural fault/dyke boundaries using Euler deconvolution technique. Most of the faults are oriented in the ENE–WSW direction; however, few more faults are identified which are oriented in the SE to NW direction. These fault patterns suggest that the area is exaggerated by tectonic turmoil and distressed both sedimentary to basement rocks isolating the area into numerous faulted blocks. The maximum depths (&lt; 4.5 km) observed at Katni and Umaria area and moderate depths (between 4.0 and 4.5 km) observed towards east of Katni, Ramnagar, Burwa and east of Umaria and Sarna area.</p>

In the mantle, rigidity and initial stress vary linearly while density remains constant. Dispersion relation has been deduced in a closed form by means of variable separable method in the form of Whittaker function. The velocity equation for isotropic layer over a homogeneous half-space has been obtained which coincides with the standard result of Love wave under the effect of rigid boundary.</p>

				<title>The efficacy of support vector machines (SVM) in robust determination of earthquake early warning magnitudes in central Japan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1423-1434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This work deals with a methodology applied to seismic early warning systems which are designed to provide real-time estimation of the magnitude of an event. We will reappraise the work of Simons <i>et al</i>. (2006), who on the basis of wavelet approach predicted a magnitude error of ±1. We will verify and improve upon the methodology of Simons <i>et al</i>. (2006) by applying an SVM statistical learning machine on the time-scale wavelet decomposition methods. We used the data of 108 events in central Japan with magnitude ranging from 3 to 7.4 recorded at KiK-net network stations, for a source–receiver distance of up to 150 km during the period 1998–2011. We applied a wavelet transform on the seismogram data and calculating scale-dependent threshold wavelet coefficients. These coefficients were then classified into low magnitude and high magnitude events by constructing a maximum margin hyperplane between the two classes, which forms the essence of SVMs. Further, the classified events from both the classes were picked up and linear regressions were plotted to determine the relationship between wavelet coefficient magnitude and earthquake magnitude, which in turn helped us to estimate the earthquake magnitude of an event given its threshold wavelet coefficient. At wavelet scale number 7, we predicted the earthquake magnitude of an event within 2.7 seconds. This means that a magnitude determination is available within 2.7 s after the initial onset of the P-wave. These results shed light on the application of SVM as a way to choose the optimal regression function to estimate the magnitude from a few seconds of an incoming seismogram. This would improve the approaches from Simons <i>et al</i>. (2006) which use an average of the two regression functions to estimate the magnitude.</p>

				<title>The South India Precambrian crust and shallow lithospheric mantle: Initial results from the India Deep Earth Imaging Experiment (INDEX)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1435-1453</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here the most comprehensive study of the thickness and composition ($Vp/Vs$ ratio) of the South India Precambrian crust and the nature of shallower mantle inferred from analysis of teleseismic receiver functions from 70 broad-band seismic stations operated as a part of the India Deep Earth Imaging Experiment (INDEX). South India could be broadly divided into regions with thin crust (32–38 km) and thick crust (38–54 km). Thin crust domains include the East Dharwar Craton (EDC), Cuddapah basin and Madurai/Kerala Khondalite Block. The thicker crust domain includes the Western Dharwar Craton (WDC) and northern part of Southern Granulite Terrain. The WDC shows progressive increase in thickness from 38 km in north to 46–54 km in south, compared to an almost flat Moho beneath the EDC. Compositionally, most of the crustal domains are felsic to intermediate ($Vp/Vs$ ∼ 1.69–1.75) except the mid Archean block in the southern WDC where it is mafic ($Vp/Vs$ &lt; 1.81). Considering erosion depth in the WDC, we argue for Himalaya like ∼70 km thick crust beneath it during the Archean. Variation in crustal thickness does not have a first-order influence on regional topography in South India and suggests significant role for the crustal composition. We also present evidence of mid-lithospheric low velocity at ∼85–100 km beneath South India.</p>

				<title>The Sidi Mohamed peridotites (Edough Massif, NE Algeria): Evidence for an uppe mantle origin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1455-1465</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Hercynian Edough massif is the easternmost crystalline massif of the Algerian coast. It consists of two tectonically superposed units composed of micaschists, gneisses, and peridotite. This study concentrates on the small and isolated Sidi Mohamed peridotite outcrop area (0.03 km<sup>2</sup>). The Sidi Mohamed peridotite is composed mainly of harzburgites (Mg-rich olivine and orthopyroxene as major minerals). The Ni (2051–2920 ppm), Cr (2368–5514 ppm) and MgO (∼28–35 wt.%) whole-rock composition and the relative depletion in Nb make these harzburgites comparable to depleted peridotites related to a subduction zone. We suggest that the Sidi Mohamed ultramafic body was derived directly from the upper mantle and tectonically incorporated into the gneiss units of the Edough metamorphic core complex in a subduction environment.</p>

				<title>Ichnology of the Early Cambrian Tal Group, Mussoorie Syncline, Lesser Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1467-1475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Lesser Himalayan sequence is considered as one of the best developed sections of Cambrian successions, exposed in five different synclines. Mussoorie Syncline, being one of the five synclines, exposes the Cambrian Tal Group. This paper describes nine ichnotaxa, viz., <i>Dimorphichnus</i> isp., <i>?Diplichnites</i> isp., <i>Monomorphichnus</i> isp., <i>Nereites</i> isp., <i>Palaeopasichnus</i> isp., <i>Palaeophycus</i> isp., <i>Planolites montanus, Planolites</i> isp., <i>Skolithos</i> isp., <i>Treptichnus</i> isp. from the Dhaulagiri Formation of the Tal Group. A detailed analysis of the ichnofossils indicates that the entire succession of Tal Group reflects shallow marine conditions in general and Mussoorie Syncline in particular. The above ichnofossil assemblage along with earlier ichnofossils and other faunal occurrences substantiates the assignment of Early Cambrian age to the Dhaulagiri Formation.</p>

				<title>An Ediacaran–Cambrian thermal imprint in Rajasthan, western India: Evidence from <sup>40</sup>Ar-<sup>39</sup>Ar geochronology of the Sindreth volcanics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1477-1493</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Sindreth Group exposed near Sirohi in southern Rajasthan, western India, is a volcanosedimentary sequence. Zircons from Sindreth rhyolite lavas and tuffs have yielded U–Pb crystallization ages of ∼768–761 Ma, suggesting that the Sindreth Group is a part of the Malani magmatic event. Earlier <sup>40</sup>Ar-<sup>39</sup>Ar studies of other Malani volcanic and plutonic rocks yielded disturbed argon release spectra, ascribed to a ∼550 Ma thermal event possibly related to the Pan-African orogeny. To test and confirm this possibility, we dated two whole-rock and three feldspar separate samples of the Sindreth volcanics by the <sup>40</sup>Ar-<sup>39</sup>Ar method. All samples yield disturbed argon release spectra suggesting radiogenic argon loss and with plateau segments at 550 Ma or 490 Ma. We interpret these as events of argon loss at 550–490 Ma related to an Ediacaran–Cambrian thermal event, possibly related to the Malagasy orogeny. The combined older and new <sup>40</sup>Ar-<sup>39</sup>Ar results are significant in showing that whereas Ediacaran–Cambrian magmatic and metamorphic events are well known from many parts of India, they left thermal imprints in much of Trans-Aravalli Rajasthan as well. The overall evidence is consistent with a model of multiphase assembly of Gondwanaland from separate continental landmasses.</p>

				<title>High-resolution seismic imaging of the Sohagpur Gondwana basin, central India: Evidence for syn-sedimentary subsidence and faulting</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1495-1505</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gondwana sedimentary basins in the Indian Shield preserve a rich record of tectonic, sedimentary and volcanic processes that affected Gondwanaland. The Gondwana rocks were deposited in the linear rift basins that were formed during Permian–Cretaceous time, similar to their neighbours in Australia, Africa and Antarctica. In this study, we illustrate how Gondwana tectonics affected the Sohagpur Gondwana basin that occurs at the junction of the Mahanadi and Son–Narmada rift systems in the central India, through a high-resolution seismic reflection study along six profiles, covering the central part of the Sohagpur basin. The study reveals (1) ∼1000 m thick, gently dipping Barakar Formation, (2) thick coal seams at a depth of 350–550 m, and (3) NNW–SSE to NW–SE striking steeply dipping normal faults defining rift geometry. These results indicate that the Sohagpur basin contains a thick Lower Gondwana sedimentary succession with a high potential of coal resources and were affected by extensional tectonics. The rift structure in the study area is a syn- to post-sedimentary deformational structure that was formed arguably in response to tectonics that pervasively affected Gondwanaland.</p>

				<title>Model of erosion–landslide interaction in the context of the reservoir water level variations (East Siberia, Russia): Factors, environment and mechanisms</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1515-1531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive investigation of landslide–erosion interactions has been carried out in the local shore geosystem of the Bykovo site located on the left shore of the Bratsk reservoir. The landslide process develops in the Mid-Quaternary grounds ($aQ^{3}_{II}$) of the erosion-accumulative terrace’s fragment that comprises sand, sand with pebbles, sandy loams and loams. This study aims to assess the environmental factors of interacting landslide and gully erosion processes, to estimate their temporal dynamics by comparative analysis of cartographic models based on the data of repeated theodolite surveys, and to find out what level regime of the reservoir stimulates the activation of the landslide process. The authors propose two-stage descriptive model of erosion–landslide interaction and development mechanisms in the context of the reservoir water level variations in the Bratsk reservoir. The activation of landslide processes in the reservoir shores follows the periods of high water level stands. Shore slope stability is disturbed by abrasion of slope foot and inundation of the slide zone. The soils subject to landslide, erosion–landslide and erosion processes differ in their microstructure and properties. Largest erosion susceptibility is typical of soils with skeleton-aggregated microstructure, fine- and coarse-silt sandy loams and loams of high porosity, whose interstructural bonds are attributed to water-soluble salts (Sws = 0.4–0.5%) and high carbonate contents (Scr = 34–66%). High dispersion and aggregation of clay fractions is typical of the loams of the slide zone. The structure of soils subject to deformation slide is represented primarily by fine-sand particles and aggregates with smaller cohesion and strength properties.</p>

				<title>Water level changes of high altitude lakes in Himalaya–Karakoram from ICESat altimetry</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1533-1543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Himalaya–Karakoram (H–K) region hosts large number of high altitude lakes but are poorly gauged by <i>in-situ</i> water level monitoring method due to tough terrain conditions and poor accessibility. After the campaigns of ICESat during 2003–2009, now it is possible to achieve lake levels at decimetre accuracy. Therefore, in present study, high altitude lake levels were observed using ICESat/GLAS altimetry in H–K between 2003 and 2009 to generate baseline information. The study reveals that out of 13 lakes, 10 lakes show increasing trend of water levels at different rate (mean rate 0.173 m/y) whereas three lakes unveiled decreasing trend (mean rate −0.056 m/y). Out of five freshwater lakes, four lakes show an increasing trend of their level (mean rate 0.084 m/y) whereas comparatively six salt lakes (out of seven salt lakes) exhibited ∼3 times higher mean rate of lake level increase (0.233 m/y). These observed lake level rise can be attributed to the increased melt runoffs (i.e., seasonal snow and glacier melts) owing to the enhanced mean annual and seasonal air temperature during past decade in north-western (NW) Himalaya. Further, varied behaviours of lake level rises in inter- and intra-basins suggest that the local climatic fluctuations play prominent role along with regional and global climate in complex geographical system of NW Himalaya.</p>

				<title>Estimation of the soil strength parameters in Tertiary volcanic regolith (NE Turkey) using analytical hierarchy process</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1545-1555</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Costly and time consuming testing techniques and the difficulties in providing undisturbed samples for these tests have led researchers to estimate strength parameters of soils with simple index tests. However, the paper focuses on estimation of strength parameters of soils as a function of the index properties. Analytical hierarchy process and multiple regression analysis based methodology were performed on datasets obtained from soil tests on 41 samples in Tertiary volcanic regolith. While the hierarchy model focused on determining the most important index properties affecting on strength parameters, regression analysis established meaningful relationships between strength parameters and index properties. The negative polynomial correlations between the friction angle and plasticity properties, and the positive exponential relations between the cohesion and plasticity properties were determined. These relations are characterized by a regression coefficient of 0.80. However, Terzaghi bearing capacity formulas were used to test the model. It is important to see whether there is any statistically significant relation between the calculated and the observed bearing capacity values for model testing. Based on the model, the positive linear correlation characterized by the regression coefficient of 0.86 were determined between bearing capacity values obtained by direct and indirect methods.</p>

				<page>1557-1570</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geochemical composition is a set of data for predicting the climatic condition existing in an ecosystem. Both the surficial and core sediment geochemistry are helpful in monitoring, assessing and evaluating the marine environment. The aim of the research work is to assess the relationship between the biogeochemical constituents in the Cochin Estuarine System (CES), their modifications after a long period of anoxia and also to identify the various processes which control the sediment composition in this region, through a multivariate statistical approach. Therefore the study of present core sediment geochemistry has a critical role in unraveling the benchmark of their characterization. Sediment cores from four prominent zones of CES were examined for various biogeochemical aspects. The results have served as rejuvenating records for the prediction of core sediment status prevailing in the CES.</p>

				<title>Oceansat–2 and RAMA buoy winds: A comparison</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1571-1582</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sea surface vector winds from scatterometers onboard satellites play an important role to make accurate Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model analysis over the data sparse oceanic region. Sea surface winds from Oceansat-2 scatterometer (OSCAT) over the Indian Ocean were validated against the Research Moored Array for African–Asian–Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) buoy winds to establish the accuracy of OSCAT winds. The comparison of OSCAT winds against RAMA buoy winds for a period of one year (2011) shows that the wind speeds and directions derived from OSCAT agree with RAMA buoy winds. The monthly mean wind speeds from both OSCAT and RAMA buoy show maximum value during the monsoon period as expected. In the complete annual cycle (2011), the monthly mean root mean square differences in the wind speed and wind direction were less than ∼2.5 m$s^{−1}$ and ∼20&#176;, respectively. The better match between the OSCAT and RAMA buoy wind is observed during Indian summer monsoon (June–September). During monsoon 2011, the root mean square differences in wind speed and wind direction were less than $1.9 ms^{−1}$ and 11&#176;, respectively. Collocation of scatterometer winds against equatorial and off-equatorial buoys clearly brought out the monsoon circulation features. Collocation of Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds on-board European Space Agency (ESA) MeTop satellite with respect to RAMA buoy winds during monsoon 2011 also showed that the OSCAT wind statistics are comparable with that of ASCAT over the Indian Ocean, and indicates that the accuracy of both the scatterometers over the Indian Ocean are essentially the same.</p>

				<title>Upper tropospheric water vapour variability over tropical latitudes observed using radiosonde and satellite measurements</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1583-1591</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study deals with using long-term database for upper tropospheric water vapour (UTWV) variability studies over three tropical stations (Gadanki, Singapore and Truk), where different climatic conditions prevail. Over Gadanki (13.5&#176;N, 79.2&#176;E) strong seasonal variation in UTWV is revealed but not over Singapore (1.37&#176;N, 103.98&#176;E) and Truk (7.46&#176;N, 151.85&#176;E) except at 100 hPa. It is examined whether high resolution radiosonde measurements represent well the UTWV by comparing with different satellite based (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSUB) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)) water vapour measurements. Very good comparison in the nature of variations of UTWV is observed between radiosonde data and satellite data, except over Singapore particularly with AIRS and MLS data, on long-term basis. An attempt is also made to examine the source for UTWV. A close relationship is found between UTWV and deep convection over Gadanki indicating that the source for UTWV is convection particularly during the summer monsoon season.</p>

				<title>Estimating minimum and maximum air temperature using MODIS data over Indo-Gangetic Plain</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1593-1605</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spatially distributed air temperature data are required for climatological, hydrological and environmental studies. However, high spatial distribution patterns of air temperature are not available from meteorological stations due to its sparse network. The objective of this study was to estimate high spatial resolution minimum air temperature (𝑇_{min}) and maximum air temperature (𝑇_{max}) over the Indo-Gangetic Plain using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and India Meteorological Department (IMD) ground station data. 𝑇_{min} was estimated by establishing an empirical relationship between IMD 𝑇_{min} and night-time MODIS Land Surface Temperature (𝑇_{s}). While, 𝑇_{max} was estimated using the Temperature-Vegetation Index (TVX) approach. The TVX approach is based on the linear relationship between 𝑇_{s} and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data where 𝑇_{max} is estimated by extrapolating the NDVI-𝑇_{s} regression line to maximum value of NDVImax for effective full vegetation cover. The present study also proposed a methodology to estimate NDVImax using IMD measured 𝑇_{max} for the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Comparison of MODIS estimated 𝑇<sub>min</sub> with IMD measured 𝑇<sub>min</sub> showed mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.73&#176;C and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.2&#176;C. Analysis in the study for 𝑇_{max} estimation showed that calibrated NDVImax performed well, with the MAE of 1.79&#176;C and RMSE of 2.16&#176;C.</p>

				<title>Deformation and metamorphism of gold-sulphide lodes in the Bhukia–Jagpura gold prospect, Rajasthan: Implications for ore genesis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0013</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The role of polyphase deformation in controlling the emplacement of gold-quartz lodes in dilational regimes is demonstrated from the Proterozoic Bhukia–Jagpura gold prospect in south Rajasthan. Earlier researchers deciphered the gold-sulphide mineralisation event as synchronous to the second phase of deformation (D<sub>2</sub>) without convincing microstructural or metamorphic evidences. In this contribution, we correlate the deformation and metamorphic imprints in the host rocks with those in the gold-sulphide mineralised zone, and present a new interpretation for the relative timing of gold emplacement <i>vis-á-vis</i> deformation. The ore-forming process first involved layer-parallel influx of ore-bearing hydrothermal fluids along $S_1$ schistosity in the host rocks, synkinematic with respect to the first phase of deformation (D<sub>1</sub>). This initial ore concentration experienced metamorphism isofacially (∼500&#176; C at 5.3 kb) along with its host rocks during D<sub>1</sub>, and subsequently underwent extensive remobilisation, giving rise to gold-bearing silicified lodes along the hinges and axial surfaces of F<sub>2</sub> folds during D<sub>2</sub>.</p>

				<title>Ianthinite: A rare hydrous uranium oxide mineral from Akkavaram, Andhra Pradesh, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0015-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ianthinite is the only known uranyl oxide hydrate mineral that contains both $U^{6+}$ and $U^{4+}$. For the first time, we report ianthinite from India (at Akkavaram, Andhra Pradesh), which is hosted in basement granitoids. The mineral occurs in the form of tiny grains, encrustations and coatings in intimate association with uraninite and uranophane. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data reveals that d-spacings of the investigated ianthinite are in close agreement with the corresponding values given for ianthinite standard in International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) card no. 12-272. The crystallographic parameters of the studied ianthinite are: $a_{o} = 11.3$ (1) $Å, b_{o} = 7.19$ (3) Å and $c_{o} = 30.46$ (8) Å, with a unit cell volume of 2474 (27) Å<sup>3</sup>. The association of investigated ianthinite with uraninite suggests that the former has formed due to oxidation of the latter. Since a major part of the uraninite was exposed to oxidizing meteoric water, much of it has been transformed into hydrous uranium oxide (ianthinite) and very little part remained unaltered as uranium oxide (uraninite). Absence of schoepite in the investigated ianthinite suggests that after its formation it (ianthinite) was not exposed to oxygen/oxidizing meteoric water. As the oxidation was partial and short lived, some amount of primary uraninite is also preserved.</p>

				<title>Growth of the Afanasy Nikitin seamount and its relationship with the 85&#176;E  Ridge, northeastern Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0033-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Afanasy Nikitin seamount (ANS) is a major structural feature (400 km-long and 150 km-wide) in the Central Indian Basin, situated at the southern end of the so-called 85&#176;E  Ridge. Combined analyses of new multibeam bathymetric, seismic reflection and geochronological data together with previously described magnetic data provide new insights into the growth of the ANS through time, and its relationship with the 85&#176;E  Ridge. The ANS comprises a main plateau, rising 1200 m above the surrounding ocean floor (4800 m), and secondary elevated seamount highs, two of which (lie at 1600 and 2050 m water depths) have the morphology of a guyot, suggesting that they were formed above or close to sea-level. An unbroken sequence of spreading anomalies 34 through 32n.1 identified over the ANS reveal that the main plateau of the ANS was formed at 80–73 Ma, at around the same time as that of the underlying oceanic crust. The <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar dates for two basalt samples dredged from the seamount highs are consistent, within error, at 67 Ma. These results, together with published results of late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic Indian Ocean plate reconstructions, indicate that the Conrad Rise hotspot emplaced both the main plateau of the ANS and Conrad Rise (including the Marion Dufresne, Ob and Lena seamounts) at 80–73 Ma, close to the India–Antarctica Ridge system. Subsequently, the seamount highs were formed by late-stage volcanism c. 6–13 Myr after the main constructional phase of the seamount plateau. Flexural analysis indicates that the main plateau and seamount highs of the ANS are consistent with Airy-type isostatic compensation, which suggest emplacement of the entire seamount in a near spreading-center setting. This is contrary to the flexural compensation of the 85&#176;E  Ridge further north, which is interpreted as being emplaced in an intraplate setting, i.e., 25–35 Myr later than the underlying oceanic crust. Therefore, we suggest that the ANS and the 85&#176;E  Ridge appear to be unrelated as they were formed by different mantle sources, and that the proximity of the southern end of the 85&#176;E  Ridge to the ANS is coincidental.</p>

				<title>Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment of Himachal Pradesh and adjoining regions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0049-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seismically active Himachal Pradesh and adjoining regions comprising Himalayan orogenic belt with the experience of the great Kangra earthquake of 1905, has high potential for river valley projects. There are already operating hydropower projects, some under construction and a few more coming up. In view of this it is important to know the ground motion nature for various locales. The present study is about estimation of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) for the state of Himachal Pradesh and adjoining regions using probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) approach. Standard procedure for PSHA has been adopted for this study and peak ground motion has been estimated for 10% and 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years at the bed rock level considering two cases: (i) varying 𝑏-value for each source zone, (ii) constant 𝑏-value for each source zone. For 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, the PGA values vary from 0.096 to 0.15 g and 0.09 to 0.26 g considering varying 𝑏-value, and constant 𝑏-value, respectively. In case of 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years, the PGA varies between 0.07 to 0.24 g considering varying 𝑏-values and 0.14 to 0.37 g considering constant 𝑏-values. Higher PGA values are observed in the southeast part considering varying 𝑏-values whereas the region situated around Kaurik Fault System (KFS) has shown higher PGA values in case of constant 𝑏-value.</p>

				<title>Associating an ionospheric parameter with major earthquake occurrence throughout the world</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With time, ionospheric variation analysis is gaining over lithospheric monitoring in serving precursors for earthquake forecast. The current paper highlights the association of major (Ms &#8805; 6.0) and medium (4.0 &#8804; Ms &gt; 6.0) earthquake occurrences throughout the world in different ranges of the Ionospheric Earthquake Parameter (IEP) where ‘Ms’ is earthquake magnitude on the Richter scale. From statistical and graphical analyses, it is concluded that the probability of earthquake occurrence is maximum when the defined parameter lies within the range of 0–75 (lower range). In the higher ranges, earthquake occurrence probability gradually decreases. A probable explanation is also suggested.</p>

				<title>Liquefaction-induced settlement, site effects and damage in the vicinity of Yalova City during the 1999 Izmit earthquake, Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0073-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Yalova City (Turkey) is in a tectonically active location that is particularly affected by the northern branch of the North Anatolian Fault Zone. Magnitudes 7.4 and 7.2 earthquakes in 1999 caused great destruction in Yalova. The heavy damage to buildings and other civil engineering structures was mainly due to liquefaction-induced settlement and site effects such as resonance and amplification. In the first phase of this study, the soil liquefaction potential index (<i>PL</i>) and the induced soil settlement were estimated. In the second phase, the effects on sites in Yalova soil were investigated using microtremor and earthquake data. The fundamental periods and amplification in soft soil were compared with microtremor data and strong ground motion records obtained by a local array of eight accelerograph stations deployed in Yalova. Thirty-seven ‘single site’ ambient noise measurements were taken in a dense grid of points covering the centre of the city. A comparison between fundamental periods obtained from strong ground motion records and from microtremor measurements showed similarities, in the 0.1–5 Hz range. Finally, soil liquefaction and amplification (or resonance) were divided into regions according to the extent of damage and the geotechnical/geophysical results.</p>

				<title>Water quality assessment and hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater on the aspect of metals in an old town, Foshan, south China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0091-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is aimed at assessing the water quality and discussing the hydrochemical characteristics and seasonal variation of shallow groundwater on the aspect of metals in the eastern Chancheng district of Foshan city, south China. Multivariate analytical methods such as principal components analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used in this study. The results show that 45% of groundwater in the east-central of study area is not suitable for drinking purpose due to high concentrations of Fe, Pb and Mn. The mean concentrations of Fe, Hg, Cu, Pb, and Mn in dry season are higher than that in wet season. On the contrary, the mean concentrations of Cd, Co, Zn, Ba, Cr, Mo, Ni and Al in wet season are higher than that in dry season. PCA results show that four PCs are responsible for the 78.6% of the total hydrochemical variables in groundwater. Three groups were generated from HCA method. Group 1 reflects the characteristic of wet season and the low ion exchange capacity; group 2 is mainly influenced by the dry season. Reducing environment and high ion exchange capacity are responsible for group 3. The results are useful in addressing future measures in groundwater resource management for local government.</p>

				<page>0101-0108</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper examines a possible effect of uncertainties, variability or heterogeneity of any dynamic system when being included in its evolution rule; the notion is illustrated with the advection dispersion equation, which describes the groundwater pollution model. An uncertain derivative is defined; some properties of the operator are presented. The operator is used to generalize the advection dispersion equation. The generalized equation differs from the standard equation in four properties. The generalized equation is solved via the variational iteration technique. Some illustrative figures are presented.</p>

				<title>Climatic control on extreme sediment transfer from Dokriani Glacier during monsoon, Garhwal Himalaya (India)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0109-0120</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Himalayas, most of the glaciers are covered by thick debris, especially in the ablation zone. Supraglacial debris cover might play an important role for sediment budget of the glaciated area or for the ablation of ice masses mantled in debris. During summer season, proglacial meltwater carries considerable amount of suspended sediment. The deglaciated area provides a ready source of sediment during Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The heavy sediment load from the glaciers affects the hydropower generation, irrigation and drinking water supply. Therefore, to understand the sediment delivery from glaciated basins, characteristics and variation of the suspended sediment concentrations in the proglacial meltwater stream, Dokriani Glacier, have been monitored during the ablation season (May– September). Suspended sediment samples were collected near the snout of Dokriani Glacier, Garhwal Himalaya, in 2010 and 2011. Results show that mean monthly suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were 1499, 2303, 3845 and 1649 mg/l for the months June, July, August, and September, respectively, indicating highest concentration in August followed by July. Over the period of recording, daily mean suspended concentration in the melt stream varied from 13–9798.2 mg/l, which is very high, caused due to a flash flood event during the monitoring period. The mean daily suspended sediment concentration was computed to be 2196 mg/l. The suspended sediment concentration begins to increase with discharge from May and reduces in September. Present study provides TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) derived and field based hydro-meteorological insight about severe rainstorms during the years 2010 and 2011 in the study area, which transported large amounts of sediment.</p>

				<title>Understanding the sediment routing system along the Gulf of Kachchh coast, western India: Significance of small ephemeral rivers</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0121-0133</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is an attempt towards understanding the sediment routing system in the semi-arid margin of the Gulf of Kachchh, which is one of the largest macrotidal regimes in the northern Arabian Sea. Investigations based on heavy minerals, clay minerals, mineral magnetic properties and sediment geochemistry indicated that there are three major sources of sediments contributing to the Gulf of Kachchh basin: (1) Indus River, (2) Kachchh mainland coastal rivers and (3) the Saurashtra peninsular coastal rivers. The flanks of northern and southern coast of western Gulf of Kachchh show dominant signatures of Kachchh mainland/Saurashtra peninsular provenance. In contrast, the eastern Gulf of Kachchh coast bearing fine grained sediments shows dominant Indus River Provenance. Although ephemeral in nature, the small coastal rivers of Saurashtra and Kachchh contribute significant amount of sediments to the Gulf of Kachchh coastline because of their ‘dryland’ nature and thus they control the coarse grained sedimentation processes.</p>

				<title>Seasonal impact on beach morphology and the status of heavy mineral deposition – central Tamil Nadu coast, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0135-0149</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of the present research was to investigate the seasonal impact on nearshore beach dynamics and the status of heavy mineral distribution along central Tamil Nadu coast, India. Beach profile measurements were made in 10 profiling sites between Thirukadaiyur and Velankanni on monthly and seasonal basis from January 2011 to July 2012. Using beach profile data, variation in beach width, slope and volumetric changes have been calculated. Beach slope and nearshore wave parameters were used to quantify the longshore sediment transport rate. Beaches between Thirukadaiyur and Karaikkal attained predominant transport rate in northern direction whereas, the rest of the beaches are in southern direction. The seasonal action of wind and wave currents create nearshore bar during northeast (NE) monsoon and frequent berms at tidal zone during southwest (SW) monsoon. Surface sediment samples were collected in each location for quantifying the heavy mineral weight percentage during the period of pre- and post-Thane cyclone. Sediments were also studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to evaluate the changes and occurrence of heavy minerals in beach sands. The XRD results show that sediments in the study area have enriched heavy mineral distribution even after strong cyclonic event. It confirms the redistribution of heavy mineral deposits present in the coast. The results suggested that monsoonal action has influenced the seasonal changes in beach morphology and it does not affect the heavy mineral distribution.</p>

				<title>Impact of modified soil thermal characteristic on the simulated monsoon climate over south Asia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0151-0160</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the influence of soil thermal characteristics (STC) on the simulated monsoon climate over south Asia is analyzed. The study was motivated by a common warm temperature bias over the plains of northern India that has been noticed in several global and regional climate models. To address this warm bias and its relation to STC, two sensitivity experiments have been performed with the regional climate model REMO of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The control experiment uses the standard soil thermal characteristic of the model that corresponds to a moist soil. The second experiment uses modified STC that characterize a dry soil, which is more representative of the considered region, as a large part of the region has arid, semi-arid or subtropical summer wet conditions. Both experiments were conducted over 20 years using re-analysis data as lateral boundary conditions. Results show that using the modified STC the predominant regional warm bias has reduced substantially, leading to a better and more realistic surface temperature compared to observations over south Asia. Although, the magnitude of bias has reduced, the warm bias still exists over the region suggesting that other atmospheric and land surface processes also play a role, such as aerosols and irrigation. These need to be addressed adequately in future modeling studies over the region.</p>

				<title>Wind and thermodynamic profiler observations of a late-mature gust front</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0161-0175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High temporal and vertical resolutions of kinematic and thermodynamic characteristics of a late-mature gust front are presented using the Mobile Integrated Profiling System andWeather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler data. As the gust front passed over the Mobile Integrated Profiling System vertical velocities and the horizontal wind field with 1 and 1.5 min temporal resolutions, respectively, were sampled within the gust front updrafts, gust frontal head and body structures. A 12-channel microwave profiling radiometer was used to delineate the thermodynamic properties with 5–6 min temporal and 100 m vertical resolution. Lidar backscatter from the 0.906 𝜇m ceilometer was also used to demonstrate the cloud field and the gust front depth. The gust front structurally and dynamically resembled laboratory simulated density current, and was composed of an elevated forward protrusion of a nose, and a turbulent mixing region at the top behind the head. The updrafts associated with the gust front that was moving into a stable layer were not surface rooted. Rather, the updrafts less than 3.5 $ms^{−1}$ were observed 500 m above ground level during the gust front passage. These updrafts were present from above the nose level to top of the head. The observations indicated that kinematic and thermodynamic characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer significantly influenced the propagation speed, updraft characteristics, and overall structural organization of the gust front. The observations validated that observed propagation speed of the gust front was in close agreement with the calculated propagation speed by integrating the buoyancy term within the gust front depth.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>An increase in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities is responsible for global warming and hence in recent years, CO<sub>2</sub> measurement network has expanded globally. In the monsoon season (July–September) of year 2011, we carried out measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O) concentrations along with wind and air temperature over a tropical site in southeast India having rural topography. To collect these observations, the instrumentations used were the sonic anemometer for wind and temperature, and the open path H<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub> infrared gas analyzer for CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O concentrations. Using these observations, we explored the diurnal variability of CO<sub>2</sub> flux along with sensible and latent heat. The CO<sub>2</sub> flux was positive during night-time and negative during daytime and in phase with convective instability. The CO<sub>2</sub> flux relationships with the meteorological parameters such as wind speed, temperature and heat fluxes have been analysed. The seasonal (monsoon) half hour mean of CO<sub>2</sub> flux which was −3.55 𝜇 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> indicated the experimental site as a CO<sub>2</sub> sink region (net seasonal uptake). An increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations during weekends was not observed due to unavailability of heavy vehicular traffic.</p>

				<title>Variations of aerosol optical depth and Angstrom parameters at a suburban location in Iran During 2009–2010</title>

				<page>0187-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solar irradiance is attenuated spectrally when passing through the earth’s atmosphere and it is strongly dependent on sky conditions, cleanliness of the atmosphere, composition of aerosols and gaseous constituents. In this paper, aerosol optical properties including aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (𝛼) and Angstrom turbidity coefficient (𝛽) have been investigated during December 2009 to October 2010, in a suburban area of Zanjan (36&#176;N, 43&#176;E, 1700 m), in the north–west of Iran, using meteorological and sun photometric data. Results show that turbidity varies on all time scales, from the seasonal to hourly, because of changes in the atmospheric meteorological parameters. The values of 𝛼 range from near zero to 1.67. The diurnal variation of AOD in Zanjan is about 15%. The diurnal variability of AOD, showed a similar variation pattern in spring (including March, April, May) and winter (December, January, February) and had a different variation pattern in summer (June, July, August) and autumn (September and October). During February, spring and early summer winds transport continental aerosols mostly from the Iraq (dust events) and cause the increase of beta and turbidity of atmosphere of Zanjan.</p>

				<title>Physical properties of the arctic summer aerosol particles in relation to sources at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0201-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Measurements of the number concentration and size distribution of aerosol particles in the size range of 0.5–20 𝜇m diameter were made with an aerodynamic particle sizer at an Arctic site at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard in August–September 2007 during the International Polar Year 2007–2008. Data are analyzed to study the aerosol number concentration–wind speed relationships. The sea-salt particles of marine origin generated within the Arctic circle are identified as the main source of the Arctic summer aerosols. Total number concentration of aerosol particles increases with increase in wind speed, the increase being more when winds from open leads over the oceanic sector are reaching the station as compared to when winds from pack ice in other directions are reaching the station. The larger increase with winds from the oceanic sector is attributed to the enhanced bubble-breaking activity and increased entrainment of dimethyl sulphide particles at the sea surface. Although, the increase in total aerosol number concentration associated with the winds from the oceanic sector is spread over the whole range of particle sizes, the increase in coarse mode particles is more prominent than that in the accumulation mode particles. The age of airmass over pack ice is also an important factor to determine the aerosol concentration over the Arctic region. The process of rainout/washout of the aerosol particles due to drizzle/snowfall is an effective sink mechanism in the Arctic environment. The aerosol particle concentration starts decreasing within a few minutes from the start of these events but requires a few hours to restore to the normal background aerosol level after the end of event.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The main objective of this study is to assess the health hazards due to radon gas accumulation and to compare the concentrations in different kinds of workplaces, in the city of Adapazarı, one of the most important industrial cities of Turkey. For this purpose, radon activity concentration measurements were carried out in schools, factories, offices and outdoors using CR-39 solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD). Results show that the mean radon activity concentrations (RAC) in schools, offices and factories were found to be 66, 76 and 27 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, with an outdoor concentration of 14 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>. The average concentrations were found to decrease as follows for different types of industries: automotive &lt; electronic &lt; metal &lt; textile. Because the maximum measured radon concentrations are 151 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> in the schools, 173 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> in the offices and 52 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> in the factories, the limits of ICRP are not exceeded in any of the buildings in the region. In addition, the estimated mean annual effective doses to the people in the workplace, students, office workers and factory workers have been calculated as 0.27, 0.63 and 0.20 mSv/y, respectively for the region.</p>

				<title>Palynology and clay mineralogy of the Deccan volcanic associated sediments of Saurashtra, Gujarat: Age and paleoenvironments</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0219-0232</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The intertrappean sediments associated with Deccan Continental Flood Basalt (DCFB) sequence at Ninama in Saurashtra, Gujarat yielded palynoassemblage comprising at least 12 genera and 14 species including Paleocene taxa such as <i>Intrareticulites brevis, Neocouperipollis</i> spp., <i>Striacolporites striatus, Retitricolpites crassimarginatus</i> and <i>Rhombipollis</i> sp. The lava flows of Saurashtra represent the northwestern most DCFB sequence in India. It is considered that the Saurashtra lava flows represent the earliest volcanic activity in the Late Cretaceous of the Reunion Mantle Plume on the northward migrating Indian Plate. The present finding of the Paleocene palynoflora from Ninama sediments indicate Paleocene age for the associated lava flows occurring above the intertrappean bed which suggests that the Saurashtra plateau witnessed eruption of Deccan lava flows even during Paleocene. The clay mineral investigation of the Ninama sediments which are carbonate dominated shows dominance of low charge smectite (LCS) along with the presence of mica and vermiculite. Based on the clay mineral assemblage it is interpreted that arid climatic conditions prevailed during the sedimentation. The smectite dominance recorded within these sediments is in agreement with global record of smectite peak close to the Maastrichtian-Paleocene transition and climatic aridity.</p>

				<title>Compositional diversity of near-, far-side transitory zone around Naonobu, Webb and Sinus Successus craters: Inferences from Chandrayaan-1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<sup>3</sup>) data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0233-0246</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigated the potential of Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M<sup>3</sup>) data for studying compositional variation in the near-, far-side transition zone of the lunar surface. For this purpose, the radiance values of the M<sup>3</sup> data were corrected for illumination and emission related effects and converted to apparent reflectance. Dimensionality of the calibrated reflectance image cube was reduced using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and endmembers were extracted by using Pixel Purity Index (PPI) algorithm. The selected endmembers were linearly unmixed and resolved for mineralogy using United States Geological Survey (USGS) library spectra of minerals. These mineralogically resolved endmembers were used to map the compositional variability within, and outside craters using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm. Cross validation for certain litho types was attempted using band ratios like Optical Maturity (OMAT), Color Ratio Composite and Integrated Band Depth ratio (IBD). The identified lithologies for highland and basin areas match well with published works and strongly support depth related magmatic differentiation. Prevalence of pigeonite-basalt, pigeonite-norite and pyroxenite in crater peaks and floors are unique to the investigated area and are attributed to local, lateral compositional variability in magma composition due to pressure, temperature, and rate of cooling.</p>

				<title>Improvements in medium range weather forecasting system of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0247-0258</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Medium range weather forecasts are being generated in real time using Global Data Assimilation Forecasting System (GDAFS) at NCMRWF since 1994. The system has been continuously upgraded in terms of data usage, assimilation and forecasting system. Recently this system was upgraded to a horizontal resolution of T574 (about 22 km) with 64 levels in vertical. The assimilation scheme of this upgraded system is based on the latest Grid Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme and it has the provision to use most of available meteorological and oceanographic satellite datasets besides conventional meteorological observations. The new system has an improved procedure for relocating tropical cyclone to its observed position with the correct intensity. All these modifications have resulted in improvement of skill of medium range forecasts by about 1 day.</p>

				<title>Impact of cloud microphysics and cumulus parameterization on simulation of heavy rainfall event during 7–9 October 2007 over Bangladesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0259-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) version 3.2.1 has been used to simulate the heavy rainfall event that occurred between 7 and 9 October 2007 in the southern part of Bangladesh. Weather Research and Forecast (WRF–ARW version) modelling system with six different microphysics (MP) schemes and two different cumulus parameterization (CP) schemes in a nested configuration was chosen for simulating the event. The model domains consist of outer and inner domains having 9 and 3 km horizontal resolution, respectively with 28 vertical sigma levels. The impacts of cloud microphysical processes by means of precipitation, wind and reflectivity, kinematic and thermodynamic characteristics of the event have been studied. Sensitivity experiments have been conducted with the WRF model to test the impact of microphysical and cumulus parameterization schemes in capturing the extreme weather event. NCEP FNL data were used for the initial and boundary condition. The model ran for 72 h using initial data at 0000 UTC of 7 October 2007. The simulated rainfall shows that WSM6–KF combination gives better results for all combinations and after that Lin–KF combination. WSM3–KF has simulated, less area average rainfall out of all MP schemes that were coupled with KF scheme. The sharp peak of relative humidity up to 300 hPa has been simulated along the vertical line where maximum updraft has been found for all MPs coupled with KF and BMJ schemes. The simulated rain water and cloud water mixing ratio were maximum at the position where the vertical velocity and reflectivity has also been maximum. The production of rain water mixing ratio depends on MP schemes as well as CP schemes. Rainfall depends on rain water mixing ratio between 950 and 500 hPa. Rain water mixing ratio above 500 hPa level has no effect on surface rain.</p>

				<title>Trend analysis and change point detection of annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature series over southwest Iran</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0281-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents results of trend analysis and change point detection of annual and seasonal precipitation, and mean temperature (TM), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN) time series of the period 1950–2007. Investigations were carried out for 50 precipitation stations and 39 temperature stations located in southwest Iran. Three statistical tests including Pettitt’s test, Sequential Mann–Kendall test (SQ-MK test) and Mann–Kendall rank test (MK-test) were used for the analysis. The results obtained for precipitation series indicated that most stations showed insignificant trends in annual and seasonal series. Out of the stations which showed significant trends, highest numbers were observed during winter season while no significant trends were detected in summer precipitation. Moreover, no decreasing significant trends were detected by statistical tests in annual and seasonal precipitation series. The analysis of temperature trends revealed a significant increase during summer and spring seasons. TMAX was more stable than TMIN and TM, and winter was stable compared to summer, spring and autumn seasons. The results of change point detection indicated that most of the positive significant mutation points in TM, TMAX and TMIN began in the 1990s.</p>

				<title>Condensation of water vapour on moss-dominated biological soil crust, NW China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0297-0305</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Characteristics of water vapour condensation, including the onset, duration, and amount of water vapour condensation on moss-dominated biological soil crust (BSC) and dune sand were studied under simulated conditions with varying air temperature and relative humidity. The simulations were performed in a plant growth chamber using an electronic balance recording the weight of condensation. There was a positive linear correlation between the water vapour condensation and relative humidity while the mean temperature was negatively linearly related to amounts of water vapour condensation for both soil surfaces. The amount of water vapour condensation on BSC and dune sand can be described by the difference between air temperature and dew point with an exponential function, indicating that when the difference of air temperature and dew point exceeds a value of 35.3&#176;C, there will be zero water vapour condensed on BSC. In contrast, when the difference of air temperature and dew point exceeds a value of 20.4&#176;C, the water vapour condensation will be zero for dune sand. In general, when  the air is fully saturated with water and the dew point is equal to the current air temperature, the water vapour condensed on BSC attained its maximum value of 0.398 mm, whereas it was 0.058 mm for dune sand. In comparison, water vapour condensed on BSC was at a relatively high temperature and low relative humidity, while we did not detect water vapour condensation on the dune sand under the similar conditions. Physical and chemical analyses of the samples pointed to a greater porosity, high content of fine particles, and high salinity for BSC compared to the dune sand. These results highlight that soil physicochemical properties are the likely factors influencing the mechanism of water vapour condensation under specific meteorological conditions, as onset was earlier and the duration was longer for water vapour condensation on BSC in comparison with that of dune sand. This contributed to the greater amount of vapour absorbed on BSC compared to the dune sand under an identical meteorological condition. The feedback of water vapour condensation on BSC formation and its contribution to sustain the revegetation desert ecosystems was discussed.</p>

				<title>Predictive accuracy of backpropagation neural network methodology in evapotranspiration forecasting in Dédougou region, western Burkina Faso</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0307-0318</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study evaluates the predictive accuracy of the feed forward backpropagation artificial neural network (BP) in evapotranspiration forecasting from temperature data basis in Dédougou region located in western Burkina Faso, sub-Saharan Africa. BP accuracy is compared to the conventional Blaney–Criddle (BCR) and Reference Model developed for Burkina Faso (RMBF) by referring to the FAO56 Penman–Monteith (PM) as the standard method. Statistically, the models accuracies were evaluated with the goodness-of-fit measures of root mean square error, mean absolute error and coefficient of determination between their estimated and PM observed values. From the statistical results, BP shows similar contour trends to PM, and performs better than the conventional methods in reference evapotranspiration (ET_ref) forecasting in the region. In poor data situation, BP based only on temperature data is much more preferred than the other alternative methods for ET_ref forecasting. Furthermore, it is noted that the BP network computing technique accuracy improves significantly with the addition of wind velocity into the network input set. Therefore, in the region, wind velocity is recommended to be incorporated into the BP model for high accuracy management purpose of irrigation water, which relies on accurate values of ET_ref.</p>

				<title>Dynamic monitoring of landscape patterns and ecological processes using HJ-1 and SPOT satellite data over Hulunbeier grassland, China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0319-0328</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Landscape patterns and ecological processes have been in long-term research focus in the field of landscape ecology, but how to measure their quantitative relations is still open. This work chooses the Hulunbeier grassland as the study area where ecosystem shows high vulnerability, frequent evolvement of landscape patterns and ecological processes. With remote sensing technology, the relationships between landscape patterns and ecological processes were analyzed quantitatively from multi-scale, multitemporal and time series perspective. Firstly, the information about the current situation and change of landscape patterns and ecological processes are obtained from HJ-1 (Environmental and Disaster Small Satellite) and LANDSAT TM (Thermal Mapper) data. Secondly, SPOT NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data during 2000–2008 are used to analyze the dynamic changes of ecological processes, and to simulate its inter-annual variety at pixel scale. Finally, the dynamic change trends of ecological processes of grassland vegetation are described. The results indicate that the unchanged ecosystem types account for most of the study area, unused land in the central part expands continuously which results in the increase of desertification, and most ecosystem types in the eastern part are changed to grassland and woodland. Furthermore, the vegetation vulnerability is the highest in the grassland-dominated region, the second in grassland–farmland–woodland transition, and the smallest in the woodland-dominated region, where the stability is enhanced in turn. Due to the dynamic change of vegetation, it can be concluded that the study area underwent ecological processes of vegetation cover with a negative trend and a changed phenology.</p>

				<title>Shallow geological environment of Krishna–Godavari offshore, eastern continental margin of India as inferred from the interpretation of high resolution sparker data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0329-0342</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Krishna–Godavari offshore basin, a part of the eastern continental margin of India is a proven petroliferous basin. Recent drilling in this area in search of gas hydrates reveals that the upper ∼300 m thick Quaternary–Recent strata comprised of nannofossil bearing rich clays and, fractures/faults are the suitable zones for gas hydrates accumulation. Therefore, the knowledge about the shallow geological environments and its architecture are significantly important in assessing the gas hydrates potential of this area. In order to enhance the geological understanding, the newly acquired high resolution seismic (HRS) reflection data in this gas hydrates prone area is interpreted. The processed seismic sections show a maximum penetration of 562 ms TWT (∼450 m) underneath the seabed with high resolution stratification. An attempt has been made to: (i) deduce the shallow geological environment from the reflection characteristics, and, (ii) assign tentative ages under the constraints of drilling/coring results. We further explained the observed folded structures on the surface and subsurface through a mechanism linked to shale tectonism and neotectonic activity.</p>

				<title>Neotectonic activity and parity in movements of Udaipur block of the Arvalli Craton and Indian Plate</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0343-0350</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report site motion of a permanent GPS site at Udaipur (udai), Rajasthan on the Udaipur block of Aravalli Craton. The GPS measurements of 2007–2011 suggest that the site moves at a rate of about 49 mm/year towards northeast. As the site motion is consistent with the predicted plate motion using the estimated euler pole of rotation for the Indian Plate, it implies that there is insignificant internal deformation/strain in the region. Such a deformation is consistent with very low seismic activity in the region. The epicenters of the infrequent low magnitude earthquakes are located on the Precambrian lineaments on the west of Udaipur Block, and on the NW–SE striking younger lineament in the south of the block.</p>

				<title>Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) studies of Campanian–Maastrichtian sediments of Ariyalur Group, Cauvery Basin, Tamil Nadu, India: An appraisal to Paleocurrent directions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0351-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oriented samples of sediments from Ariyalur Group, Cauvery Basin, south India, were studied for low field anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements to unravel the magnetic fabrics and paleocurrent directions. The results of AMS parameters of the sediments indicate primary depositional fabrics for Sillakkudi, Ottakovil and Kallamedu sandstone formations and secondary fabric for Kallankurichchi limestone formation. The obtained low degree of anisotropy ($P_j$), oblate shape AMS ellipsoid and distribution of maximum ($K_1$) and minimum ($K_3$) susceptibility axes on equal area projection confirm the primary sedimentary fabric for Sillakkudi, Ottakovil and Kallamedu Formations. In the case of ferruginous, lower arenaceous, Gryphaea limestone and upper arenaceous limestone beds of Kallankurichchi Formation have recorded more than one fabric. The observed AMS parameters like shape factor (𝑇) (prolate to oblate), 𝑞 value and random distribution of minimum ($K_3$) and maximum ($K_1$) susceptibility axes are supported for secondary fabrics in Kallankurichchi Formation as a result of post-depositional processes. Based on petrographic studies, it can be established that $K_1$ AMS axis of biotite mineral could represent the flow direction. The established paleocurrent direction for Sillakkudi is NW–SE direction while Ottakovil and Kallamedu Formations recorded NE–SW direction. Overall the paleoflow directions observed for Ariyalur Group is NE–SW to NW–SE.</p>

				<title>Numerical evaluation of seismic response of shallow foundation on loose silt and silty sand</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0365-0379</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study includes the results of a set of numerical simulations carried out for sands containing plastic/non-plastic fines, and silts with relative densities of approximately 30−40% under different surchargeson the shallow foundation using FLAC 2D. Each model was subjected to three ground motion events, obtained by scaling the amplitude of the El Centro (1940), Kobe (1995) and Kocaeli (1999) earthquakes. Dynamic behaviour of loose deposits underlying shallow foundations is evaluated through fully coupled nonlinear effective stress dynamic analyses. Effects of nonlinear soil structure interaction (SSI) were also considered by using interface elements. This parametric study evaluates the effects of soil type, structure weight, liquefiable soil layer thickness, event parameters (e.g., moment magnitude of earthquake (\tetit {M_w}), peak ground acceleration PGA, PGV/PGA ratio and the duration of strong motion (\tetit {D}_{5−95})and their interactions on the seismic responses. Investigation on the effects of these parameters and their complex interactions can be a valuable tool to gain new insights for improved seismic design and construction.</p>

				<title>City of Bingöl in May 2003: Assessment of strong ground motion records</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0381-0394</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main shock of Bingöl earthquake ($M_W$ = 6.4) recorded by six accelerometers in the area occurred at 03:27 local time on May 1, 2003. The largest acceleration value of north–south component was recorded as 545.5 cm/$s^2$ at the nearest station which is 12 km away from the epicenter of earthquake. Especially, 0.15 s short period was observed when high spectral acceleration value occurred. An acceleration value greater than 50 gal was recorded at the BNG (Bingöl) station and structural damage occurred within 6.5 s was very important for the near source and strong ground motion seismology. The recorded peak acceleration values were greater than the estimated empirical acceleration values. However, the structural damage was not as high and widespread as expected. This occurrence was explained by considering the factors of earthquake source, frequency content, effective duration, effective acceleration value, local soil conditions, rupture direction and attenuation.</p>

				<title>A novel and generalized approach in the inversion of geoelectrical resistivity data using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0395-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The non-linear apparent resistivity problem in the subsurface study of the earth takes into account the model parameters in terms of resistivity and thickness of individual subsurface layers using the trained synthetic data by means of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Here we used a single layer feed-forward neural network with fast back propagation learning algorithm. So on proper training of back propagation networks it tends to give the resistivity and thickness of the subsurface layer model of the field resistivity data with reference to the synthetic data trained in the appropriate network. During training, the weights and biases of the network are iteratively adjusted to make network performance function level more efficient. On adequate training, errors are minimized and the best result is obtained using the artificial neural networks. The network is trained with more number of VES data and this trained network is demonstrated by the field data. The accuracy of inversion depends upon the number of data trained. In this novel and specially designed algorithm, the interpretation of the vertical electrical sounding has been done successfully with the more accurate layer model.</p>

				<title>First perissodactyl footprints from Flysch deposits of the Barail Group (Lower Oligocene) of Manipur, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0413-0420</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two pes imprints of a perissodactyl mammal constituting a single step of a trackway have recently been discovered in Oligocene Flysch deposits of the Barail Group in Manipur, India. The tridactyl, mesaxonic imprints (∼7 cm in length) show strong similarities to footprints known from the Paleogene of China and can be attributed to a tapiroid, rhinocerotoid or equoid trackmaker. This is the first record of perissodactyl footprints from the Lower Oligocene of India and the first evidence of mammals in the Barail Group of the age. Remarkable is the occurrence in a marginal marine setting, whereas other known perissodactyl footprints from the Eocene–Oligocene in particular from North America, Europe and China come from fluvio-lacustrine strata.</p>

				<title>Ichnofauna from the Harbans Bed of the Badhaura Formation (Sterlitmakian), Rajasthan, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0421-0432</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the first ever systematic study of trace fossils from the Badhaura Formation, the authors described a nesting burrow, which they ascribed to a stomatopod. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: primarily, to document ichnofauna from (post-glacial marine late Palaeozoic rocks of peninsular India) the Badhaura Formation (Sterlitmakian) representing marine rocks deposited following the Late Palaeozoic glaciation and secondly to contribute to the data on post-glacial ichnofauna from constituent continents of the Gondwanaland. Trace fossils described here are from the Harbans Bed, the topmost lithounit of the Badhaura Formation. The ichnofauna includes <i>Arenicolites tenuis, Beaconites</i> isp., <i>Curvolithus</i> isp., <i>Cylindrichnus concentricus, Didymaulichnus lyelli, Ophiomorpha</i> isp., <i>Palaeophycus tubularis, Planolites beverleyensis, P. montanus, Rosselia chonoides, R. socialis, Skolithos linearis, Taenidium cameronensis, Thalassinoides paradoxicus, Thalassinoides</i> isp. and a flask-shaped brood chamber assigned to a stomatopod crustacean. This mixed assemblage is assigned to distal <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies and is suggestive of a period of relatively quiet, shallow water conditions of deposition. The ichnofauna, when viewed in context of peri-gondwanic ichnofaunas, mainly consisting of simple tracks and trails, from late Palaeozoic post-glacial deposits of other Gondwanan continents, is interesting due to dominance of domichnia. Profusion of brood chambers along with <i>Thalassinoides</i> in the Badhaura Formation validates the concept of pre-Mesozoic <i>Thalassinoides</i> being non-decapod in origin and suggestive of adaptive convergence.</p>

				<title>Study of equatorial regions of Moon with the help of backscattering coefficient obtained from LRO data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0433-0443</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has a miniature radio-frequency (Mini-RF) payload, i.e., the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) that has provided very fundamental information about the lunar surface and subsurface which was not known inspite of many manned and unmanned missions. Microwave sensors are used for analyzing the equatorial region of the Moon (60&#176;N to 60&#176;S) which is covered with many well-known craters like Kopff, Taylor, Maunder, Descartes, Jackson and Santos Dumont, each having different topography. The LRO data in terms of the scattering coefficient (𝜎&#176;<sub>LH</sub> and 𝜎&#176;<sub>LV</sub>) with incidence angle of 49&#176; has been used for computing physical and electrical parameter of lunar surface and to learn more about the impact cratering process. Most of the lunar surface shows small Circular Polarization Ratio (CPR), i.e., the reversal of polarization is normal, but some targets have high CPR. In this paper we have discussed the scattering behaviour of lunar equatorial region where the value of CPR &lt; 1. Studies say that the LV intensity is always greater than LH but from the data obtained from LRO, it is observed that it varies at each pixel depending upon the target properties under radar view.</p>

				<title>Has influence of extratropical waves in modulating Indian summer  monsoon rainfall (ISMR) increased?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0445-0456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the paper, influence of extratropical circulation features on Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is examined. Energetics of extra tropics, north of Indian subcontinent for deficient and nondeficient ISMR years, during two periods 1951–1978 and 1979–2005, are calculated and critically analyzed. It is observed that for the period 1951–1978, only two out of the 10 energetic parameters, viz., the zonal available potential energy (high) and conversion of zonal available potential with kinetic energy to eddy kinetic energy (low) differed significantly in JJA months of the deficient years from that of the nondeficient years. However, during the 1979–2005 period, as many as six out of the 10 energetic parameters, viz., eddy available potential energy, zonal available potential energy, eddy kinetic energy, generation of zonal available potential energy, conversion of zonal available potential energy to zonal kinetic energy and conversion of zonal kinetic energy to eddy kinetic energy differed significantly in JJA months of the deficient years from that of the nondeficient years. These results confirm growing influence of the transient stationary waves in deficient years after the climate shift year, 1979. Analysis of energetic parameters of the pre-monsoon season of the two periods also reveals similar results. This suggests that forcings apparently responsible for energetics in JJA months of the deficient years of the later period were present even before the advent of Indian summer monsoon season.</p>

				<title>Use of artificial neural network for spatial rainfall analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0457-0465</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, the precipitation data measured at 23 rain gauge stations over the Achaia County, Greece, were used to estimate the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation values over a specific catchment area. The objective of this work was achieved by programming an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that uses the feed-forward back-propagation algorithm as an alternative interpolating technique. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was utilized to process the data derived by the ANN and to create a continuous surface that represented the spatial mean annual precipitation distribution.The ANN introduced an optimization procedure that was implemented during training, adjusting the hidden number of neurons and the convergence of the ANN in order to select the best network architecture. The performance of the ANN was evaluated using three standard statistical evaluation criteria applied to the study area and showed good performance. The outcomes were also compared with the results obtained from a previous study in the area of research which used a linear regression analysis for the estimation of the mean annual precipitation values giving more accurate results. The information and knowledge gained from the present study could improve the accuracy of analysis concerning hydrology and hydrogeological models, ground water studies, flood related applications and climate analysis studies.</p>

				<page>0467-0478</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is an urgent need to identify the human influence on landscape as disturbance regimes was realized for prioritization of the protected areas. The present study has attempted to describe the landscape level assessment of fragmentation and disturbance index in protected areas of Rajasthan using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Geospatial analysis of disturbance regimes indicates 61.75% of the total Pas are under moderate disturbance index followed by 28.64% and 9.61% under low and high, respectively. Among the 28 protected areas – National Chambal WLS, Jaisamand WLS, Kumbhalgarh WLS, Sawai Man Singh WLS, Kailadevi WLS and Bandh BarathaWLS are representing high level of disturbance. The present study has emphasized the moderate to low disturbance regimes in protected areas, which infer low biotic pressure and conservation effectiveness of PA network in Rajasthan. The spatial information generated on PAs is of valuable use for forest management and developing conservation strategies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of the present study was to ascertain contamination levels, distribution behaviour and PAHs exposure during summer, winter and autumn during 2011–2012 in one of the developing cities of northern India. Average PAHs concentration was found to be 18.17, 4.04 and 16.38 𝜇 g g<sup>−1</sup>, whereas, concentration of 16 individual PAHs was found to vary between 0.02 and 200.23, 0.008 and 28.4 𝜇g g<sup>−1</sup>, and 0.01 and 252.55 𝜇g g<sup>−1</sup> during summer, winter and autumn seasons, respectively. The average concentration of low and high carcinogenic PAHs during summer, winter and autumn was found to be 5.1 and 31.29, 2.1 and 6.4, 4.74 and 35.08 𝜇g g<sup>−1</sup> at most intercepts. The average ratio of low to high carcinogenic PAHs was found to be 1:6, 1:3, 1:7.6 during summer, winter and autumn, respectively. Five ringed PAHs were found in higher concentration in all seasons. Dib(ah)A and B(a)P were the two individual PAHs found in highest concentration during summer, winter and autumn seasons. Two tailed T-test was applied for authenticity of the results. Toxic equivalency factor of B(a)P and Dib(ah)A was maximum as compared to other PAHs. The study could be of great significance for the planners while considering environmental remedial measures.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of soil corrosivity and aquifer protective capacity using geoelectrical investigation in Bwari basement complex area, Abuja</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0491-0502</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bwari is one of the six municipal area councils of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja with its attendant growing population and infrastructural developments. Groundwater is the main source of water supply in the area, and urbanization and industrialization are the predominant contributors of contaminants to the hydrological systems. In order to guarantee a continuous supply of potable water, there is a need to investigate the vulnerability of the aquifers to contaminants emanating from domestic and industrial wastes. A total of 20 vertical electrical soundings using Schlumberger electrode array with a maximum half current electrodes separation of 300 m was employed. The results show that the area is characterized by 3–6 geoelectric subsurface layers. The measured overburden thickness ranges from 1.0 to 24.3 m, with a mean value of 7.4 m. The resistivity and longitudinal conductance of the overburden units range from 18 to 11,908 𝛺 m and 0.047 to 0.875 mhos, respectively. Areas considered as high corrosivity are the central parts with 𝜌 &gt; 180 𝛺 m. The characteristic longitudinal unit conductance was used to classify the area into zones of good (0.7–4.49 mhos), moderate (0.2–0.69 mhos), weak (0.1–0.19 mhos), and poor (&gt; 0.1) aquifer protective capacity. Zones characterized by materials of moderate to good protective capacity serve as sealing potential for the underlying hydrogeological system in the area. This study is aimed at delineating zones that are very prone to groundwater contamination from surface contaminants and subsurface soils that are corrosive to utility pipes buried underground. Hence the findings of this work will constitute part of the tools for groundwater development and management and structural/infrastructural development planning of the area.</p>

				<title>GIS and SBF for estimating groundwater recharge of a mountainous  basin in the Wu River watershed, Taiwan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0503-0516</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The temporal and spatial distributions of precipitation are extremely uneven; so, careful management of water resources in Taiwan is crucial. The long-term overexploitation of groundwater resources poses a challenge to water resource management in Taiwan. However, assessing groundwater resources in mountainous basins is challenging due to limited information. In this study, a geographic information system (GIS) and stable base-flow (SBF) techniques were used to assess the characteristics of groundwater recharge considering the Wu River watershed in central Taiwan as a study area. First, a GIS approach was used to integrate five contributing factors: lithology, land cover/land use, lineaments, drainage, and slope. The weights of factors contributing to the groundwater recharge were obtained from aerial photos, geological maps, a land use database, and field verification. Second, the SBF was used to estimate the groundwater recharge in a mountainous basin scale. The concept of the SBF technique was to separate the base-flow from the total streamflow discharge in order to obtain a measure of groundwater recharge. The SBF technique has the advantage of integrating groundwater recharge across an entire basin without complex hydro-geologic modelling and detailed knowledge of the soil characteristics. In this study, our approach for estimating recharge provides not only an estimate of how much water becomes groundwater, but also explains the characteristics of a potential groundwater recharge zone.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of regional fracture properties for groundwater development using hydrolithostructural domain approach in variably fractured  hard rocks of Purulia district, West Bengal, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0517-0529</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estimation of geohydrologic properties of fractured aquifers in hard crystalline and/or metamorphosed country rocks is a challenge due to the complex nature of secondary porosity that is caused by differential fracturing. Hydrologic potentiality of such aquifers may be assessed if the geological controls governing the spatial distribution of these fracture systems are computed using a software-based model. As an exemplar, the Precambrian metamorphics exposed in and around the Balarampur town of Purulia district, West Bengal (India) were studied to find out the spatial pattern and consistency of such fracture systems. Surfer and Statistica softwares were used to characterize these rock masses in terms of hydrological, structural and lithological domains. The technique is based on the use of hydraulically significant fracture properties to generate representative modal and coefficient of variance ($C_ν$) of fracture datasets of each domain. The $C_ν$ is interpreted to obtain the spatial variability of hydraulically significant fracture properties that, in turn, define and identify the corresponding hydrolithostructural domains. The groundwater flow estimated from such a technique is verified with the routine hydrological studies to validate the procedure. It is suggested that the hydrolithostructural domain approach is a useful alternative for evaluation of fracture properties and aquifer potentiality, and development of a regional groundwater model thereof.</p>

				<title>Hydrogeological and geophysical study for deeper groundwater resource in quartzitic hard rock ridge region from 2D resistivity data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0531-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Electrical resistivity method is a versatile and economical technique for groundwater prospecting in different geological settings due to wide spectrum of resistivity compared to other geophysical parameters. Exploration and exploitation of groundwater, a vital and precious resource, is a challenging task in hard rock, which exhibits inherent heterogeneity. In the present study, two-dimensional Electrical Resistivity Tomography (2D-ERT) technique using two different arrays, viz., pole–dipole and pole–pole, were deployed to look into high signal strength data in a tectonically disturbed hard rock ridge region for groundwater. Four selected sites were investigated. 2D subsurface resistivity tomography data were collected using <i>Syscal Pro Switch-10</i> channel system and covered a 2 km long profile in a tough terrain. The hydrogeological interpretation based on resistivity models reveal the water horizons trap within the clayey sand and weathered/fractured quartzite formations. Aquifer resistivity lies between ∼3–35 and 100–200 𝛺 m. The results of the resistivity models decipher potential aquifer lying between 40 and 88 m depth, nevertheless, it corroborates with the static water level measurements in the area of study. The advantage of using pole–pole in conjunction with the pole–dipole array is well appreciated and proved worth which gives clear insight of the aquifer extent, variability and their dimension from shallow to deeper strata from the hydrogeological perspective in the present geological context.</p>

				<title>Investigation of the relationship between ground and engineering bedrock at northern part of the Gulf of İzmir  by borehole data supported geophysical works</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0545-0564</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Loss of life and property that may occur as a result of a possible earthquake can be reduced by earthquake resistant building designs. In order to investigate possible ground motion amplification in earthquake resistant building design, relationship between the ground and engineering bedrock must be ensured. In order to provide this relation, structure, basic characteristics, and thickness of the ground are investigated. In this context, calculating ground transfer function, obtaining horizontal earthquake acceleration changes, calculating $V_s$ values and defining the engineering bedrock are necessary. In this study, Menemen plain, the nothern part of Izmir metropolitan located in active earthquake zone and its immediate vicinity have been examined to define the structure, ground, engineering and bedrock relation. In this context, Menemen plain has been investigated by geophysical methods, which are supported with borehole data (microtremor, MASW – multichannel analysis of surface waves, microgravity measurements, and vertical electrical sounding – VES). Microtremor method was conducted at 377 points in average in the investigation area to define fundamental period and empirical transfer function; after that in order to create basin model and to define the shallow subsurface geometry, microgravity measurements were carried out by using Scintrex CG-5. Also, MASW measurements were carried out in approximately 277 profiles and Schlumberger VES measurements were conducted at approximately 7 points in the investigation area. The existence of a linear relation between H/V peak period values obtained by microtremor measurements and ground thickness in the investigation area is also supported by geothermal drilling logs (depth of 600 m) with microgravity survey. Also, in some parts of the investigation area, it was observed that high 𝑆 velocity $(V_s)$ values affected H/V peak period values in sections of the ground close to the surface and there was an inversely correlated relation between this ground thickness and peak period values. This event occurring in shallow depths is supported by both VES sections and 2nd order vertical gravity derivative. As a result, depth of the engineering bedrock was obtained between 200 and 700 m and this unit was proposed as Bornova Melange for the investigation area in the scope of the works carried out. Also, it is observed that the area from ground to the engineering bedrock consists of four different layers which were defined by individual 𝑆 velocities and densities. According to all results, characterictics of the shallow subsurface show that there is a high heterogeneity. Therefore, according to Eurocode8 (EC8 2004) regulations, soil characteristic of the Menemen plain and its vicinity are in the S1–S2 soil class.</p>

				<title>Seismic hazard analysis of Sinop province, Turkey using probabilistic and statistical methods</title>

				<page>0565-0579</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using 4.0 and greater magnitude earthquakes which occurred between 1 January 1900 and 31 December 2008 in the Sinop province of Turkey this study presents a seismic hazard analysis based on the probabilistic and statistical methods. According to the earthquake zonation map, Sinop is divided into first, second, third and fourth-degree earthquake regions. Our study area covered the coordinates between 40.66&#176;–42.82&#176;N and 32.20&#176;–36.55&#176;E. The different magnitudes of the earthquakes during the last 108 years recorded on varied scales were converted to a common scale (Mw). The earthquake catalog was then recompiled to evaluate the potential seismic sources in the aforesaid province. Using the attenuation relationships given by Boore <i>et al</i>. (1997) and Kalkan and Gülkan (2004), the largest ground accelerations corresponding to a recurrence period of 475 years are found to be 0.14 g for bedrock at the central district. Comparing the seismic hazard curves, we show the spatial variations of seismic hazard potential in this province, enumerating the recurrence period in the order of 475 years.</p>

				<title>Ice thickness, volume and subglacial topography of Urumqi Glacier No. 1, Tianshan mountains, central Asia, by ground penetrating radar survey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0581-0591</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The results of radar survey for three times are presented, aiming to determine ice thickness, volume and subglacial topography of Urumqi Glacier No. 1, Tianshan Mountains, central Asia. Results show that the distribution of ice is more in the center and lesser at both ends of the glacier. The bedrock is  quite regular with altitudes decreasing towards the ice front, showing the U-shaped subglacial valley. By comparison, typical ice thinning along the centerline of the East Branch of the glacier was 10–18 m for the period 1981–2006, reaching a maximum of ∼30 m at the terminus. The corresponding ice volume was 10296.2 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>, 8797.9 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>3</sup> and 8115.0 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>3</sup> in 1981, 2001 and 2006, respectively. It has decreased by 21.2% during the past 25 years, which is the direct result of glacier thinning. In the same period, the ice thickness, area and terminus decreased by 12.2%, 10.3%, and 3.6%, respectively. These changes are responses to the regional climatic warming, which show a dramatic increase of 0.6&#176;C (10 a)<sup>−1</sup> during the period 1981–2006.</p>

				<title>First results from imaging riometer installed at Indian Antarctic station Maitri</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0593-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cosmic noise absorption (CNA) measurred by imaging riometer, is an excellent tool to passively study the high latitude D-region ionospheric conditions and dynamics. An imaging riometer has been installed at Indian Antarctic station Maitri (geographic 70.75&#176;S, 11.75&#176;E; corrected geomagnetic 63.11&#176;S, 53.59&#176;E) in February 2010. This is the first paper using the imaging riometer data from Maitri. The present paper introduces the details of this facility, including its instrumentation, related CNA theory and its applications. Sidereal shift of around 2 hours in the diurnal pattern validates the data obtained from the newly installed instrument. Moreover, the strength of cosmic noise signal on quiet days also varies with months. This is apparently due to solar ionization of D-region ionosphere causing enhanced electron density where collision frequency is already high. The main objective of installing the imaging riometer at Maitri is to study magneotspheric–ionospheric coupling during substorm processes. In the current study, we present two typical examples of disturbed time CNA associated with storm-time and non-storm time substorm. Results reveal that CNA is more pronounced during storm-time substorm as compared to nonstorm-time substorm. The level of CNA strongly depends upon the strengthening of convectional electric field and the duration of southward turning of interplanetary magnetic field before the substorm onset.</p>

				<title>Evidence of Late Quaternary seismicity from Yunam Tso, Lahaul  and Spiti, NW Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0603-0616</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A relict fluvio-lacustrine sediment of an 8 m thick section exposed at Kilang Sarai along Yunam river, near Baralacha La shows presence of cycloids or pseudonodules, ball and pillow structures, flame-like and pocket structures, sand dyke injections, bed dislocation/faulting and flow folds. Within this section four deformed levels of soft sediment structures have been identified which were dated ca. 25 ka BP at level 1 (∼0.4 m from the modern river level (mrl), 20.1 ka BP at level 2 (∼1.8 m mrl), 17.7 ka BP at level 3 (∼2.56 m mrl) and 12.2 ka BP at level 4 (∼4.25 m mrl)). Detailed study of these soft sediment structures allow us to demonstrate that deformation level 3 is not related to seismic trigger, but remaining three deformation levels (1, 2 and 4) are ascribed to seismic origin. From compilation of earlier palaeoseismological studies using soft sediment deformational structures (SSDS) in the palaeolake deposits in the adjoining area, suggest that the deformational events identified in the present study are regional in nature and thus tectonic process plays an important role in the evolution of landform in the Spiti region.</p>

					<p>In the last 10 years, several teams of geologists from different institutions in India and abroad have vigorously investigated the Chhattisgarh basin (Bastar craton, India). Based on the new results and the lithologs of more than 350 water wells, resistivity and gamma-ray logs, and extensive geological traverses, we present a revised geological map, relevant cross sections, a new comprehensive stratigraphic column and a discussion of the new findings. Major outcomes of this revision are: (1) confirming the existence of two sub-basins (Hirri and Baradwar) and two depocentres; (2) establishing the age of the basin to be essentially Mesoproterozoic; (3) discarding the ‘unclassified Pandaria formation’ and classifying the package of Pandaria rock units into Chandi, Tarenga, Hirri and Maniari formations in the Hirri subbasin; (4) accepting the ‘group’ status of the Singhora Group and the newly proposed Kharsiya Groups in the Baradwar sub-basin; (5) establishing an intrabasinal correlation of formations; (6) reappraising the thicknesses of the different formations; and (7) finding that the geometry of the basin is ‘bowl-shaped’, which is compatible with a sag model for the origin and evolution of the basin.</p>

				<title>Bathymetric preference of four major genera of rectilinear benthic foraminifera within oxygen minimum zone in Arabian Sea off central west coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0633-0639</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fifty two surface sediment samples collected from the region off Goa, central west coast of India from water depths of 15–3300 m were analyzed with special emphasis on foraminiferal content. Rectilinear benthic foraminiferal morphogroup shows a high relative abundance within Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ), both shallow marine (50–60 m water depth) and intermediate to deep water (150–1500 m water depth). We gave special emphasis on four rectilinear foraminiferal genera, namely <i>Fursenkoina, Bolivina, Bulimina</i> and <i>Uvigerina</i> to observe their individual distribution among OMZ. We found genus <i>Fursenkoina</i> predominates at the shallow water OMZ, within the water depth zone of 50–60 m. Within 150–1500 m water depth, which is considered as intermediate to deep water OMZ in this region, genus <i>Uvigerina</i> shows its highest abundance above 1000 m water depth, whereas genus <i>Bulimina</i> shows its affinity with deeper water environment (&lt; 1000 m water depth). Genus <i>Bolivina</i> does not show any such depth preference, except its higher abundance in only intermediate to deep water OMZ. This depth differentiation among four rectilinear benthic foraminiferal genera presents the basic data for palaeoclimatic study based on the extent and intensity of OMZ along with the palaeobathymetry study.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of brightness temperature from a forward model of ground-based microwave radiometer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0641-0650</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ground-based microwave radiometers are getting great attention in recent years due to their capability to profile the temperature and humidity at high temporal and vertical resolution in the lower troposphere. The process of retrieving these parameters from the measurements of radiometric brightness temperature ($T_B$) includes the inversion algorithm, which uses the background information from a forward model. In the present study, an algorithm development and evaluation of this forward model for a ground-based microwave radiometer, being developed by Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research (SAMEER) of India, is presented. Initially, the analysis of absorption coefficient and weighting function at different frequencies was made to select the channels. Further the range of variation of $T_B$ for these selected channels for the year 2011, over the two stations Mumbai and Delhi is discussed. Finally the comparison between forward-model simulated $T_B$s and radiometer measured $T_B$s at Mahabaleshwar (73.66&#176;E and 17.93&#176;N) is done to evaluate the model. There is good agreement between model simulations and radiometer observations, which suggests that these forward model simulations can be used as background for inversion models for retrieving the temperature and humidity profiles.</p>

				<title>Spatial heterogeneity in near surface aerosol characteristics across the Brahmaputra valley</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0651-0663</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to examine the spatial variability of the aerosol characteristics across the Brahmaputra valley, a land campaign was conducted during late winter (February 3–March 2) 2011. Measurements of particulate matter (PM, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and black carbon (BC) concentrations were made onboard an interior redesigned vehicle. The length of the campaign trail stretched about 700 km, covering the longitude belt of 89.97&#176;–95.55&#176;E and latitude belt of 26.1&#176;–27.6&#176;N, comprising 13 measurement locations. The valley is divided into three sectors longitudinally: western sector (R1: 89.97&#176;–91.75&#176;E), middle sector (R2: 92.5&#176;–94.01&#176;E) and eastern sector (R3: 94.63&#176;–95.55&#176;E). Spatial heterogeneity in aerosol distribution has been observed with higher PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at the western and middle sectors compared to the eastern sector. The locations in the western sector are found to be rich in BC compared to the other two sectors and there is a gradual decrease in BC concentrations from west to east of the Brahmaputra valley. Two hotspots within the western and middle sectors with high PM and BC concentrations have been identified. The associated physico-optical parameters of PM reveal abundance of $PM_{2.5}$ aerosols along the entire valley. High population density in the western and middle sectors, together with the contribution of remote aerosols, leads to higher anthropogenic aerosols over those regions. Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) slightly underestimates the measured PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> at the eastern sector while the model overestimates the measurements at a number of locations in the western sector. In general, BC is underestimated by the model. The variation of BC within the campaign trail has not been adequately captured by the model leading to higher variance in the western locations as compared to the middle and eastern locations.</p>

				<title>MARSpline model for lead seven-day maximum and minimum air temperature prediction in Chennai, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0665-0672</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) based lead seven days minimum and maximum surface air temperature prediction system is modelled for station Chennai, India. To emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed system, comparison is made with the models created using statistical learning technique Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr). The analysis highlights that prediction accuracy of MARS models for minimum temperature forecast are promising for short-term forecast (lead days 1 to 3) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 1&#176;C and the prediction efficiency and skill degrades in medium term forecast (lead days 4 to 7) with slightly above 1&#176;C. The MAE of maximum temperature is little higher than minimum temperature forecast varying from 0.87&#176;C for day-one to 1.27&#176;C for lag day-seven with MARS approach. The statistical error analysis emphasizes that MARS models perform well with an average 0.2&#176;C of reduction in MAE over SVMr models for all ahead seven days and provide significant guidance for the prediction of temperature event. The study also suggests that the correlation between the atmospheric parameters used as predictors and the temperature event decreases as the lag increases with both approaches.</p>

				<title>Trends in seasonal temperatures over the Indian region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0673-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An investigation has been carried out to identify the trends in maximum, minimum and mean temperatures and temperature range over the Indian land mass during the winter (January, and February), premonsoon (March–May), southwest monsoon (June–September) and post-monsoon (October–December) seasons by using high resolution daily gridded data set prepared by India Meteorological Department for the period of 1969–2005. It has been observed that the maximum temperatures over the west coast of India show rising trend in winter, southwest monsoon and post-monsoon seasons but the maximum temperatures do not show any significant trend over the other parts of the country. Minimum temperatures show increasing trend over the North Indian states in all seasons and they show an increasing trend over the west coast of India in winter and southwest monsoon seasons. Mean temperature shows an increasing trend over the west coast of India during winter and southwest monsoon seasons. Decreasing trend is observed in the temperature range over North India in all seasons due to increasing trend in minimum temperature.</p>

				<title>Analysis of stability parameters in relation to precipitation associated with pre-monsoon thunderstorms over Kolkata, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0689-0703</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The upper air RS/RW (Radio Sonde/Radio Wind) observations at Kolkata (22.65N, 88.45E) during premonsoon season March–May, 2005–2012 is used to compute some important dynamic/thermodynamic parameters and are analysed in relation to the precipitation associated with the thunderstorms over Kolkata, India. For this purpose, the pre-monsoon thunderstorms are classified as light precipitation (LP), moderate precipitation (MP) and heavy precipitation (HP) thunderstorms based on the magnitude of associated precipitation. Richardson number in non-uniformly saturated ($R_i$*) and saturated atmosphere ($R_i$); vertical shear of horizontal wind in 0–3, 0–6 and 3–7 km atmospheric layers; energy-helicity index (EHI) and vorticity generation parameter (VGP) are considered for the analysis. The instability measured in terms of Richardson number in non-uniformly saturated atmosphere ($R_i$∗) well indicate the occurrence of thunderstorms about 2 hours in advance. Moderate vertical wind shear in lower troposphere (0–3 km) and weak shear in middle troposphere (3–7 km) leads to heavy precipitation thunderstorms. The wind shear in 3–7 km atmospheric layers, EHI and VGP are good predictors of precipitation associated with thunderstorm. Lower tropospheric wind shear and Richardson number is a poor discriminator of the three classified thunderstorms.</p>

				<title>Hydrologic modelling of the effect of snowmelt and temperature on a mountainous watershed</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0705-0713</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Snowmelt-runoff modelling in a mountainous basin is perceived as difficult due to the complexity of simulation. Theoretically, the snowmelt process should be influenced by temperature changes. It is still controversial as how to incorporate the temperature changes into the snowmelt-runoff model in a mountainous basin. This paper presents the results of a study in the North Fork American River basin where the snowmelt-runoff mechanism is modelled by relating the temperature changes to the elevation band in the basin. In this study, a distributed hydrologic model is used to explore the orographic effects on the snowmelt-runoff using the snowfall-snowmelt routine in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Three parameters, namely maximum snowmelt factor, minimum snowmelt factor, and snowpack temperature lag were analysed during the simulation. The model was validated using streamflow data from October 1, 1991 to September 30, 1994, with and without considering the elevation band. The result of this study suggests that the snowmelt-runoff model associated with the elevation band better represents the snowmelt-runoff mechanism in terms of Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (E<sub>NS</sub>), ${R}^{2}$, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).</p>

				<title>Spatial control of groundwater contamination, using principal component analysis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0715-0728</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A study on the geochemistry of groundwater was carried out in a river basin of Andhra Pradesh to probe into the spatial controlling processes of groundwater contamination, using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA transforms the chemical variables, pH, EC, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, HCO$^{−}_{3}$, Cl<sup>−</sup>, SO$^{2−}_{4}$, NO$^{−}_{3}$ and F<sup>−</sup>, into two orthogonal principal components (PC1 and PC2), accounting for 75% of the total variance of the data matrix. PC1 has high positive loadings of EC, Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, SO$^{2−}_{4}$, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, representing a salinity controlled process of geogenic (mineral dissolution, ion exchange, and evaporation), anthropogenic (agricultural activities and domestic wastewaters), and marine (marine clay) origin. The PC2 loadings are highly positive for HCO$^{−}_{3}$, F<sup>−</sup>, pH and NO$^{−}_{3}$, attributing to the alkalinity and pollution controlled processes of geogenic and anthropogenic origins. The PC scores reflect the change of groundwater quality of geogenic origin from upstream to downstream area with an increase in concentration of chemical variables, which is due to anthropogenic and marine origins with varying topography, soil type, depth of water levels, and water usage. Thus, the groundwater quality shows a variation of chemical facies from Na<sup>+</sup> &#62; Ca<sup>2+</sup> &#62; Mg<sup>2+</sup> &#62; K<sup>+</sup>: HCO$^{−}_{3}$ &#62; Cl<sup>−</sup> &#62; SO$^{2−}_{4}$ &#62; NO$^{−}_{3}$ &#62; F<sup>−</sup> at high topography to Na<sup>+</sup> &#62; Mg<sup>2+</sup> &#62; Ca<sup>2+</sup> &#62; K<sup>+</sup>: Cl<sup>−</sup> &#62; HCO$^{−}_{3}$ &#62; SO$^{2−}_{4}$ &#62; NO$^{−}_{3}$ &#62; F<sup>−</sup> at low topography. With PCA, an effective tool for the spatial controlling processes of groundwater contamination, a subset of explored wells is indexed for continuous monitoring to optimize the expensive effort.</p>

				<page>0729-0740</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present investigation was made to characterize spatial and temporal variations in soil properties and to evaluate possible differences that could be dependent on the tannery effluent discharges, municipal sewage discharges, vegetation cover, soil settlement rate, crop rotation, etc. Soil total organic matter (TOM), cations like, Sodium (Na), Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) contents in the bank soils and bottom sediments were recorded from seven different characteristic sites in East Kolkata wetland ecosystem, a Ramsar site (Ramsar site No. 1208). The profile maps were constructed by geostatistical methods to describe the spatial distribution as well as temporal variations of all the factors to identify the influences of composite wastewaters. The work was initiated to identify causes and consequences of the waste dumping in the concerned region for the past hundred years and thereby to suggest necessary precautionary measures to prevent further loss of soil quality.</p>

					<p>Soil heat flux is an important input component of surface energy balance. Estimates of soil heat flux were made in the year 2008 using soil temperature data at Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram, south Kerala. Hourly values of soil heat flux from 00 to 24 LST are presented for selected days typical of the winter, pre-monsoon, SW monsoon and NE monsoon seasons. The diurnal variation is characterized by a cross-over from negative to positive values at 0700 h, occurrence of maximum around noon and return to negative values in the late evening. The energy storage term for the soil layer 0–0.05 m is calculated and the ground heat flux 𝐺∗ is estimated in all seasons. Daytime surface energy balance at the surface on wet and dry seasons is investigated. The average Bowen’s ratio during the wet and dry seasons were 0.541 and 0.515, respectively indicating that considerable evaporation takes place at the surface. The separate energy balance components were examined and the mean surface energy balance closure was found to be 0.742 and 0.795 for wet and dry seasons, respectively. When a new method that accounts for both soil thermal conduction and soil thermal convection was adopted to calculate the surface heat flux, the energy balance closure was found to be improved. Thus on the land surface under study, the soil vertical water movement is significant.</p>

				<title>Ionospheric foF2 morphology and response of F2 layer height over Jicamarca during different solar epochs and comparison with IRI-2012 model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0751-0765</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diurnal, seasonal and annual foF2 variability and the response of the F2-layer height over Jicamarca (11.9&#176;S, 76.8&#176;W, 1&#176;N dip) during periods of low (LSA), moderate (MSA) and high (HSA) solar activities was investigated. The relative standard deviation ($V_R$) was used for the analysis. The F2-layer critical frequency pre-noon peak increases by a factor of 2 more than the post-noon peak as the solar activity increases. The variability coefficient ($V_R$) is lowest during the day (7–16%) for the three solar epochs; increases during nighttime (20–26%, 14–26%, and 10–20%, respectively for the LSA, MSA and HAS years); and attained highest magnitude during sunrise (21–27%, 24–27%, and 19–30%, respectively in similar order). Two major peaks were observed in $V_R$ – the pre-sunrise peak, which is higher, and the post-sunset peak. Generally, the variability increases as the solar activity decreases. Annually, $V_R$ peaks within 23–24%, 19–24% and 15–24% for the LSA, MSA, and HSA periods, respectively. The ionospheric F2-layer height rises to the higher level with increasing solar activity. The foF2 comparison results revealed that Jicamarca is well represented on the IRI-2012 model, with an improvement on the URSI option. The importance of vertical plasma drift and photochemistry in the F2-layer was emphasized.</p>

				<title>Ionospheric correction for spaceborne single-frequency GPS based on single layer model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0767-0778</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A modified ionospheric correction method and the corresponding approximate algorithm for spaceborne single-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) users are proposed in this study. Single Layer Model (SLM) mapping function for spaceborne GPS was analyzed. SLM mapping functions at different altitudes were calculated. Ionospheric Pierce Point (IPP) trajectories of the dlft station (an IGS station located at the longitude of 4&#176; 23&#8242; 15.22&#8242;&#8242;E and the latitude of 51&#176; 59&#8242; 9.63&#8242;&#8242;N, in the TU Delft University, The Netherlands) and the GRACE satellite were computed with the corresponding single layer height of 350 and 500 km, respectively. The Klobuchar model was used to compute ionospheric delays for the dlft station, and modified Klobuchar model, together with scale factors, was used to compute the fractional ionospheric corrections above the GRACE altitudes. Calculation results were validated using dual-frequency observations. The study shows that the single layer height needs to be changed from 350 to 500 km according to the altitude of GRACE. Approximate forms of Earth angle and slant factor developed for modified Klobuchar model are applicable to GRACE, with accuracy adequate to preserve the essential elements required to compute ionospheric delays. Results show that the Klobuchar model is effective for ground GPS, and the modified Klobuchar model corrects more than 80% on average of the ionospheric delays for spaceborne single-frequency GPS.</p>

				<title>Experimental comparison of support vector machines with random forests for hyperspectral image land cover classification</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0779-0790</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The performances of regular support vector machines and random forests are experimentally compared for hyperspectral imaging land cover classification. Special characteristics of hyperspectral imaging dataset present diverse processing problems to be resolved under robust mathematical formalisms such as image classification. As a result, pixel purity index algorithm is used to obtain endmember spectral responses from Indiana pine hyperspectral image dataset. The generalized reduced gradient optimization algorithm is thereafter executed on the research data to estimate fractional abundances in the hyperspectral image and thereby obtain the numeric values for land cover classification. The Waikato environment for knowledge analysis (WEKA) data mining framework is selected as a tool to carry out the classification process by using support vector machines and random forests classifiers. Results show that performance of support vector machines is comparable to that of random forests. This study makes a positive contribution to the problem of land cover classification by exploring generalized reduced gradient method, support vector machines, and random forests to improve producer accuracy and overall classification accuracy. The performance comparison of these classifiers is valuable for a decision maker to consider tradeoffs in method accuracy <i>versus</i> method complexity.</p>

				<title>A comparative study for the estimation of geodetic point velocity by artificial neural networks</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0791-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Space geodesy era provides velocity information which results in the positioning of geodetic points by considering the time evolution. The geodetic point positions on the Earth’s surface change over time due to plate tectonics, and these changes have to be accounted for geodetic purposes. The velocity field of geodetic network is determined from GPS sessions. Velocities of the new structured geodetic points within the geodetic network are estimated from this velocity field by the interpolation methods. In this study, the utility of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) widely applied in diverse fields of science is investigated in order to estimate the geodetic point velocities. Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) are used to estimate the geodetic point velocities. In order to evaluate the performance of ANNs, the velocities are also interpolated by Kriging (KRIG) method. The results are compared in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) over five different geodetic networks. It was concluded that the estimation of geodetic point velocity by BPANN is more effective and accurate than by KRIG when the points to be estimated are more than the points known.</p>

				<title>Resolution of multiple sheet-type structures in self-potential measurement</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0809-0825</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The resolution of self-potential anomalies due to closely spaced multiple sheet-like bodies by the potential difference and potential gradient is studied in this paper. Self-potential anomalies due to several synthetic models were inverted through a very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) global optimization. Increase in depth to the top, polarization constant and depth extent of the body decreases resolution at a particular target separation. It has been observed that depth to the top and separation between two targets play an important role in the resolution. Vertical sheets at equal depth can be resolved in the potential difference measurement only if they are separated by at least four times their depth, while they can be resolved in the gradient method, if they are separated by twice the depth. Resolution using potential difference becomes more difficult for dipping sheets, although the potential gradient method can resolve them efficiently. Efficacy of potential gradient data in the inversion is demonstrated in the study using synthetic data as well as field measurement from South Purulia Shear Zone related with uranium investigation.</p>

				<title>Mantle electrical conductivity profile of Niger delta region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0827-0835</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mantle electrical conductivity-depth profile of the Niger delta region in Nigeria has been determined using solar quiet day ionospheric current (Sq).The magnetometer data obtained in 2010 from geomagnetic stations installed in Lagos by magnetic dataset (MAGDAS) in 2008 and data from magnetometers installed in some parts of Niger delta by Center for Basic Space Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, were employed in this study. Gauss spherical harmonic analysis (SHA) method was used to separate the internal and external field contributions to Sq current system. The result depicted that the conductivity profile rose steadily from about 0.032 S/m at a depth of 89 km to 0.041 S/m at 100 km and 0.09 S/m at 221 km. This high conductivity region agreed with the global seismic low velocity region, the asthenosphere. The conductivity profile continued increasing downward until it got to 0.157 S/m at a depth of about 373 km (close to the base of upper mantle), 0.201 S/m at 784 km and reached 0.243 S/m at a depth of 1179 km at the lower mantle.</p>

				<title>Comprehensive seismic hazard assessment of Tripura and Mizoram states</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0837-0857</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Northeast India is one of the most highly seismically active regions in the world with more than seven earthquakes on an average per year of magnitude 5.0 and above. Reliable seismic hazard assessment could provide the necessary design inputs for earthquake resistant design of structures in this region. In this study, deterministic as well as probabilistic methods have been attempted for seismic hazard assessment of Tripura and Mizoram states at bedrock level condition. An updated earthquake catalogue was collected from various national and international seismological agencies for the period from 1731 to 2011. The homogenization, declustering and data completeness analysis of events have been carried out before hazard evaluation. Seismicity parameters have been estimated using G–R relationship for each source zone. Based on the seismicity, tectonic features and fault rupture mechanism, this region was divided into six major subzones. Region specific correlations were used for magnitude conversion for homogenization of earthquake size. Ground motion equations (Atkinson and Boore 2003; Gupta 2010) were validated with the observed PGA (peak ground acceleration) values before use in the hazard evaluation. In this study, the hazard is estimated using linear sources, identified in and around the study area. Results are presented in the form of PGA using both DSHA (deterministic seismic hazard analysis) and PSHA (probabilistic seismic hazard analysis) with 2 and 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years, and spectral acceleration (T = 0. 2 s, 1.0 s) for both the states (2% probability of exceedance in 50 years). The results are important to provide inputs for planning risk reduction strategies, for developing risk acceptance criteria and financial analysis for possible damages in the study area with a comprehensive analysis and higher resolution hazard mapping.</p>

				<title>Geochronology and Hf–Fe isotopic geochemistry of the Phanerozoic mafic–ultramafic intrusions in the Damiao area, northern North China Craton: Implications for lithospheric destruction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0859-0873</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Timing and source of several Fe-mineralized mafic–ultramafic intrusions in the Damiao area are investigated here by coupling new geochronological and Hf–Fe isotopic data with previous results. Although regarded as a Late Paleoproterozoic assemblage previously, two ∼140 Ma intrusions are recognized by zircon U–Pb dating, indicating emplacement of these intrusions from Middle Devonian to Early Cretaceous times. Both Hf and Fe isotopic features lead to the conclusion that distinct mantle components contributed to their magma generation. As the first magmatic phase, the ∼395 Ma intrusions were mainly derived from the slightly-enriched SCLM that was prevalent during the Paleozoic. However, asthenospheric material was strongly involved in the formation of the ∼215 Ma Gaositai intrusion. Therefore, the initiation of lithospheric destruction in the northern NCC is inferred to have occurred in Late Triassic time, triggered by post-orogenic extension following the ∼250 Ma collision between the Siberian Craton and the NCC. The ∼140 Ma intrusions originated from a significantly-enriched mantle component probably resided in the predominant slightly-enriched SCLM. This mantle source would have melted in the Late Mesozoic, when the thin lithosphere enabled enhanced heat transfer from the asthenosphere. In summary, these distinct mantle sources of mafic–ultramafic magmatism provide a record of mantle heterogeneity and the gradual upward migration of the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary during lithospheric destruction.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The Pulang complex is located tectonically at the southern margin of the Yidun–Zhongdian island arc belt in Yunnan province, China, and is closely related to formation of the Pulang copper deposit, which is the largest copper deposit in Asia. The Pulang complex can be divided into three intrusion stages based on contact relationships and petrological characteristics: (1) a first stage of quartz dioritic porphyry; (2) a second stage of quartz monzonitic porphyry; and (3) a third stage of granodioritic porphyry. The crystallization ages of these intrusion stages were determined by single-zircon U–Pb dating, yielding ages of 221.0 ± 1.0, 211.8 ± 0.5, and 206.3 ± 0.7 Ma for the first, second, and third stages, respectively. These dates, integrated with previous geochronological data and field investigations, indicate that the second-stage quartz monzonitic porphyry has a close spatial and temporal relationship with the large Pulang porphyry copper deposit. These age data, geochemical and Sr–Nd isotopic results suggest that the Pulang complex formed in the Indo-Chinese epoch (257 ∼ 05 Ma) by multiphase intrusion of a mixture of mantle- and crust-derived magmas.</p>

				<title>Mineralogical and chemical character- istics of newer Dolerite Dyke around Keonjhar, Orissa: Implication for hydrothermal activity in subduction zone setting</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0887-0904</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The newer dolerite dykes around Keonjhar within the Singbhum Granite occur in NE–SW, NW–SE and NNE–SSW trends. The mafic dykes of the present study exhibit several mineralogical changes like clouding of plagioclase feldspars, bastitisation of orthopyroxene, and development of fibrous amphibole (tremolite–actinolite) from clinopyroxene, which are all considered products of hydrothermal alterations. This alteration involves addition and subtraction of certain elements. Graphical analyses with alteration index and elemental abundances show that elements like Rb, Ba, Th, La and K have been added during the alteration process, whereas elements like Sc, Cr, Co, Ni, Si, Al, Fe, Mg and Ca have been removed. It is observed that in spite of such chemical alteration, correlation between major and trace elements, characteristic of petrogenetic process, is still preserved. This might reflect systematic alteration (addition or subtraction) of elements without disturbing the original element to element correlation. It has also been established by earlier workers that the evolution of newer dolerite had occurred in an arc-back arc setting which may also be true for newer dolerites of the present study. This is evident from plots of pyroxene composition and whole rock composition of newer dolerite samples in different tectonic discrimination diagrams using immobile elements. The newer dolerite dykes of the Keonjhar area may thus be considered to represent an example of hydrothermal activity on mafic rocks in an arc setting.</p>

				<title>Identification and characterization of tsunami deposits off southeast coast of India from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami: Rock magnetic and geochemical approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0905-0921</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT) had a major impact on the geomorphology and sedimentology of the east coast of India. Estimation of the magnitude of the tsunami from its deposits is a challenging topic to be developed in studies on tsunami hazard assessment. Two core sediments (C1 and C2) from Nagapattinam, southeast coast of India were subjected to textural, mineral, geochemical and rock-magnetic measurements. In both cores, three zones (zone I, II and III) have been distinguished based on mineralogical, geochemical and magnetic data. Zone II is featured by peculiar rockmagnetic, textural, mineralogical and geochemical signatures in both sediment cores that we interpret to correspond to the 2004 IOT deposit. Textural, mineralogical, geochemical and rock-magnetic investigations showed that the tsunami deposit is featured by relative enrichment in sand, quartz, feldspar, carbonate, SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>O and CaO and by a depletion in clay and iron oxides. These results point to a dilution of reworked ferromagnetic particles into a huge volume of paramagnetic materials, similar to what has been described in other nearshore tsunami deposits (Font <i>et al</i>. 2010). Correlation analysis elucidated the relationships among the textural, mineral, geochemical and magnetic parameters, and suggests that most of the quartz-rich coarse sediments have been transported offshore by the tsunami wave. These results agreed well with the previously published numerical model of tsunami induced sediment transport off southeast coast of India and can be used for future comparative studies on tsunami deposits.</p>

				<title>Molecular fossils in Cretaceous condensate from western India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0923-0934</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study reports the biomarker distribution of condensate belonging to the early Cretaceous time frame using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The early Cretaceous palaeoenvironment was inscribed into these molecular fossils which reflected the source and conditions of deposition of the condensate. The saturate fraction of the condensate is characterized by normal alkanes ranging from 𝑛-C_{9} to 𝑛-C_{29} (CPI-1.13), cycloalkanes and C_{14} and C_{15} sesquiterpanes. The aromatic fraction comprises of naphthalene, phenanthrene, their methylated derivatives and cyclohexylbenzenes. Isohexylalkylnaphthalenes, a product of rearrangement process of terpenoids, is detected in the condensate. Several aromatic sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids have been recorded. Dihydro-<i>ar</i>-curcumene, cadalene and ionene form the assemblage of sesquiterpenoids which are indicative of higher plant input. Aromatic diterpenoid fraction comprises of simonellite and retene. These compounds are also indicative of higher plants, particularly conifer source which had been a predominant flora during the Cretaceous time.</p>

				<title>Molecular composition and paleobotanical origin of Eocene resin from northeast India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0935-0941</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The molecular composition of fossil resins from early to middle Eocene coal from northeast India, has been analyzed for the first time to infer their paleobotanical source. The soluble component of fossil resin was analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The resin extracts are composed of cadalene-based C_{15} sesquiterpenoids and diagenetically altered triterpenoids. The macromolecular composition was investigated using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The major pyrolysis products are C_{15} bicyclic sesquiterpenoids, alkylated naphthalenes, benzenes and a series of C_{17}–C_{34} 𝑛-alkene-𝑛-alkane pairs. Spectroscopic analysis revealed the dominance of aliphatic components. The presence of cadalene-based sequiterpenoids confirms the resin to be Class II or dammar resin, derived from angiosperms of Dipterocarpaceae family. These sesquiterpenoids are often detected in many SE Asian fluvio-deltaic oils. Dipterocarpaceae are characteristic of warm tropical climate suggesting the prevalence of such climate during early Eocene in northeast India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The dominantly high-K, moderate to high SiO<sub>2</sub> containing, variably fractionated, volcanic-arc granitoids (± sheared) from parts of Bundelkhand craton, northcentral India are observed to contain molybdenite (Mo) in widely separated 23 locations in the form of specks, pockets, clots and stringers along with quartz ± pyrite ± arsenopyrite ± chalcopyrite ± bornite ± covellite ± galena ± sphalerite and in invisible form as well. The molybdenite mineralization is predominantly associated with Bundelkhand Tectonic Zone, Raksa Shear Zone, and localized shear zones. The incidence of molybdenite is also observed within sheared quartz and tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) gneisses. The fluid inclusion data show the presence of bi-phase (H<sub>2</sub>O–CO<sub>2</sub>), hypersaline and moderate temperature (100&#176;–300&#176;C) primary stretched fluid inclusions suggesting a possible hydrothermal origin for the Mo-bearing quartz occurring within variably deformed different granitoids variants of Archean Bundelkhand craton.</p>

				<title>Geochemical constraints on the evolution of mafic and felsic rocks in the Bathani volcanic and volcano-sedimentary sequence of Chotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0959-0987</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Bathani volcanic and volcano-sedimentary (BVS) sequence is a volcanic and volcano-sedimentary sequence, best exposed near Bathani village in Gaya district of Bihar. It is located in the northern fringe of the Chotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex (CGGC). The volcano-sedimentary unit comprises of garnet-mica schist, rhyolite, tuff, banded iron formation (BIF) and chert bands with carbonate rocks as enclaves within the rhyolite and the differentiated volcanic sequence comprises of rhyolite, andesite, pillow basalt, massive basalt, tuff and mafic pyroclasts. Emplacement of diverse felsic and mafic rocks together testifies for a multi-stage and multi-source magmatism for the area. The presence of pillow basalt marks the eruption of these rocks in a subaqueous environment. Intermittent eruption of mafic and felsic magmas resulted in the formation of rhyolite, mafic pyroclasts, and tuff. Mixing and mingling of the felsic and mafic magmas resulted in the hybrid rock andesite. Granites are emplaced later, crosscutting the volcanic sequence and are probably products of fractional crystallization of basaltic magma. The present work characterizes the geochemical characteristics of the magmatic rocks comprising of basalt, andesite, rhyolite, tuff, and granite of the area. Tholeiitic trend for basalt and calc-alkaline affinities of andesite, rhyolite and granite is consistent with their generation in an island arc, subduction related setting. The rocks of the BVS sequence probably mark the collision of the northern and southern Indian blocks during Proterozoic period. The explosive submarine volcanism may be related to culmination of the collision of the aforementioned blocks during the Neoproterozoic (1.0 Ga) as the Grenvillian metamorphism is well established in various parts of CGGC.</p>

				<title>Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd isotope systematics and geochemical studies on metavolcanic rocks from Peddavura greenstone belt: Evidence for presence of Mesoarchean continental crust in easternmost part of Dharwar Craton, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0989-1011</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linear, north–south trending Peddavura greenstone belt occurs in easternmost part of the Dharwar Craton. It consists of pillowed basalts, basaltic andesites, andesites (BBA) and rhyolites interlayered with ferruginous chert that were formed under submarine condition. Rhyolites were divided into type-I and II based on their REE abundances and HREE fractionation. Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd isotope studies were carried out on the rock types to understand the evolution of the Dharwar Craton. Due to source heterogeneity Sm–Nd isotope system has not yielded any precise age. Rb–Sr whole-rock isochron age of 2551 ± 19 (MSWD = 1.16) Ma for BBA group could represent time of seafloor metamorphism after the formation of basaltic rocks. Magmas representing BBA group of samples do not show evidence for crustal contamination while magmas representing type-II rhyolites had undergone variable extents of assimilation of Mesoarchean continental crust (&lt; 3.3 Ga) as evident from their initial 𝜀<sub>Nd</sub> isotope values. Trace element and Nd isotope characteristics of type I rhyolites are consistent with model of generation of their magmas by partial melting of mixed sources consisting of basalt and oceanic sediments with continental crustal components. Thus this study shows evidence for presence of Mesoarchean continental crust in Peddavura area in eastern part of Dharwar Craton.</p>

				<title>Earthquake source characteristics along the arcuate Himalayan belt: Geodynamic implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1013-1030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrences of moderate to large magnitude earthquakes and associated subsurface geological processes were critically examined in the backdrop of Indian plate obliquity, stress obliquity, topography, and the late Tertiary regional tectonics for understanding the evolving dynamics and kinematics in the central part of the Himalayas. The higher topographic areas are likely associated with the zones of depressions, and the lower topographic areas are found around the ridges located in the frontal part of the orogen. A positive correlation between plate and stress obliquities is established for this diffuse plate boundary. We propose that the zone of sharp bending of the descending Indian lithosphere is the nodal area of major stress accumulation which is released occasionally in form of earthquakes. The lateral geometry of the Himalayas shows clusters of seismicity at an angle of ∼20&#176; from the centre part of the arc. Such spatial distribution is interpreted in terms of compression across the arc and extension parallel to the arc. This biaxial deformation results in the development of dilational shear fractures, observed along the orogenic belt, at an angle of ∼20&#176; from the principal compressive stress axis.</p>

				<title>Hydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater in Kashmir Valley, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1031-1043</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Groundwater samples (𝑛 = 163) were collected across Kashmir Valley in 2010 to assess the hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater in shallow and deep aquifers and its suitability for domestic, agriculture, horticulture, and livestock purposes. The groundwater is generally alkaline in nature. The electrical conductivity (EC) which is an index to represent the total concentration of soluble salts in water was used to measure the salinity hazard to crops as it reflects the TDS in groundwater ranging from 97 to 1385 𝜇S/cm, except one well in Sopore. The average concentration of major ions was higher in shallow aquifers than in deeper aquifers. In general, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the dominant cation and HCO$^{−}_{3}$ the dominant anion. Ca–HCO<sub>3</sub>, Mg–HCO<sub>3</sub>, Ca–Mg–HCO<sub>3</sub>, Na–HCO<sub>3</sub> were the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. High concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub> and pH less than 8.8 clearly indicated that intense chemical weathering processes have taken place in the study area. The groundwater flow pattern in the area follows the local surface topography which not only modifies the hydrogeochemical facies but also controls their distribution. The groundwater in valley flows into four directions, i.e., SW–NE, NE–W, SE–NW and SE–NE directions. The results suggest that carbonate dissolution is the dominant source of major ions followed by silicate weathering and ion-exchange processes. The concentrations of all the major ions determined in the present study are within the permissible limits ofWHO and BIS standards. The results of Total Hardness, SAR, Na%, Kelly Index, USDA classification, Magnesium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, and PI suggested that groundwater is good for drinking, livestock, and irrigation purposes.</p>

				<title>Observed intraseasonal and seasonal variability of the West India Coastal Current on the continental slope</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1045-1074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present current data from acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) moored on the continental slope off the west coast of India. The data were collected at four locations (roughly at Kanyakumari, Kollam, Goa, and Mumbai) extending from ∼7&#176; to ∼20&#176; N during 2008–2012. The observations show that a seasonal cycle, including an annual cycle, is present in the West India Coastal Current (WICC); this seasonal cycle, which strengthens northward, shows considerable interannual variability and is not as strongly correlated along the coast as in climatologies based on ship drifts or the altimeter. The alongshore decorrelation of theWICC is much stronger at intraseasonal periods, which are evident during the winter monsoon all along the coast. This intraseasonal variability is stronger in the south. A striking feature of the WICC is upward phase propagation, which implies an undercurrent whose depth becomes shallower as the season progresses. There are also instances when the phase propagates downward. At the two southern mooring locations off Kollam and Kanyakumari, the cross-shore current, which is usually associated with eddy-like circulations, is comparable to the alongshore current on occasions. A comparison with data from the OSCAR (Ocean Surface Currents Analyses Real-time) data product shows not only similarities, but also significant differences, particularly in the phase. One possible reason for this phase mismatch between the ADCP current at 48 m and the OSCAR current, which represents the current in the 0–30 m depth range, is the vertical phase propagation. Current products based on Ocean General Circulation Models like ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II) and GODAS (Global Ocean Data Assimilation System) show a weaker correlation with the ADCP current, and ECCO2 does capture some of the observed variability.</p>

				<title>An assessment of wind forcing impact on a spectral wave model for the Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1075-1087</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The focus of the present study is the assessment of the impact of wind forcing on the spectral wave model MIKE 21 SW in the Indian Ocean region. Three different wind fields, namely the ECMWF analyzed winds, the ECMWF blended winds, and the NCEP blended winds have been used to drive the model. The wave model results have been compared with <i>in-situ</i> observations and satellite altimeter data. This study also evaluated the performance of the wind products during local phenomenon like sea breeze, since it has a significant impact on the wave prediction in the Indian coastal region. Hence we explored the possibility of studying the impact of diurnal variation of winds on coastal waves using different wind fields. An analysis of the model performance has also been made during high wind conditions with the inference that blended winds generate more realistic wave fields in the high wind conditions and are able to produce the growth and decay of waves more realistically.</p>

				<title>Eddy covariance based methane flux in Sundarbans mangroves, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1089-1096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report the initial results of the methane flux measured using eddy covariance method during summer months from the world’s largest mangrove ecosystem, Sundarbans of India. Mangrove ecosystems are known sources for methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) having very high global warming potential. In order to quantify the methane flux in mangroves, an eddy covariance flux tower was recently erected in the largest unpolluted and undisturbed mangrove ecosystem in Sundarbans (India). The tower is equipped with eddy covariance flux tower instruments to continuously measure methane fluxes besides the mass and energy fluxes. This paper presents the preliminary results of methane flux variations during summer months (i.e., April and May 2012) in Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem. The mean concentrations of CH<sub>4</sub> emission over the study period was 1682 ± 956 ppb. The measured CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes computed from eddy covariance technique showed that the study area acts as a net source for CH<sub>4</sub> with daily mean flux of 150.22 ± 248.87 mg m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. The methane emission as well as its flux showed very high variability diurnally. Though the environmental conditions controlling methane emission is not yet fully understood, an attempt has been made in the present study to analyse the relationships of methane efflux with tidal activity. This present study is part of Indian Space Research Organisation–Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISRO–GBP) initiative under ‘National Carbon Project’.</p>

				<title>Sediment grain size and hydrodynamics in Mediterranean coastal lagoons: Integrated classification of abiotic parameters</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1097-1114</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Integrated classification maps were produced by combining sediment grain-size and hydrological data (water renewal time, WRT) from two Mediterranean lagoons, Lesina (LL) and Varano (LV), Italy. The geophysical characteristics of the two basins, derived from detailed bathymetric charts, are quite distinct: ∼30% of LL (mean depth ∼1 m) but only 3% of LV (mean depth ∼3 m) is shallower than 1 m. The sediments of both lagoons are mainly composed of mud (∼80%). A detailed multivariate analysis of grainsize data by EntropyMax classified the lagoon beds of LL and LV into five sedimentary facies. WRT data, computed by a hydrodynamic model, indicated different hydrological conditions in the two lagoons: LL showed a sharp west–east gradient, with a basin-wide average of ∼190 days, whilst LV showed a fairly uniform distribution and a higher basin-wide average (∼260 days). The distribution of sedimentary facies and water renewal times were combined in a composite map representing the distribution of environmental patterns. The approach outlined in this study can be used to improve zonation schemes by providing a hydromorphological perspective on transitional and coastal environments.</p>

				<title>Influence of soil moisture content on surface albedo and soil thermal parameters at a tropical station</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1115-1128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Half hourly data of soil moisture content, soil temperature, solar irradiance, and reflectance are measured during April 2010 to March 2011 at a tropical station, viz., Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India (76&#176; 59’E longitude and 8&#176;29’N latitude). The monthly, seasonal and seasonal mean diurnal variation of soil moisture content is analyzed in detail and is correlated with the rainfall measured at the same site during the period of study. The large variability in the soil moisture content is attributed to the rainfall during all the seasons and also to the evaporation/movement of water to deeper layers. The relationship of surface albedo on soil moisture content on different time scales are studied and the influence of solar elevation angle and cloud cover are also investigated. Surface albedo is found to fall exponentially with increase in soil moisture content. Soil thermal diffusivity and soil thermal conductivity are also estimated from the subsoil temperature profile. Log normal dependence of thermal diffusivity and power law dependence of thermal conductivity on soil moisture content are confirmed.</p>

				<title>Impact of monsoon rainfall on the total food grain yield over India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1129-1145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study focuses on understanding the variations of precipitation during summer monsoon season and its impact on Kharif and Rabi foodgrain yield over India. Total foodgrain yield over India during Kharif (summer) season is directly affected by variations in the summer monsoon precipitation (June–September). An increase (decrease) in rainfall is generally associated with an increase (decrease) in foodgrain yield. A similar correspondence during the Rabi (winter) foodgrain yield is not evident. The Rabi crop is not directly affected by variations in the post-monsoon precipitation (October–December) alone, also the summer season precipitation influences the Rabi crop through water and soil moisture availability over many parts of India. Though the reduction of rainfall activity during the entire summer monsoon season leads to reduction in crop yields, the occurrence of prolonged rainfall breaks also causes adverse effect on the crop growth resulting in reduced crop yields.</p>

				<title>Study of seasonal climatology and interannual variability over India and its subregions using a regional climate model (RegCM3)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1147-1169</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The temporal and spatial variability of the various meteorological parameters over India and its different subregions is high. The Indian subcontinent is surrounded by the complex Himalayan topography in north and the vast oceans in the east, west and south. Such distributions have dominant influence over its climate and thus make the study more complex and challenging. In the present study, the climatology and interannual variability of basic meteorological fields over India and its six homogeneous monsoon subregions (as defined by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) for all the four meteorological seasons) are analysed using the Regional Climate Model Version 3 (RegCM3). A 22-year (1980–2001) simulation with RegCM3 is carried out to develop such understanding. The National Centre for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research, US (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis 2 (NNRP2) is used as the initial and lateral boundary conditions. The main seasonal features and their variability are represented in model simulation. The temporal variation of precipitation, i.e., the mean annual cycle, is captured over complete India and its homogenous monsoon subregions. The model captured the contribution of seasonal precipitation to the total annual precipitation over India. The model showed variation in the precipitation contribution for some subregions to the total and seasonal precipitation over India. The correlation coefficient (CC) and difference between the coefficient of variation between model fields and the corresponding observations in percentage (COV) is calculated and compared. In most of the cases, the model could represent the magnitude but not the variability. The model processes are found to be more important than in the corresponding observations defining the variability. The model performs quite well over India in capturing the climatology and the meteorological process. The model shows good skills over the relevant subregions during a season.</p>

				<title>Location specific forecasting of maximum and minimum temperatures over India by using the statistical bias corrected output of global forecasting system</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1171-1195</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The output from Global Forecasting System (GFS) T574L64 operational at India Meteorological Department (IMD), New Delhi is used for obtaining location specific quantitative forecast of maximum and minimum temperatures over India in the medium range time scale. In this study, a statistical bias correction algorithm has been introduced to reduce the systematic bias in the 24–120 hour GFS model location specific forecast of maximum and minimum temperatures for 98 selected synoptic stations, representing different geographical regions of India. The statistical bias correction algorithm used for minimizing the bias of the next forecast is Decaying Weighted Mean (DWM), as it is suitable for small samples. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the skill of Direct Model Output (DMO) and Bias Corrected (BC) GFS for location specific forecast of maximum and minimum temperatures over India. The performance skill of 24–120 hour DMO and BC forecast of GFS model is evaluated for all the 98 synoptic stations during summer (May–August 2012) and winter (November 2012–February 2013) seasons using different statistical evaluation skill measures. The magnitude of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for BC GFS forecast is lower than DMO during both summer and winter seasons. The BC GFS forecasts have higher skill score as compared to GFS DMO over most of the stations in all day-1 to day-5 forecasts during both summer and winter seasons. It is concluded from the study that the skill of GFS statistical BC forecast improves over the GFS DMO remarkably and hence can be used as an operational weather forecasting system for location specific forecast over India.</p>

				<title>Observed seasonal and intraseasonal variability of the East India Coastal Current on the continental slope</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1197-1232</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present data from three acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) moored off Cuddalore (12&#176;N), Kakinada (16.5&#176;N), and Gopalpur (19&#176;N) on the continental slope of the western Bay of Bengal and one mooring on the slope of the northern bay (89&#176;E, 19&#176;N; referred to as being located at Paradip). The data were collected during May 2009 to March 2013 and the observations show that the seasonal cycle, which includes the annual cycle, the semi-annual cycle, and a peak around 120 days, dominates the observed variability of the East India Coastal Current (EICC). Spectral analysis suggests that the 120-day peak dominates the seasonal variability at Paradip and is strong at Gopalpur and Kakinada. The annual cycle is coherent along the western boundary of the bay, i.e., the east coast of India, but with significant phase differences between moorings. At the semi-annual and 120-day periods, the alongshore coherence is weaker. Intraseasonal variability is weaker than the seasonal cycle, particularly at Cuddalore and Paradip, and it exhibits seasonality: the strongest intraseasonal variation is during spring (February–April). Peaks around 12 and 20–22 days are also seen at Gopalpur, Kakinada, and Cuddalore. A striking feature of the currents is the upward phase propagation, but there are also instances when phase propagates downward. The much lower vertical phase speed in the top ∼100 m at Cuddalore leads to a distinct undercurrent at this location; at other locations, the undercurrent, though it exists often, is not as striking. During spring, however, the EICC tends to flow poleward (eastward) at Cuddalore, Kakinada, and Gopalpur (Paradip) over the top ∼300 m, which is the maximum depth to which observations were made. The cross-shore component of the EICC is much weaker than the alongshore component at Cuddalore and, except for a few bursts during spring, at Kakinada and Gopalpur. It is only at Paradip, on the slope of the northern boundary, that significant cross-shore flows are seen during spring and the summer monsoon (June–August) and these flows are seen to be associated with eddy-like circulations in the altimeter data. We use the ADCP data to validate popular current data products like OSCAR (Ocean Surface Currents Analyses Real-time), ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II), and GODAS (Global Ocean Data Assimilation System). The OSCAR currents at Paradip match the observed currents well, but the correlation is much weaker at the other three locations. Both ECCO2 and GODAS fair poorly, particularly the latter because its variability in this boundary-current regime is extremely weak. Though it performs badly at Paradip, ECCO2 does capture the observed variability on occasions at the other locations.</p>

				<title>Characterization of the atmospheric boundary layer from radiosonde observations along eastern end of monsoon trough of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1233-1240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a comparison of two methods for the calculation of the height of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), using balloon-borne GPS radiosonde data is presented. ABL has been characterized using vertical profiles of meteorological parameter. The gradient of virtual potential temperature (𝜃<sub>v</sub>) profile for the determination of mixed layer heights (MLH) and the mean value of turbulent flow depth (TFD) obtained from the vertical profile of Bulk Richardson Number ($R_{iB}$) have been used in this study. Oneyear data have been used for the study. There is large seasonal variability in MLH with a peak in the summer and winter whereas the TFD remained steady throughout the year. Results from the present study indicate that the magnitudes of TFD are often larger than the MLH.</p>

				<title>Measurement of soil-gas radon in some areas of northern Rajasthan, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1241-1247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The health hazards of the radioactive gas radon on general public are well known. In order to understand the level and distribution of <sup>222</sup>Rn concentrations in soil-gas in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, a <sup>222</sup>Rn survey was carried out for the first time using RAD7, an electronic radon detector manufactured by Durridge Company (USA), at different locations covering a total area of 10,978 km<sup>2</sup>, having a population of approximately 20 lakh. The measurement of <sup>222</sup>Rn concentration in soil-gas was carried out at four different depths (10, 40, 70, and 100 cm). The radon concentration in soil-gas for 10, 40, 70, and 100 cm depths ranged from 0.09–4.25, 0.15–6.30, 0.50–9.18, and 0.72–10.40 kBq m<sup>−3</sup>, respectively. The minimum value of radon concentration is observed in 33 GB village at 10 cm depth and maximum for Mohanpura village at 100 cm depth. As expected, our data show an increase of soil-gas radon concentration levels with depth. The present results are compared with the available radon data from other studies.</p>

				<title>Sensitivity of meteorological input and soil properties in simulating aerosols (dust, PM<sub>10</sub>, and BC) using CHIMERE chemistry transport model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1249-1264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of a European chemistry transport model, ‘CHIMERE’ driven by the US meteorological model MM5, in simulating aerosol concentrations [dust, PM<sub>10</sub> and black carbon (BC)] over the Indian region. An evaluation of a meteorological event (dust storm); impact of change in soil-related parameters and meteorological input grid resolution on these aerosol concentrations has been performed. Dust storm simulation over Indo-Gangetic basin indicates ability of the model to capture dust storm events. Measured (AERONET data) and simulated parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent are used to evaluate the performance of the model to capture the dust storm event. A sensitivity study is performed to investigate the impact of change in soil characteristics (thickness of the soil layer in contact with air, volumetric water, and air content of the soil) and meteorological input grid resolution on the aerosol (dust, PM<sub>10</sub>, BC) distribution. Results show that soil parameters and meteorological input grid resolution have an important impact on spatial distribution of aerosol (dust, PM<sub>10</sub>, BC) concentrations.</p>

				<title>Total column ozone retrieval using INSAT-3D sounder in the tropics: A simulation study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1265-1271</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study examines the potential of infrared sounder observations from Indian geostationary satellite INSAT-3D for the estimation of total column integrated ozone over the tropical Indian region. A dataset with diverse profiles was used to create training and testing datasets using forward simulations from a radiative transfer model for infrared sounder channels. A study was carried out for the standard tropical atmospheric profile to examine the sensitivity of ozone band radiance corresponding to the atmospheric temperature, water vapour, and ozone mixing ratios at different atmospheric pressure levels. Further, statistical retrieval technique has been used for the total column ozone estimation using two different approaches: (i) ozone channel observation along with the <i>a-priori</i> estimate of temperature and water vapour profile and (ii) only sounder channels observations. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithms was examined for different errors in the atmospheric profiles for the method (i) and different sensor noise specification for the method (ii). This study has shown that accurate temperature information is very important for ozone estimation and lower instrument noise results in better ozone estimates.</p>

				<title>Spread-F during the magnetic storm of 22 January 2004 at low latitudes: Effect of IMF-Bz in relation to local sunset time</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1273-1285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper describes the results of spread-F at low latitude stations around the world during the magnetic storm starting at 0130 UT on 22 January 2004. The storm can be divided into two phases, first phase up to 1000 UT when interplanetary magnetic field IMF-Bz was highly fluctuating around a small positive value and the second phase after a sudden large southward turning of IMF-Bz at 1030 UT. The first phase produced strong spread-F at Jicamarca, Sao Luis, and Ascension Island and caused complete inhibition of spread-F at Thumba and Waltair in India. It generated weak spread-F at Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and strong spread-F at Hainan and Chung Li. The strong spread-F at Hainan and Chung Li were caused by the positive IMF-Bz during the first phase of the storm and not by the negative pulse of IMF-Bz at 1000 UT.</p>

				<title>The application of a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal model for forecasting the SAA trapped particle flux distribution</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1287-1294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We implement a hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal (HBST) model to forecast the daily trapped particle flux distribution over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-15 data from 1–30 March 2008 with particle energies as &lt; 30 keV (mep0e1) and &lt; 300 keV (mep0e3) for electrons and 80–240 keV (mep0p2) and &lt;  6900 keV (mep0p6) for protons were used as the model input to forecast the flux values on 31 March 2008. Data were transformed into logarithmic values and gridded in a 5&#176; &#215; 5&#176; longitude and latitude size to fulfill the modeling precondition. A Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) was then performed to solve the HBST Gaussian Process (GP) model by using the Gibbs sampling method. The result for this model was interpolated by a Kriging technique to achieve the whole distribution figure over the SAA region. Statistical results of the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and bias (BIAS) showed a good indicator of the HBST method. The statistical validation also indicated the high variability of particle flux values in the SAA core area. The visual validation showed a powerful combination of HBST-GP model with Kriging interpolation technique. The Kriging also produced a good quality of the distribution map of particle flux over the SAA region as indicated by its small variance value. This suggests that the model can be applied in the development of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO)-Equatorial satellite for monitoring trapped particle radiation hazard.</p>

				<title>A hydrological simulation of the water regime in two playa lakes located in southern Spain</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1295-1305</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The subject of this paper is the detailed hydrological simulation of two playa lakes located in southern Spain from January 2011 to March 2012 on a daily basis. These playas are placed over a 400-km<sup>2</sup> shallow aquifer, which is exposed to an increasing stress caused by agricultural activities, mainly olive grove plantations. The objective of the paper is to elaborate a detailed numeric model that simulates the water regime of each playa lake on a daily scale. The simulation is compared to measured water level (WL) data of the playas in order to characterize the groundwater–surface interactions. The ultimate objective of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of the increasing anthropogenic water consumption within the area of research. The results of the GW–surface interaction were very consistent with previous works. One of the playa lakes is groundwater-dependent and the other one is presumably a perched playa lake. The GW discharge of the former playa (214 mm) during the research period stands in sharp contrast to no regional GW discharge in the latter. Water level data prove that the hydrological year (2011–2012) had a very negative water budget. The evapotranspiration estimation was almost as high as double the sum of the precipitation, the runoff, and the groundwater discharge. The simulation of an anthropologically altered water regime proves that water retrieval has a harmful impact on the WL of the playa lakes as well as on the aquifer.</p>

				<title>Response of bankfull discharge of the Inner Mongolia Yellow River to flow and sediment factors</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1307-1316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bankfull discharge is a comprehensive factor reflecting the channel-forming capability of water flow and the flood and sediment transport capacity of a river channel. It is based on the interaction of the flow, sediment, and river channel, of which flow and sediment conditions play crucial roles. Using data recorded since the 1950s, this paper analyses statistically, the characteristics and variations of bankfull discharge at two stations on the Inner Mongolian reaches of the upper Yellow River. Results indicate that flood season variations in bankfull discharge are nonlinear and are governed by flood peak discharge, mean discharge, and the mean incoming sediment coefficients. Variation in bankfull discharge is related not only to the flow and sediment conditions of the current year but also to those of previous years. The 10-year moving average of flow and sediment conditions can be representative of present and previous years. By considering flood season peak discharge and incoming sediment coefficients as independent impact factors, a formula is derived to determine bankfull discharge. The results can be used to predict the bankfull discharge of the Yellow River channel in Inner Mongolia under specific flow and sediment conditions and provide reference for the purpose of further study related to restoring and maintaining the basic functions of the river channel regarding flood discharge and sediments.</p>

				<title>Predictive permeability model of faults in crystalline rocks; verification by joint hydraulic factor (JH) obtained from water pressure tests</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1325-1334</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, a new model is proposed to predict the permeability per fracture in the fault zones by a new parameter named joint hydraulic factor (JH). JH is obtained from Water Pressure Test  WPT) and modified by the degree of fracturing. The results of JH correspond with quantitative fault zone descriptions, qualitative fracture, and fault rock properties. In this respect, a case study was done based on the data collected from Seyahoo dam site located in the east of Iran to provide the permeability prediction model of fault zone structures. Datasets including scan-lines, drill cores, and water pressure tests in the terrain of Andesite and Basalt rocks were used to analyse the variability of in-site relative permeability of a range from fault zones to host rocks. The rock mass joint permeability quality, therefore, is defined by the JH. JH data analysis showed that the background sub-zone had commonly &gt; 3 Lu (less of 5 &#215; 10<sup>−5</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s) per fracture, whereas the fault core had permeability characteristics nearly as low as the outer damage zone, represented by 8 Lu (1.3 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s) per fracture, with occasional peaks towards 12 Lu (2 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s) per fracture. The maximum JH value belongs to the inner damage zone, marginal to the fault core, with 14–22 Lu (2.3 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup> –3.6 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s) per fracture, locally exceeding 25 Lu (4.1 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s) per fracture. This gives a proportional relationship for JH approximately 1:4:2 between the fault core, inner damage zone, and outer damage zone of extensional fault zones in crystalline rocks. The results of the verification exercise revealed that the new approach would be efficient and that the JH parameter is a reliable scale for the fracture permeability change. It can be concluded that using short duration hydraulic tests (WPTs) and fracture frequency (FF) to calculate the JH parameter provides a possibility to describe a complex situation and compare, discuss, and weigh the hydraulic quality to make predictions as to the permeability models and permeation amounts of different zone structures.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>1335-1347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The basement of the Ganga basin in the Himalayan foreland is criss-crossed by several faults, dividing the basin into several sub-blocks forming horsts, grabens, or half-grabens. Tectonic perturbations along basement faults have affected the fluvial regime and extent of sediment fill in different parts of the basin during Late Quaternary. The East Patna Fault (EPF) and the West Patna Fault (WPF), located in Sone–Ganga alluvial tract in the southern marginal parts of Middle Ganga Plain (MGP), have remained tectonically active. The EPF particularly has acted significantly and influenced in evolving the geomorphological landscape and the stratigraphic architecture of the area. The block bounded by the two faults has earlier been considered as a single entity, constituting a half-graben. The present investigation (by morpho-stratigraphic and sedimentologic means) has revealed the existence of yet another fault within the half-graben, referred to as Bishunpur–Khagaul Fault (BKF). Many of the long profile morphological characters (e.g., knick-zone, low width–depth ratio) of the Sone River at its lower reaches can be ascribed to local structural deformation along BKF. These basement faults in MGP lie parallel to each other in NE–SW direction.</p>

				<title>Forest cover change prediction using hybrid methodology of geoinformatics and Markov chain model: A case study on sub-Himalayan town Gangtok, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1349-1360</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the Himalayan states of India, with increasing population and activities, large areas of forested land are being converted into other land-use features. There is a definite cause and effect relationship between changing practice for development and changes in land use. So, an estimation of land use dynamics and a futuristic trend pattern is essential. A combination of geospatial and statistical techniques were applied to assess the present and future land use/land cover scenario of Gangtok, the subHimalayan capital of Sikkim. Multi-temporal satellite imageries of the Landsat series were used to map the changes in land use of Gangtok from 1990 to 2010. Only three major land use classes (built-up area and bare land, step cultivated area, and forest) were considered as the most dynamic land use practices of Gangtok. The conventional supervised classification, and spectral indices-based thresholding using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) were applied along with the accuracy assessments. Markov modelling was applied for prediction of land use/land cover change and was validated. SAVI provides the most accurate estimate, i.e., the difference between predicted and actual data is minimal.

				<title>Tectonic imprints within a granite exposed near Srinagar, Rajasthan, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1361-1374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Partial melting in the middle to lower crustal level produces melts of granitic composition during orogeny. Thrusts play a vital role in their exhumation after consolidation of these granitic melts. In this paper we focus on one such granite along the eastern margin of the Delhi Fold Belt (DFB) rocks near Srinagar, Rajasthan, India. This is the first report of granite within the area and holds a key stratigraphic position in the entire rock package. The said granite is found to be intrusive to the DFB metasediments as well as their basement popularly known as the Banded Gneissic Complex (BGC). We disentangle the deformation fabrics seen within the granite and associated DFB metasediments, suggesting that subsequent to emplacement and consolidation, the granite has co-folded along with the country rocks. Three deformational events could be identified within the DFB metasediments namely, D<sub>1D</sub>, D<sub>2D</sub> and D<sub>3D</sub>. The peak metamorphism was achieved in the D<sub>1D</sub> event. The granite magma is generated and emplaced late syn-kinematic to D<sub>1D</sub> and thereafter is deformed by D<sub>2D</sub> and D<sub>3D</sub> producing D<sub>1G</sub> and D<sub>2G</sub> structural fabrics. These compressive deformations resulted in the collapse of the basin; the combined package of DFB rocks and the granite was thrusted eastwards over the basement rocks. The tectonic transport direction during thrusting is suggested eastwards from our structural analysis. Transverse faults developed perpendicular to the length of the granite have led to partitioning of the strain thereby showing a heterogeneity in the development of fabric within it.</p>

				<title>GPR studies over the tsunami affected Karaikal beach, Tamil Nadu, south India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1375-1385</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, results of GPR profiling related to mapping of subsurface sedimentary layers at tsunami affected Karaikal beach are presented. A 400 MHz antenna was used for profiling along 262 m stretch of transect from beach to backshore areas with penetration of about 2.0 m depth (50 ns two-way travel time). The velocity analysis was carried out to estimate the depth information along the GPR profile. Based on the significant changes in the reflection amplitude, three different zones are marked and the upper zone is noticed with less moisture compared to other two (saturated) zones. The water table is noticed to vary from 0.5 to 0.75 m depth (12–15 ns) as moving away from the coastline. Buried erosional surface is observed at 1.5 m depth (40–42 ns), which represents the limit up to which the extreme event acted upon. In other words, it is the depth to which the tsunami sediments have been piled up to about 1.5 m thickness. Three field test pits were made along the transect and sedimentary sequences were recorded. The sand layers, especially, heavy mineral layers, recorded in the test pits indicate a positive correlation with the amplitude and velocity changes in the GPR profile. Such interpretation seems to be difficult in the middle zone due to its water saturation condition. But it is fairly clear in the lower zone located just below the erosional surface where the strata is comparatively more compact. The inferences from the GPR profile thus provide a lucid insight to the subsurface sediment sequences of the tsunami sediments in the Karaikal beach.</p>

				<title>Chromian spinel-rich black sands from eastern shoreline of Andaman Island, India: Implication for source characteristics</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1387-1397</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Black sands rich in chromian spinel commonly occur in pockets along the eastern shoreline of Andaman Island where various types of peridotites and volcanics belonging to the Andaman ophiolite suite are exposed in close vicinity. The chemistry of these detrital chromian spinels has been extensively used here in identifying the source rocks <i>vis-à-vis</i> deciphering the source characteristics. The composition of the chromian spinels (Cr#: 0.20–0.88, Mg#: 0.26–0.77, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>: 5.04–48.21 wt.%, TiO<sub>2</sub>: up to 1.39 wt.% and Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup>: 1.73–9.12) varies widely signifying multiple sources, of which mantle peridotites and volcanic rocks are relevant in an ophiolitic terrain. The volcanic chromian spinels are relatively fresh, commonly euhedral, sometimes with compositional variations, and contain inclusions in contrast to the mantle peridotitic chromian spinels which are rounded, extensively fractured, and altered. We used a number of geochemical bivariate plots in order to know the provenance protoliths. The volcanic chromian spinels show geochemical characters of MORB, related to spreading centers (either MOR or back-arc) and also boninites/arc-tholeiites, related to active subduction. On the other hand, the peridotitic spinels indicate partially depleted lherzolite and depleted harzburgite source of the ophiolite suite.</p>

				<title>An appraisal of an iterative construction of the endmembers controlling the composition of deep-sea manganese nodules from the Central Indian Ocean Basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1399-1411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes an estimation of endmember compositions followed by the assessment of those results by log-ratio variance analysis. As an appraisal, it deals only with the first objective of an endmember analysis namely, to identify endmembers if they exist by estimating their compositions. Following the creation of the endmember estimates, the computation of an array of log-ratio variances was a key innovation in this type of study. Log-ratio variances revealed intrinsic linear associations between the dominant elements on each of the estimated endmember compositions, largely confirming the endmember analysis. The dataset under study contained the concentrations of 16 elements in 93 samples of deep-sea manganese nodules from the Central Indian Ocean Basin. Many previous analyses of these nodules were undertaken to assess the economic potential of the deposits. This study by contrast, quantified the interelement associations that account for the nodule compositions. Four endmembers were identified. The elements loaded on each were: (1) Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Mn-rich, (2) Fe, Ti, P, Co, Fe-rich, (3) Si, Al, Na, K, clay minerals, (3) Mg, ultramafic material, possibly including Mn, Cr, V, Ca, Na. These latter elements were also detected by their log-ratio variances to be associated with Mg on the 4th endmember.</p>

				<title>Ichnofabric analysis of the Tithonian shallow marine sediments (Bhadasar Formation) Jaisalmer Basin, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1413-1431</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The shallow marine sedimentary sequence of the Jaisalmer Basin exhibits one of the important and well-developed Tithonian sedimentary outcrops for western India. The ichnology and ichnofabric of the lower part of Bhadasar Formation (i.e., Kolar Dongar Member) belonging to Tithonian age are presented and discussed. The Kolar Dongar Member represents a shallow marine succession that contains 16 ichnotaxa: <i>Ancorichnus ancorichnus, Conichnus conicus, Gyrochorte comosa</i>, cf. <i>Jamesonichnites heinbergi, Imponoglyphus kevadiensis, Laevicyclus mongraensis, Monocraterion tentaculatum, Ophiomorpha nodosa, Palaeophycus tubularis, P. bolbiterminus, Phycodes palmatus, Planolites beverleyensis, Rhizocorallium</i> isp., <i>Rosselia rotatus, R. socialis</i>, and <i>Teichichnus rectus</i>. The ichnofabric analysis divulges five distinct ichnofabrics, each typifying distinct depositional environment within shallow marine conditions. The ichnofabric <i>Ophiomorpha</i> 1 with syn-sedimentary faulting exemplifies high energy conditions typical of lower shoreface environment, whereas the <i>Ophiomorpha</i> 2 ichnofabric typifies upper shoreface environment. The <i>Ancorichnus</i> ichnofabric reflects lower offshore condition of deposition. The high ichnodiversity <i>Ancorichnus–Rosselia</i> ichnofabric is indicative of inner shelf conditions, while low ichno-diversity <i>Teichichnus</i> ichnofabric indicates prevalence of low energy brackish bay environment. Thus, Tithonian Kolar Dongar Member indicates depositional environment ranging from shoreface to offshore to inner shelf and finally to brackish bay environment.</p>

				<title>The chemical composition of tertiary Indian coal ash and its combustion behaviour – a statistical approach: Part 2</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1439-1449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In Part 1 of the present investigation, 37 representative Eocene coal samples of Meghalaya, India were analyzed and their physico-chemical characteristics and the major oxides and minerals present in ash samples were studied for assessing the genesis of these coals. Various statistical tools were also applied to study their genesis. The datasets from Part 1 used in this investigation (Part 2) show the contribution of major oxides towards ash fusion temperatures (AFTs). The regression analysis of high temperature ash (HTA) composition and initial deformation temperature (IDT) show a definite increasing or decreasing trend, which has been used to determine the predictive indices for slagging, fouling, and abrasion propensities during combustion practices. The increase or decrease of IDT is influenced by the increase of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and CaO, respectively. Detrital-authigenic index (DAI) calculated from the ash composition and its relation with AFT indicates Sialoferric nature of these coals. The correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were used to study the possible fouling, slagging, and abrasion potentials in boilers during the coal combustion processes. A positive relationship between slagging and heating values of the coal has been found in this study.</p>

				<title>Radiation and energy balance dynamics over young chir pine (<i>Pinus roxburghii</i>) system in Doon of western Himalayas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1451-1465</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The regional impacts of future climate changes are principally driven by changes in energy fluxes. In this study, measurements on micrometeorological and biophysical variables along with surface energy exchange were made over a coniferous subtropical chir pine (<i>Pinus roxburghii</i>) plantation ecosystem at Forest Research Institute, Doon valley, India. The energy balance components were analyzed for two years to understand the variability of surface energy fluxes, their drivers, and closure pattern. The period covered two growth cycles of pine in the years 2010 and 2011 without and with understory growth. Net short wave and long wave radiative fluxes substantially varied with cloud dynamics, season, rainfall induced surface wetness, and green growth. The study clearly brought out the intimate link of albedo dynamics in chir pine system with dynamics of leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture, and changes in understory background. Rainfall was found to have tight linear coupling with latent heat fluxes. Latent heat flux during monsoon period was found to be higher in higher rainfall year (2010) than in lower rainfall year (2011). Higher or lower pre-monsoon sensible heat fluxes were succeeded by noticeably higher or lower monsoon rainfall respectively. Proportion of latent heat flux to net radiation typically followed the growth curve of green vegetation fraction, but with time lag. The analysis of energy balance closure (EBC) showed that the residual energy varied largely within ±30% of net available energy and the non-closure periods were marked by higher rainspells or forced clearance of understory growths.</p>

				<title>Analysing land and vegetation cover dynamics during last three decades in Katerniaghat wildlife sanctuary, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1467-1479</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The change in the tropical forests could be clearly linked to the expansion of the human population and economies. An understanding of the anthropogenic forcing plays an important role in analyzing the impacts of climate change and the fate of tropical forests in the present and future scenario. In the present study, we analyze the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors in forest dynamics in Katerniaghat wildlife sanctuary situated along the Indo-Nepal border in Uttar Pradesh state, India. The study site is under tremendous pressure due to anthropogenic factors from surrounding areas since last three decades. The vegetation cover of the sanctuary primarily comprised of <i>Shorea robusta</i> forests, <i>Tectona grandis</i> plantation, and mixed deciduous forest; while the land cover comprised of agriculture, barren land, and water bodies. The classification accuracy was 83.5%, 91.5%, and 95.2% with MSS, IKONOS, and Quickbird datasets, respectively. <i>Shorea robusta</i> forests showed an increase of 16 km<sup>2</sup>; while <i>Tectona grandis</i> increased by 63.01 km<sup>2</sup> during 1975–2010. The spatial heterogeneity in these tropical vegetation classes surrounded by the human dominated agricultural lands could not be addressed using Landsat MSS data due to coarse spatial resolution; whereas the IKONOS and Quickbird satellite datasets proved to advantageous, thus being able to precisely address the variations within the vegetation classes as well as in the land cover classes and along the edge areas. Massive deforestation during 1970s along the adjoining international boundary with Nepal has led to destruction of the wildlife corridor and has exposed the wildlife sanctuary to interference like grazing and poaching. Higher rates of forest dynamics during the 25-year period indicate the vulnerability of the ecosystem to the natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the proximity of the sanctuary.</p>

The invasive weed infestation has been identified using multi-temporal remote sensing datasets of 1977, 1990, 1999, 2005 and 2011. Spatial analyses of the transition matrix, extent of invasive colonies, patchiness, coalescence and rate of spread were carried out. During the study period of three and half decades, almost 295 km<sup>2</sup> of the natural land cover was converted into <i>Prosopis</i> cover. This study has shown an increment of 42.9% of area under <i>Prosopis</i> cover in the Great Rann of Kachchh, part of the Kachchh Biosphere Reserve during 1977 to 2011. Spatial analysis indicates high occupancy of <i>Prosopis</i> cover with most of the invasion (95.9%) occurring in the grasslands and only 4.1% in other land cover types. The process of <i>Prosopis</i> invasion shows high patch initiation, followed by coalescence, indicating aggressive colonization of species. The number of patches within an area of &gt; 1 km<sup>2</sup> increased from 1977 to 2011, indicating the formation of new <i>Prosopis</i> habitats by replacing the grasslands. The largest patch of <i>Prosopis</i> cover increased from 144 km<sup>2</sup> in 1977 to 430 km<sup>2</sup> in 2011. The estimated mean patch size was 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> in 1977. The mean patch size was largest during 2011, i.e., 9 km<sup>2</sup>. The annual spread rate for <i>Prosopis</i> has been estimated as 2.1% during 2005–2011. The present work has investigated the long term changes in <i>Prosopis</i> cover in the Great Rann of Kachchh, part of Kachchh Biosphere Reserve. The spatial database generated will be useful in preparing strategies for the management of <i>Prosopis juliflora</i>.</p>

				<title>Analysis of the microclimate and CO<sub>2</sub> flux characteristics in arid desert wetland ecosystem in summer: A case study in Xihu desert wetland, Dunhuang, China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1491-1499</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Xihu desert wetland is an important and unusual environment in China or even in the world. However, until now, little research has been focused on the microclimate and CO<sub>2</sub> flux characteristics in this area. This paper reports the characteristics of daily variations of microclimate and CO<sub>2</sub> flux in the Dunhuang Xihu desert wetland, based on data observed in the desert wetland during a period of continuous fine weather in summer 2012. Results indicate that the characteristics of the micrometeorology were significantly affected by the land–lake breeze during the study period, and updrafts were prevalent in this region. The friction wind speed and the vertical velocity were much greater than those in the Maqu grasslands. The energy budget was strongly imbalanced: the latent heat flux was significantly higher than the sensible flux. The daily mean values of total solar radiation and net radiation were larger than those in Maqu grasslands and Jinta oasis. There was a temperature inversion and inverse humidity gradient in the atmospheric surface layer at night. The desert wetland ecosystem was a carbon sink during the whole of the observation period, and the maximum rate of carbon absorption usually occurred at about 11:00 hr each day in this region.</p>

				<title>Morphometric analysis of Suketi river basin, Himachal Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1501-1515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Suketi river basin is located in the Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh, India. It encompasses a central inter-montane valley and surrounding mountainous terrain in the Lower Himachal Himalaya. Morphometric analysis of the Suketi river basin was carried out to study its drainage characteristics and overall groundwater resource potential. The entire Suketi river basin has been divided into five sub-basins based on the catchment areas of Suketi trunk stream and its major tributaries. Quantitative assessment of each sub-basin was carried out for its linear, areal, and relief aspects. The analysis reveals that the drainage network of the entire Suketi river basin constitutes a 7th order basin. Out of five sub-basins, Kansa khad sub-basin (KKSB), Gangli khad sub-basin (GKSB) and Ratti khad sub-basin (RKSB) are 5th order subbasins. The Dadour khad sub-basin (DKSB) is 6th order sub-basin, while Suketi trunk stream sub-basin (STSSB) is a 7th order sub-basin. The entire drainage basin area reflects late youth to early mature stage of development of the fluvial geomorphic cycle, which is dominated by rain and snow fed lower order streams. It has low stream frequency (Fs) and moderate drainage density (Dd) of 2.69 km/km<sup>2</sup>. Bifurcation ratios (Rb) of various stream orders indicate that streams up to 3rd order are surging through highly dissected mountainous terrain, which facilitates high overland flow and less recharge into the subsurface resulting in low groundwater potential in the zones of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order streams of the Suketi river basin. The circulatory ratio (Rc) of 0.65 and elongation ratio (Re) of 0.80 show elongated nature of the Suketi river basin, while infiltration number (If) of 10.66 indicates dominance of relief features and low groundwater potential in the high altitude mountainous terrain. The asymmetry factor (Af) of Suketi river basin indicates that the palaeo-tectonic tilting, at drainage basin scale, was towards the downstream right side of the drainage basin. The slope map of Suketi river basin has been classified into three main zones, which delineate the runoff zone in the mountains, recharge zone in the transition zone between mountains and valley plane, and discharge zone in the plane areas of Balh valley.</p>

				<title>Spatial distribution of soil erosion and suspended sediment transport rate for Chou-Shui river basin</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1517-1539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, a Physiographic Soil Erosion–Deposition Model (PSED) is applied for better management of a watershed. The PSED model can effectively evaluate the key parameters of watershed management: surface runoff discharge, suspended sediment transport rate, quantity of soil erosion, and spatial distribution of soil erosion and deposition. A basin usually contains multiple watersheds. These watersheds may have complex topography and heterogeneous physiographic properties. The PSED model, containing a physiographic rainfall-runoff model and a basin scale erosion–deposition model, can simulate the physical mechanism of the entire erosion process based on a detailed calculation of bed-load transportation, surface soil entrainment, and the deposition mechanism. With the assistance of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the PSED model can handle and analyze extremely large hydrologic and physiographic datasets and simulate the physical erosion process without the need for simplification. We verified the PSED model using three typhoon events and 40 rainfall events. The application of PSED to Chou-Shui River basin shows that the PSED model can accurately estimate discharge hydrographs, suspended sediment transport rates, and sediment yield. Additionally, we obtained reasonable quantities of soil erosion as well as the spatial distribution of soil erosion and deposition. The results show that the PSED model is capable of calculating spatially distributed soil erosion and suspended sediment transport rates for a basin with multiple watersheds even if these watersheds have complex topography and heterogeneous physiographic properties.</p>

				<title>Impact of over-exploitation on groundwater quality: A case study from WR-2Watershed, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1541-1566</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The WR-2 watershed is located in the Deccan trap basaltic terrain of Maharashtra State, India. The watershed area incorporates a rich orange orchard belt that requires a huge quantity of water for irrigation. This requirement is mostly met through groundwater, extracted from the shallow aquifers of the WR-2 watershed. However, over the years, excess withdrawal of groundwater from these aquifers has resulted in depletion of groundwater level. The declining trends of groundwater level, both long term and short term, have had a negative impact on the groundwater quality of the study area. This effect can be gauged through the rising electrical conductivity (EC) of groundwater in the shallow aquifers (dug wells) of the WR-2 watershed. It is observed that the long term declining trend of groundwater level, during 1977–2010, varied from 0.03 to 0.04 m per year, whereas the corresponding trend of rising EC varied from 1.90 to 2.94 𝜇S/cm per year. During 2007–2010, about 56% dug wells showed a positive correlation between depleting groundwater level and rising EC values. The groundwater level depletion during this period ranged from 0.03 to 0.67 m per year, whereas the corresponding trend of rising EC ranged from 0.52 to 46.91 𝜇S/cm per year. Moreover, the water quality studies reveal that groundwater from more than 50% of the dug wells of the WR-2 watershed is not suitable for drinking purpose. The groundwater, though mostly suitable for irrigation purpose, is corrosive and saturated with respect to mineral equilibrium and shows a tendency towards chemical scale formation.</p>

				<title>Hydrologic factors controlling groundwater salinity in northwestern coastal zone, Egypt</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1567-1578</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aim of this article is to assess the main factors influencing salinity of groundwater in the coastal area between El Dabaa and Sidi Barani, Egypt. The types and ages of the main aquifers in this area are the fractured limestone of Middle Miocene, the calcareous sandstone of Pliocene and the Oolitic Limestone of Pleistocene age. The aquifers in the area are recharged by seasonal rainfall of the order of 150 mm/year. The relationship of groundwater salinity against the absolute water level, the well drilling depth, and the ability of aquifer to recharge has been discussed in the present work. The ability of aquifer to locally recharge by direct rainfall is a measure of the vertical permeability due to lithological and structural factors that control groundwater salinity in the investigated aquifers. On the other hand, the fracturing system as well as the attitude of the surface water divide has a prime role in changing both the mode of occurrence and the salinity of groundwater in the area. Directly to the west of Matrouh, where the coastal plain is the narrowest, and east of Barrani, where the coastal plain is the widest, are good examples of this concept, where the water salinity attains its maximum and minimum limits respectively. Accordingly, well drilling in the Miocene aquifer, in the area between El Negila and Barrani to get groundwater of salinities less than 5000 mg/l is recommended in this area, at flow rate less than 10m<sup>3</sup>/hr/well. In other words, one can expect that the brackish water is probably found where the surface water divide is far from the shore line, where the Wadi fill deposits dominate (Quaternary aquifer), acting as a possible water salinity by direct rainfall and runoff.</p>

				<title>Comparison of surrogate models with different methods in groundwater remediation process</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1579-1589</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Surrogate modelling is an effective tool for reducing computational burden of simulation optimization. In this article, polynomial regression (PR), radial basis function artificial neural network (RBFANN), and kriging methods were compared for building surrogate models of a multiphase flow simulation model in a simplified nitrobenzene contaminated aquifer remediation problem. In the model accuracy analysis process, a 10-fold cross validation method was adopted to evaluate the approximation accuracy of the three surrogate models. The results demonstrated that: RBFANN surrogate model and kriging surrogate model had acceptable approximation accuracy, and further that kriging model’s approximation accuracy was slightly higher than RBFANN model. However, the PR model demonstrated unacceptably poor approximation accuracy. Therefore, the RBFANN and kriging surrogates were selected and used in the optimization process to identify the most cost-effective remediation strategy at a nitrobenzene-contaminated site. The optimal remediation costs obtained with the two surrogate-based optimization models were similar, and had similar computational burden. These two surrogate-based optimization models are efficient tools for optimal groundwater remediation strategy identification.</p>

				<title>Artificial neural network coupled with wavelet transform for estimating snow water equivalent using passive microwave data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1591-1601</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is an important parameter in hydrologic engineering involving the stream-flow forecasting of high-elevation watersheds. In this paper, the application of classic Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) and a hybrid model combining the wavelet and ANN (WANN) is investigated in estimating the value of SWE in a mountainous basin. In addition, k-fold cross validation method is used in order to achieve a more reliable and robust model. In this regard, microwave images acquired from Spectral Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) are used to estimate the SWE of Tehran sub-basins during 1992–2008 period. Also for obtaining measured SWE within the corresponding Equal-Area Scalable Earth-Grid (EASE-Grid) cell of SSM/I image, approach of Cell-SWE extraction using height–SWE relations is applied in order to reach more precise estimations. The obtained results reveal that the wavelet-ANN model significantly increases the accuracy of estimations, mainly because of using multi-scale time series as the ANN inputs. The Nash–Sutcliffe Index (NSE) for ANN and WANN models is respectively 0.09 and 0.44 which shows a firm improvement of 0.35 in NSE parameter when WANN is applied. Similar trend is observed in other parameters including RMSE where the value is 0.3 for ANN and 0.07 for WANN.</p>

				<title>Assessment of climate change impacts on rainfall using large scale climate variables and downscaling models – A case study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1603-1618</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many of the applied techniques in water resources management can be directly or indirectly influenced by hydro-climatology predictions. In recent decades, utilizing the large scale climate variables as predictors of hydrological phenomena and downscaling numerical weather ensemble forecasts has revolutionized the long-lead predictions. In this study, two types of rainfall prediction models are developed to predict the rainfall of the Zayandehrood dam basin located in the central part of Iran. The first seasonal model is based on large scale climate signals data around the world. In order to determine the inputs of the seasonal rainfall prediction model, the correlation coefficient analysis and the new Gamma Test (GT) method are utilized. Comparison of modelling results shows that the Gamma test method improves the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of modelling performance as 8% and 10% for dry and wet seasons, respectively. In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting rainfall in the region has been used and its results are compared with the benchmark models such as K-nearest neighbours (KNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results show better performance of the SVM model at testing stage. In the second model, statistical downscaling model (SDSM) as a popular downscaling tool has been used. In this model, using the outputs from GCM, the rainfall of Zayandehrood dam is projected under two climate change scenarios. Most effective variables have been identified among 26 predictor variables. Comparison of the results of the two models shows that the developed SVM model has lesser errors in monthly rainfall estimation. The results show that the rainfall in the future wet periods are more than historical values and it is lower than historical values in the dry periods. The highest monthly uncertainty of future rainfall occurs in March and the lowest in July.</p>

				<title>Growth of cyclone Viyaru and Phailin – a comparative study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1619-1635</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tropical cyclone Viyaru maintained a unique quasi-uniform intensity during its life span. Despite being in contact with sea surface for &lt; 120 hr travelling about 2150 km, the cyclonic storm (CS) intensity, once attained, did not intensify further, hitherto not exhibited by any other system over the Bay of Bengal. On the contrary, the cyclone Phailin over the Bay of Bengal intensified into very severe cyclonic storm (VSCS) within about 48 hr from its formation as depression. The system also experienced rapid intensification phase (intensity increased by 30 kts or more during subsequent 24 hours) during its life time and maximum intensity reached up to 115 kts. In this paper, a comparative study is carried out to explore the evolution of the various thermodynamical parameters and possible reasons for such converse features of the two cyclones. Analysis of thermodynamical parameters shows that the development of the lower tropospheric and upper tropospheric potential vorticity (PV) was low and quasi-static during the lifecycle of the cyclone Viyaru. For the cyclone Phailin, there was continuous development of the lower tropospheric and upper tropospheric PV, which attained a very high value during its lifecycle. Also there was poor and fluctuating diabatic heating in the middle and upper troposphere and cooling in the lower troposphere for Viyaru. On the contrary, the diabatic heating was positive from lower to upper troposphere with continuous development and increase up to 6&#176;C in the upper troposphere. The analyses of cross sections of diabatic heating, PV, and the 1000–500 hPa geopotential metre (gpm) thickness contours indicate that the cyclone Viyaru was vertically tilted (westward) and lacked axisymmetry in its structure and converse features (axisymmetric and vertical) that occurred for the cyclone Phailin. In addition, there was a penetration of dry air in the middle troposphere of Viyaru, whereas high moisture existed in the middle troposphere of Phailin. The vertical wind shear (5–10 $ms^{−1}$) near the core of the storm region between 850 and 200 hPa was favourable for both the systems but was higher in the northern region of the cyclone Viyaru. The divergent development of these thermodynamic features conspired to produce converse characteristic of the two cyclones.</p>

				<title>Forecasting of cyclone Viyaru and Phailin by NWP-based cyclone prediction system (CPS) of IMD – an evaluation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1637-1652</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An objective NWP-based cyclone prediction system (CPS) was implemented for the operational cyclone forecasting work over the Indian seas. The method comprises of five forecast components, namely (a) Cyclone Genesis Potential Parameter (GPP), (b) Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) technique for cyclone track prediction, (c) cyclone intensity prediction, (d) rapid intensification, and (e) predicting decaying intensity after the landfall. GPP is derived based on dynamical and thermodynamical parameters from the model output of IMD operational Global Forecast System. The MME technique for the cyclone track prediction is based on multiple linear regression technique. The predictor selected for the MME are forecast latitude and longitude positions of cyclone at 12-hr intervals up to 120 hours forecasts from five NWP models namely, IMD-GFS, IMD-WRF, NCEP-GFS, UKMO, and JMA. A statistical cyclone intensity prediction (SCIP) model for predicting 12 hourly cyclone intensity (up to 72 hours) is developed applying multiple linear regression technique. Various dynamical and thermodynamical parameters as predictors are derived from the model outputs of IMD operational Global Forecast System and these parameters are also used for the prediction of rapid intensification. For forecast of inland wind after the landfall of a cyclone, an empirical technique is developed. This paper briefly describes the forecast system CPS and evaluates the performance skill for two recent cyclones Viyaru (non-intensifying) and Phailin (rapid intensifying), converse in nature in terms of track and intensity formed over Bay of Bengal in 2013. The evaluation of performance shows that the GPP analysis at early stages of development of a low pressure system indicated the potential of the system for further intensification. The 12-hourly track forecast by MME, intensity forecast by SCIP model, and rapid intensification forecasts are found to be consistent and very useful to the operational forecasters. The error statistics of the decay model shows that the model was able to predict the decaying intensity after landfall with reasonable accuracy. The performance statistics demonstrates the potential of the system for improving operational cyclone forecast service over the Indian seas.</p>

				<title>Effect of some climatic parameters on tropospheric and total ozone column over Alipore (22.52&#176;N, 88.33&#176;E), India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1653-1669</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper presents the nature of variations of tropospheric and total ozone column retrieved from the Convective Cloud Differential (CCD) technique, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data, National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA), USA, respectively; surface temperature, relative humidity, total rainfall, ozone precursors (non-methane hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide) that are collected from India Meteorological Department (IMD), Alipore, Kolkata; solar insolation obtained from Solar Geophysical Data Book and El-ñ index collected from National Climatic Data Center, US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA. The effect of these climatic parameters and ozone precursors on ozone variations is critically analyzed and explained on the basis of linear regression and correlation. It has been observed that the maximum, minimum and mean temperature, relative humidity, solar insolation, tropospheric, and total ozone column (TOC) showed slight increasing tendencies from October 2004 to December 2011, while total rainfall and El-ñ index showed little decreasing tendencies for the same period. Amongst selected climatic parameters and ozone precursors, the solar insolation and the average temperature had a significant influence on both, the tropospheric ozone and total ozone column formation. The solar insolation had contributed more in tropospheric ozone than in total ozone column; while El-ñ index had played a more significant role in total ozone column build up than in tropospheric ozone. Negative correlation was observed between almost all ozone precursors with the tropospheric and total ozone. The tropospheric ozone and total ozone column were also significantly correlated. The level of significance and contribution of different climatic parameters are determined from correlation technique and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method. The related chemical kinetics for ozone production processes has been critically described.</p>

				<title>Species diversity variations in Neogene deep-sea benthic foraminifera at ODP Hole 730A, western Arabian Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1671-1680</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Deep-sea benthic foraminifera are an important and widely used marine proxy to understand paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic changes on regional and global scales, owing to their sensitivity to oceanic and climatic turnovers. Some species of benthic foraminifera are sensitive to changes in water mass properties whereas others are sensitive to organic fluxes and deep-sea oxygenation. Benthic faunal diversity has been found closely linked to food web, bottom water oxygen levels, and substrate and water mass stability. The present study is aimed at analyzing species diversity trends in benthic foraminifera and their linkages with Indian monsoon variability during the Neogene. Species diversity of benthic foraminifera is examined in terms of number of species (S), information function (H), equitability (E) and Sanders’ rarefied values, which were combined with relative abundances of high and low productivity benthic foraminifera at Ocean Drilling Program Hole 730A, Oman margin, western Arabian Sea. The Oman margin offers the best opportunity to understand monsoon-driven changes in benthic diversity since summer monsoon winds have greater impact on the study area. The species diversity was higher during the early Miocene Climatic Optimum (∼17.2–16.4 Ma) followed by a decrease during 16.4–13 Ma coinciding with a major increase in Antarctic ice volume and increased formation of Antarctic Bottom Water. All the diversity parameters show an increase during 13–11.6 Ma, a gradual decrease during 11.6–9 Ma and then an increase with a maximum at 7 Ma. Thereafter the values show little change until 1.2 Ma when all the parameters abruptly decrease. The benthic foraminiferal populations and diversity at Hole 730A were mainly driven by the Indian monsoon, and polar waters might have played a minor or no role since early Neogene period as the Arabian Sea is an enclosed basin.</p>

				<title>Upper Cisuralian palynology and palaeoclimate of Manuguru area Godavari basin, and their global correlation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1681-1692</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Permian system of the Palaeozoic Erathem is divided into three series, the Early Permian Cisuralian Series, the Middle Permian Guadalupian Series, and the Late Permian Lopingian Series. The Cisuralian Series encompasses the Asselian to Kungurian stages which constitute the basal part of the Gondwana supersequence I. In India, they are represented lithostratigraphically by the Talchir, Karharbari, and Barakar formations. This paper presents the palynological results from the Barakar Formation of the Upper Cisuralian Series from Manuguru which lies in the southeastern part of the Godavari basin. The succession studied comprises 35 subsurface samples from bore hole 1007 represented by clay, shale, sandstone, and coal. The palynofloras in this sequence have a homogenous composition demonstrating that not many significant floral changes took place through the considered stratigraphic range. The entire sequence is characterized by the dominance of nonstriate bisaccate genus <i>Scheuringipollenites</i> and subdominance of striate bisaccate genus <i>Faunipollenites (=Protohaploxypinus)</i>. The other pollen genera among the nonstriate bisaccates are <i>Rhizomaspora, Primuspollenites, Ibisporites</i>, and <i>Platysaccus</i>. The striate bisaccates include <i>Striatites, Striatopodocarpites</i>, and <i>Stroterosporites</i>. The taeniate taxa are represented by <i>Lueckisporites</i> and <i>Lunatisporites</i>. The common monosaccate genera include <i>Caheniasaccites, Potoniesporites</i>, and <i>Barakarites</i>. Spores are less common and include <i>Latosporites, Brevitriletes, Horriditriletes, Microbaculispora</i>, and <i>Callumispora</i>. They characterize the palynofloral composition of the Lower Barakar Formation. The correlation of this assemblage with some of the biostratigraphic palynozones proposed previously for the Cisuralian sequences of the Paraná Basin of South America, Kalahari Karoo Basin of South Africa, Ruhuhu Basin of Tanzania, East Africa as well as palynoassemblages from South Victoria Land and Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica and Collie Basin of west Australia point out to their Early Permian (Late Sakmarian–Early Artinskian) age. Palynomorphs such as <i>Botryococcus</i> sp., <i>Tetraporinia</i> sp., <i>Balmeela</i> sp. and <i>Leiosphaeridia</i> sp. are also recorded which suggest that these sediments were deposited during post-glacial near shore, cool and humid environment.</p>

				<title>‘Indicator’ carbonaceous phyllite/graphitic schist in the Archean Kundarkocha gold deposit, Singhbhum orogenic belt, eastern India: Implications for gold mineralization <i>vis-a-vis</i> organic matter</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1693-1703</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Carbonaceous rocks in the form of graphitic schist and carbonaceous phyllite are the major host rocks of the gold mineralization in Kundarkocha gold deposit of the Precambrian Singhbhum orogenic belt in eastern India. The detection of organic carbon, essentially in the carbonaceous phyllite and graphitized schist within the Precambrian terrain, is noted from this deposit. A very close relationship exists between gold mineralization and ubiquitous carbonaceous rocks containing organic carbon that seems to play a vital role in the deposition of gold in a Precambrian terrain in India and important metallogenetic implications for such type of deposits elsewhere. However, the role played by organic matter in a Precambrian gold deposit is debatable and the mechanism of precipitation of gold and other metals by organic carbon has been reported elsewhere. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results and total organic carbon (TOC) values suggest that at least part of the organic material acted as a possible source for the reduction that played a significant role in the precipitation of gold. Lithological, electron probe analysis (EPMA), fluid inclusions associated with gold mineralization, Total Carbon (TC), TOC and FTIR results suggest that the gold mineralization is spatially and genetically associated with graphitic schist, carbonaceous phyllite/shale that are constituted of immature organic carbon or kerogen. Nano-scale gold inclusions along with free milling gold are associated with sulfide mineral phases present within the carbonaceous host rocks as well as in mineralized quartz-carbonate veins. Deposition of gold could have been facilitated due to the organic redox reactions and the graphitic schist and carbonaceous phyllite zone may be considered as the indicator zone.</p>

					<p>In the present investigation, 37 numbers of high sulphur tertiary coal samples from Meghalaya, India have been studied on the basis of proximate and ash analysis. Various statistical tools like Bivariant Analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA), and also the geochemical indicators were applied to determine the dominant detrital or authigenic affinity of the ash forming elements in these coals. The genetic interpretation of coal as well as the coal ash has been carried out based on chemical compositions of high temperature ash (HTA) by using Detrital/Authigenic Index. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was also carried out to study the mineralogy of the studied coal ashes. Both statistical tools and geochemical indicators have confirmed the detrital nature of these coals as well as the ash forming elements.</p>

				<title>Palaeoweathering characteristics of an intrabasaltic red bole of the Deccan Flood Basalts near Shrivardhan of western coast of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1717-1728</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An intrabasaltic red bole horizon is studied for its weathering characteristics with respect to the underlying and overlying basalts. The study indicates that all the three units have been considerably weathered; the red bole unit, however shows some distinctive characteristics. The red boles show a higher cation exchange capacity (CEC) and lower sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and organic carbon (OC) as compared to the weathered basalts. The lower values of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(T) in red boles indicate their lesser weathering than the underlying and overlying basalts, which is further corroborated by the weathering intensity measured by the indices like chemical index of alteration (CIA) and statistical empirical index of chemical weathering (W). It is also evident that the red bole samples show more retention of original mafic and felsic components. While K<sub>2</sub>O exhibits an erratic behaviour, the MgO and CaO do not show much leaching in red boles. Lesser leaching and salinity in the red boles is indicated by the higher values of calcification and lower values of salinization. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> plot indicates that red bole samples are close to the basalt field, while the weathered upper basalt is more kaolinized than the weathered lower basalt. These observations reveal that the post-formational weathering processes have least affected the original palaeoweathering characters of the red bole horizon and hence the intrabasaltic palaeosols (weathering horizons) can effectively be used to constrain the palaeoweathering and palaeoclimates during the continental flood basalt episodes in the geologic past.</p>

				<title>An integral-free expression for short-term changes in fault stability due to pore pressure induced when a point load is placed on the pervious boundary of a porous elastic half space containing a fault</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1729-1738</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A concentrated load with step-function time behaviour is placed normal to the planar, pervious boundary of a porous elastic half space (PEHS) with compressible constituents. A planar fault exists in the PEHS in such a way that the poroelastic behaviour of the medium is unhindered. We derive an approximate but integral-free expression for CFSCPP, i.e., changes in fault stability due to changes in pore pressure, at a point not too far off the line along which the load acts. But, in the interest of simplicity, the main discussion is focussed on a consideration of CFSCPP at a point 𝑃 located on the fault at depth 𝑧 directly beneath the load. It is convenient to introduce dimensionless time $t_D$ directly proportional to real time 𝑡. The constant of proportionality is 4c/z<sup>2</sup>, where 𝑐 is hydraulic diffusivity. The derived approximate expression gives results with an accuracy of greater than 99% for limited values of $t_D$ after the load is imposed. We learn from the derived expression that, for a given 𝑧, fault stability undergoes an initial sudden decrease commensurate with the undrained pore pressure induced in the PEHS. This is followed by a more gradual decrease in fault stability with increasing $t_D$ until a minimum is reached. The real time 𝑡 to minimum fault stability increases with 𝑧. The magnitude of CFSCPP decreases with 𝑧 as $z^{−2}$ for a given $t_D$ in the permissible range. The derived expression and the inferences based on it should be useful during earth science investigations of the possible hazards due to reactivation of a pre-existing shallow fault when a civil engineering project involving imposition of a heavy load on the earth’s surface is to be executed nearby. They should be useful also for investigations if a shallow earthquake occurs near such a project soon after its execution.</p>

				<title>Impact of global warming on the energetics of lower tropospheric ultra-long waves and the Indian summer monsoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1739-1747</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Analyses of 60 years (1949–2008) of monthly energetics of the zonal waves derived from NCEP/NCAR data indicate that ultra-long waves (waves 1 and 2) dominate the spectrum of lower tropospheric zonal waves during monsoon season (June–September). Westerlies over the Indian subcontinent are a source of energy to wave 1. Two oceanic anticyclones, one over Pacific and the other over Atlantic are sources of energy to wave 2. These two waves are inversely correlated. Climatology of the energetics of ultralong waves for the two epochs 1949–1978 (CLP1) and 1979–2008 (CLP2) of 30 years indicates that the intensity of wave 1 has decreased by about 33% whereas the intensity of wave 2 has increased by about 27%. Northward transport of sensible heat during CLP1 changes to southward during CLP2. Larger generation of zonal mean Available Potential Energy (APE) during CLP2 indicates more heating. A larger conversion of kinetic energy (KE) of wave 1 into APE of wave 1 leads to weakening of wave 1 during CLP2. In case of wave 2, lower rate of conversion of KE to APE leads to stronger wave 2 during CLP2. slagging and heating values of the coal has been found in this study.</p>

				<title>A modified sliding spectral method and its application to COSMIC radio occultation data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1749-1758</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the moist lower troposphere, a limitation of the sliding spectral (SS) method is the restriction of the resolution of bending angle profiles because of the atmospheric multipath effect and noise. A modified sliding spectral (MSS) method is proposed in this paper to improve the inversion resolution of SS method in the moist lower troposphere. Simulation results show that the noise in the signal may cause inversion error in the classical SS method. The MSS method can decrease the influence of the noise to some extent. The SS and MSS methods were used to process COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) atmPhs profiles from DOY (day of year) 71–DOY 100 in 2007. The retrieved refractivity profiles were compared with those from the corresponding ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) analysis. The results show that the SS method contains systematic positive biases in the 3–10 km height range and systematic negative biases below 3 km. The MSS method, in comparison to SS method, has decreased the maximum positive bias in the range of 3–10 km height from 0.37% to 0.23% in the northern hemisphere, from 1.3% to 0.25% in the tropics, and from 0.60% to 0.35% in the southern hemisphere. The biases of the MSS method are comparable to those announced for the COSMIC atmPrf profile; the latter is inverted by full spectrum inversion (FSI) method.</p>

				<title>GPU-based normalized cuts for road extraction using satellite imagery</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1759-1769</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a GPU implementation of normalized cuts for road extraction problem using panchromatic satellite imagery. The roads have been extracted in three stages namely pre-processing, image segmentation and post-processing. Initially, the image is pre-processed to improve the tolerance by reducing the clutter (that mostly represents the buildings, vegetation, and fallow regions). The road regions are then extracted using the normalized cuts algorithm. Normalized cuts algorithm is a graph-based partitioning approach whose focus lies in extracting the global impression (perceptual grouping) of an image rather than local features. For the segmented image, post-processing is carried out using morphological operations – erosion and dilation. Finally, the road extracted image is overlaid on the original image. Here, a GPGPU (General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit) approach has been adopted to implement the same algorithm on the GPU for fast processing. A performance comparison of this proposed GPU implementation of normalized cuts algorithm with the earlier algorithm (CPU implementation) is presented. From the results, we conclude that the computational improvement in terms of time as the size of image increases for the proposed GPU implementation of normalized cuts. Also, a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the segmentation results has been projected.</p>

				<title>A Hidden Markov Model for avalanche forecasting on Chowkibal–Tangdhar road axis in Indian Himalayas</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1771-1779</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A numerical avalanche prediction scheme using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been developed for Chowkibal–Tangdhar road axis in J&amp;K, India. The model forecast is in the form of different levels of avalanche danger (no, low, medium, and high) with a lead time of two days. Snow and meteorological data (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, fresh snow, fresh snow duration, standing snow) of past 12 winters (1992–2008) have been used to derive the model input variables (average temperature, fresh snow in 24 hrs, snow fall intensity, standing snow, Snow Temperature Index (STI) of the top layer, and STI of buried layer). As in HMMs, there are two sequences: a state sequence and a state dependent observation sequence; in the present model, different levels of avalanche danger are considered as different states of the model and Avalanche Activity Index (AAI) of a day, derived from the model input variables, as an observation. Validation of the model with independent data of two winters (2008–2009, 2009–2010) gives 80% accuracy for both day-1 and day-2. Comparison of various forecasting quality measures and Heidke Skill Score of the HMM and the NN model indicate better forecasting skill of the HMM.</p>

				<title>Hydrological feasibility of gravity diversion of the west flowing Nethravathi in Karnataka</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1781-1792</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The concept of collecting surface runoff on the slopes in canals cut across the western slopes of the Western Ghats, in order to divert part of a flow in the west flowing rivers to the east by gravity, is being promoted in Karnataka. This paper presents a study of the hydrological feasibility of such canals, termed ‘garland canals’ and claimed to be an environmental friendly alternative to the conventional technologies for inter-basin transfer of water, by their promoters. The paper presents a methodology for disaggregating normal annual rainfall into 15-min magnitudes and its application for simulating surface runoff, using a knowledge of infiltration rates on the slopes. The study has been carried out considering a part of a garland canal proposed for diverting the river Netravathi in the state. The results from the study reveal that significant amounts of flow can be collected in the proposed canal only if streams are also tapped and that because of the arrangements necessary for the purpose, garland canals cannot be considered a means superior to the conventional methods for diverting west flowing rivers.</p>

				<title>Estimation of soil moisture and its effect on soil thermal characteristics at Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram, south Kerala</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1793-1807</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soil moisture is an important parameter of the earth’s climate system. Regression model for estimation of soil moisture at various depths has been developed using the amount of moisture near the surface layer. The estimated values of soil moisture are tested with the measured moisture values and it is found that the estimations are comparable with the observations. The variation of soil thermal properties with the amount of moisture in isohyperthermic ultisols has been investigated at a tropical site in south Kerala for the year 2008. The soil temperatures at 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.50 m depths and soil moisture at 0.05 and 0.10 m are measured using the hydrometeorological data acquisition system installed at the observational site. For soil water contents ranging between 11 and 42% in the soil layer of depth 0.05–0.10 m, the mean values of the heat capacity, thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and thermal admittance obtained were 2.2466 &#215; 10<sup>−6</sup> Jm<sup>−3</sup>K<sup>−1</sup>, 0.4238 &#215; 10<sup>−6</sup> m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, 0.9658 Wm<sup>−1</sup>K<sup>−1</sup>, 2.1517 Jm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1/2</sup>K<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The magnitudes of the diurnal soil thermal parameters showed strong association with the levels of the water content. The thermal diffusivity was found to increase with the amount of soil moisture, up to about 22% of the volumetric water content, but fell as the water content further increases. Similar patterns of the soil moisture levels were noticeable both for the thermal conductivity and admittance.</p>

				<title>Assessment of groundwater salinity in Nellore district using multi-electrode resistivity imaging technique</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1809-1817</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Multi-electrode resistivity imaging survey with 48 electrodes was carried out to assess the extent of salinity inland, in the shallow subsurface in Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh, in the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB) region. Resistivity data were recorded using Wenner–Schlumberger configuration at nine sites along a profile of about 55 km in length, laid perpendicular to the coast. An average spacing of 6 km is maintained between each site. Assessment of groundwater salinity in the study area was made by joint interpretation of the two-dimensional (2D) geoelectrical models of all the sites together with the geochemical analysis results of water samples and geology. At sites closer to the coast, 2D geoelectrical models of the subsurface indicate low resistivities (2–50 𝛺m) in the depth range from surface up to 15 m. Such low resistivities are due to the high salinity of the groundwater. Geochemical analysis results of water samples at six locations close to the electrical resistivity survey sites also suggest high salinity and high concentrations of total dissolved solids and other chemicals at sites closer to the coast. Away from the coast, the resistivities in the depth range from surface up to 15 m vary in the range of 50–150 𝛺m. Accordingly, the chemical analysis of water samples collected at these sites also showed relatively low levels of salinity and salt concentrations in them. However, away from the coast, the resistivities vary in the range of 150–1500 𝛺m in the depth range from 20–40 m. While the aquaculture and agriculture activities may contribute to high salinity at the sites closer to the coast, the presence of deep-seated paleochannels aiding in transporting seawater inland, and water–rock interactions are suspected to be the chief causes for notable salinity at places away from the coast at shallow depths. We opine that the high salinity at shallow depths, coupled with the deep-seated paleochannels transporting seawater, could pose problems to probe further depths particularly using electromagnetic induction methods in the study region.</p>

				<title>Geomorphic settings of mangrove ecosystem in South Andaman Island: A geospatial approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1819-1830</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mangroves are habitats in the coasts of tropics and subtropics, hence the geomorphology of the coast prevails in both the ocean and the land processes. To study the geomorphic setting of mangroves, it is necessary to explore both the topography of the land and the bathymetry of the sea. In this study, the geomorphic setting of mangroves in the South Andaman Island has been studied in detail using remote sensing and GIS technology. The ortho-rectified IRS satellite image was used to identify and to map the mangroves and the associated features using the visual interpretation technique. Using the GIS technique, topographic and bathymetric DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) were created to understand the geomorphology and its influence on the mangrove ecosystem. This DEM was interpreted with mangrove distribution and its associated features to create the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) of the mangrove ecosystem. Topography and bathymetry of the coast result in three dominant features like rivers, tides and waves, which play a role in shaping the geomorphic settings of mangroves, which are classified into five major types. In this study, it is identified that all the five categories of major geomorphic settings of the mangrove community exist in the south Andaman. In the field surveys, ground truth of topographic elevation, mangrove species, and associated coastal land cover features were identified and confirmed in these geomorphic settings. It is concluded that topography and bathymetry settings of the island play an indispensable role in this fragile mangrove ecosystem.</p>

					<p>Rice areas in India are being mapped for acreage estimation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data under forecasting agricultural output using space, agrometeorology and land-based observations (FASAL) program for over a decade now. Under this study, an attempt was made to segregate rice areas based on variety in parts of Punjab state. Data acquisition was done at critical stages of rice growth. The shift in transplantation in temporal domain and difference in canopy volume formed the basis of characterization of rice crop into two different varieties namely aromatic and non-aromatic. Multitemporal HH polarization data along with rate of change of cross polarization ratio (HH/HV) from July to September 2011 was used. The aromatic rice could be separated from normal rice with 91% accuracy.</p>

				<title>Mantle source characterization of Sylhet Traps, northeastern India: A petrological and geochemical study</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1839-1855</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic data are presented for the Sylhet Trap at the southern flank of the eastern Shillong Plateau, northeastern India, to determine the magma genesis in relation to the Kerguelen plume mantle source. Sylhet Trap rocks are porphyritic tholeiite and have diverse chemical compositions from picro-basalt, basalt, andesite to dacite, but mostly are within the subalkaline field. Major and trace element data were used to identify two distinct magma fractionation trends, a low and medium K series, characterized by relatively flat MORB-like (analogous to Rajmahal Traps (II)) and enriched OIB chondrite-normalized Rare Earth Element (REE) patterns. Initial <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr, <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd$, and <sup>206</sup>Pb/<sup>204</sup>Pb isotope compositions were widely varied, ranging from 0.70435–0.71357, 0.51196–0.51266, and 17.92–19.72, respectively, when compared with basalts from the West Bengal, the Rajmahal Traps and the Kerguelen plume. Correlations among isotopic and trace element ratios of the Sylhet Traps provide evidence for the involvement of (1) HIMU-like mantle component, (2) the Kerguelen plume-like component, and (3) EMII-like crustal component. Magma from the Sylhet Traps was originated from a melting that derived directly from the heterogeneous Kerguelen mantle plume (components 1 and 2), which strongly suggests the presence of the Kerguelen plume-head in the Bengal basin.</p>

				<title>Permian ultrafelsic A-type granite from Besar Islands group, Johor, peninsular Malaysia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1857-1878</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The granitic rocks of the peninsula have traditionally been divided into two provinces, i.e., Western and Eastern provinces, corresponding to S- and I-type granite respectively. The Western Province granite is characterised by megacrystic and coarse-grained biotite, tin-mineralised, continental collision granite, whereas, the Eastern Province granite is bimodal I-type dominated by granodiorite and associated gabbroic of arc type granite. This paper reports the occurrence of an A-type granite from peninsular Malaysia. The rocks occur in the Besar, Tengah, and Hujung islands located in the southeastern part of the peninsula. The granite is highly felsic with SiO<sub>2</sub> ranging from 75.70% to 77.90% (differentiation index = 94.2–97.04). It is weakly peraluminous (average ACNK=1.02), has normative hypersthene (0.09–2.19%) and high alkali content (8.32–8.60%). The granites have many A-type characteristics, among them are shallow level of emplacement, high Ga, Fe<sub>T</sub>/MgO and low P, Sr, Ti, CaO and Nb. Calculated zircon saturation temperatures for the Besar magma ranging from 793&#176; to 806&#176;C is consistent with high temperature partial melting of a felsic infracrustal source which is taken as one of the mechanisms to produce A-type magma. The occurrence of the A-type granite can be related to the extensional back arc basin in the Indo-China terrane during the earliest Permian.</p>

				<title>Palynostratigraphy of Permian succession in the Mand–Raigarh Coalfield, Chhattisgarh, India and phytogeographical provincialism</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1879-1893</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Palynofloras have been recorded from the Barakar Formation in the Borehole MBKW-3, Barpali–Karmitikra Block, Mand–Raigarh Coalfield, Chhattisgarh. Three distinct palynoassemblages have been identified and referred to the following palynoassemblage zones – <i>Gondisporites raniganjensis</i> (Latest Permian); <i>Faunipollenites varius</i> (latest Early Permian), and <i>Scheuringipollenites barakarensis</i> (late Early Permian). It is inferred that these deposits contain the representative palynoassamblages of Early to Late Permian in age. The First Appearance Datum (FAD)s of <i>Arcuatipollenites pellucidus, A. ovatus, Guttulapollenites hannonicus, Lundbladispora microconata, Alisporites opii, Klausipollenites</i> sp., and <i>Goubinispora indica</i> (at 41.95, 45.90, 98.35 m depths), indicate the closing phase of Permian, as these elements are the key species that mark a transition from Permian to the Lower Triassic. An attempt has been made here to reconstruct the phytogeographical provincialism on the basis of <i>Guttulapollenites</i> recorded in this basin.</p>

				<title>Palynostratigraphy of Permian succession from Binja Block, South Karanpura Coalfield, Jharkhand, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1895-1906</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Palynological investigations are carried out on approximately 538.00-m thick Gondwana strata from borehole SKB-1, Binja Block, South Karanpura Coalfield in Jharkhand. Based on the distribution pattern of age marker palynotaxa, two distinct palynoassemblages are identified. Palynoassemblage-I in the lithologically designated Barren Measures and Barakar formations, between 552.00 and 53.20 m depth show dominance of striate bisaccate (<i>Striatopodocarpites, Crescentipollenites</i>, and <i>Faunipollenites</i>) and abundance of nonstriate bisaccate (<i>Scheuringipollenites</i>). Upward the Palynoassemblage-II (39.50–13.80 m depth) is rich in striate bisaccate (<i>Striatopodocarpites</i> and <i>Crescentipollenites</i>) and significant enveloping monosaccate <i>Densipollenites magnicorpus</i> pollen. These strata have been equated with Raniganj Formation of Latest Permian age. The First Appearance Datum (FAD) of <i>Arcuatipollenites pellucidus, Playfordiaspora cancellosa, Alisporites</i> sp., <i>Falcisporites</i> sp. and <i>Krempipollenites indicus</i> observed at 13.80 and 39.50 m depth, mark the transition of Permian into the Lower Triassic. The FADs of <i>Guttulapollenites</i> spp. at 49.10 and 504.70 m, <i>Goubinispora morondavensis</i> at 415.90 m, <i>Alisporites ovalis</i> and <i>Arcuatipollenites</i> sp. at 526.70 m is observed and suggest that these sediments are equivalent to Raniganj Formation, Late Permian in age.</p>

				<title>Geoelectric structure estimated from magnetotelluric data from the Uttarakhand Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1907-1918</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geoelectric strike and resistivity structure of the crust have been estimated from 37 magnetotelluric (MT) data sites along a profile from Roorkee to Gangotri in Uttarakhand Himalaya. Impedance decomposition schemes based on Bahr’s, Groom Bailey and Phase tensor were implemented in a MATLAB code for the average strike estimation. Geoelectric strike direction varies with period as well as in different lithotectonic units along the profile. In the period band from 1 to 100 s average geoelectric strike in the southern end of the profile (Indo-Gangetic Plains) is N79&#176;W, which is slightly rotated to the north in the Lesser Himalayan region and becomes N68&#176;W whereas it is N81&#176;W in the Higher Himalayan region. However, average strike is stabilized to N77&#176;W for the entire profile in the long period band (100–1000 s). Geoelectrical structure of the crust has been obtained along the profile by 2D inversion of MT data. Major features of 2D resistivity model are: (i) southern part of the model is a low resistivity (&gt; 50 𝛺m) zone at shallow depth (5–7 km) representing the loose sediments of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), whose thickness increases in the south; (ii) highly resistive (>1000 𝛺m) layer below the IGP sediments is the basement rock, representing the resistivity of the top of the subducting Indian Plate; (iii) the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and the Main Central Thrust (MCT) zones can be seen in the electrical image. However, the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) could not be resolved and (iv) a low resistivity (&gt; 10 𝛺m) feature in the MCT zone extending to the depth of 30 km is delineated. This low resistivity could be due to fluid-filled fractured rock matrix or partial melt zone. Hypocenters of many earthquakes are concentrated along the boundary of this low resistivity zone and relatively high resistivity blocks around it. The resulted model supports flat-ramp-flat geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust along which the Indian Plate is subducting.</p>

				<title>A new PPP algorithm for deformation monitoring with single-frequency receiver</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1919-1926</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Considering the applications of deformation monitoring, PPP (precise point positioning) with singlefrequency (SF) receivers has the advantages of stand-alone, absolute positioning and cost efficiency. However, the existing SF PPP methods can be hardly implemented for deformation monitoring directly due to their limited precision of submeter level. For this purpose, an innovative approach is presented in this paper with several improvements to the existing approaches: firstly, the SEID (Satellite-specific Epoch-differenced Ionospheric Delay) model is adopted in SF kinematic PPP to handle the ionospheric delays for SF receivers embedded in networks of dual-frequency (DF) receivers; secondly, according to the dynamic characteristic of the monitor station, a combination of kinematic PPP and sliding window based static PPP algorithm is adopted. To confirm the availability of the algorithm for deformation monitoring with SF receiver, a seismic experiment is carried out on an earthquake simulation platform. Comparable positioning precision with 1.5 cm for horizontal and 2.2 cm for vertical is achieved by SF PPP with respect to RTK (real-time kinematic) solution. The new deformation monitoring algorithm with SF receiver can be treated as an effective and low cost way to realize some types of geological hazard monitoring in a wide range.</p>

				<title>Climatology and trends of summer high temperature days in India during 1969–2013</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Based on the daily maximum air temperature data from 176 stations in India from 1969 to 2013, the climatological distribution of the number of days with high temperature (HT) defined as days with maximum temperature higher than 37&#176;C during summer season (March–June) are studied. With a focus on the regional variability and long-term trends, the impacts of HT days are examined by dividing the country into six geographical regions (North, West, North-central, East, South-central and South). Although the long-term (1969–2013) climatological numbers of HT days display well-defined spatial patterns, there is clear change in climatological mean and coefficient of variation of HT days in a recent period (1991–2013). The long period trends indicate increase in summer HT days by 3%, 5%, and 18% in north, west, and south regions, respectively and decrease by 4% and 9% in north-central and east regions respectively. However, spatial variations in HT days exist across different regions in the country. The data analysis shows that 2010 was the warmest summer year and 2013 was the coolest summer year in India. Comparison of spatial distributions of trends in HT days for 1969–1990 and 1991–2013 periods reveal that there is an abrupt increase in the number of HT days over north, west and north-central regions of India probably from mid 1990s. A steep increase in summer HT days in highly populated cities of Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Jaipur, and Visakhapatnam is noticed during the recent period of 1991–2013. The summer HT days over southern India indicate significant positive correlation with Nino 3.4 index for three months’ running mean (December–January–February, January–March, February–April, March–May and April–June).</p>

				<title>Statistical analysis of long term spatial and temporal trends of temperature parameters over Sutlej river basin, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0017-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The annual and seasonal trend analysis of different surface temperature parameters (average, maximum, minimum and diurnal temperature range) has been done for historical (1971–2005) and future periods (2011–2099) in the middle catchment of Sutlej river basin, India. The future time series of temperature data has been generated through statistical downscaling from large scale predictors of CGCM3 and HadCM3 models under A2 scenario. Modified Mann–Kendall test and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) chart have been used for detecting trend and sequential shift in time series of temperature parameters. The results of annual trend analysis for period of 1971–2005 show increasing as well as decreasing trends in average ($T_{\text{Mean}}$), maximum ($T_{\text{Max}}$), minimum ($T_{\text{Min}}$) temperature and increasing trends in Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) at different stations. But the annual trend analysis of downscaled data has revealed statistically significant (95% confidence level) rising trends in $T_{\text{Mean}}$, $T_{\text{Max}}$, $T_{\text{Min}}$ and falling trend in DTR for the period 2011–2099. The decreasing trend in DTR is due to higher rate of increase in $T_{\text{Min}}$ compared to $T_{\text{Max}}$.</p>

				<title>Simulation of the Tornado Event of 22 March, 2013 over Brahmanbaria, Bangladesh using WRF Model with 3DVar DA techniques</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0037-0048</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A severe thunderstorm produced a tornado (F2 on the enhanced Fujita–Pearson scale), which affected the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh during 1100–1130 UTC of 22 March, 2013. The tornado consumed 38, injured 388 and caused a huge loss of property. The total length travelled by the tornado was about 12–15 km and about 1728 households were affected. An attempt has been made to simulate this rare event using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The model was run in a single domain at 9 km resolution for a period of 24 hrs, starting at 0000 UTC on 22 March, 2013. The meteorological conditions that led to form this tornado have been analyzed. The model simulated meteorological conditions are compared with that of a ‘no severe thunderstorm observed day’ on 22 March, 2012. Thus, the model also ran in the same domain at same resolution for 24 hrs, starting at 0000 UTC on 22 March, 2012. The model simulated meteorological parameters are consistent with each other, and all are in good agreement with the observation in terms of the region of occurrence of the tornado activity. The model has efficiently captured the common favourable synoptic conditions for the occurrence of severe tornadoes though there are some spatial and temporal biases in the simulation. The wind speed is not in good agreement with the observation as it has shown the strongest wind of only 15–20 ms<sup>−1</sup>, against the estimated wind speed of about 55 ms<sup>−1</sup>. The spatial distributions as well as intensity of rainfall are also in good agreement with the observation. The results of these analyses demonstrated the capability of high-resolution WRF model with 3DVar Data Assimilation (DA) techniques in simulation of tornado over Brahmanbaria, Bangladesh.</p>

				<title>Uncertainty in a monthly water balance model using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methodology</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0049-0059</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hydrological models are simplified representations of natural processes and subject to errors. Uncertainty bounds are a commonly used way to assess the impact of an input or model architecture uncertainty in model outputs. Different sets of parameters could have equally robust goodness-of-fit indicators, which is known as Equifinality. We assessed the outputs from a lumped conceptual hydrological model to an agricultural watershed in central Chile under strong interannual variability (coefficient of variability of 25%) by using the Equifinality concept and uncertainty bounds. The simulation period ran from January 1999 to December 2006. Equifinality and uncertainty bounds from GLUE methodology (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) were used to identify parameter sets as potential representations of the system. The aim of this paper is to exploit the use of uncertainty bounds to differentiate behavioural parameter sets in a simple hydrological model. Then, we analyze the presence of equifinality in order to improve the identification of relevant hydrological processes. The water balance model for Chillan River exhibits, at a first stage, equifinality. However, it was possible to narrow the range for the parameters and eventually identify a set of parameters representing the behaviour of the watershed (a behavioural model) in agreement with observational and soft data (calculation of areal precipitation over the watershed using an isohyetal map). The mean width of the uncertainty bound around the predicted runoff for the simulation period decreased from 50 to 20 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> after fixing the parameter controlling the areal precipitation over the watershed. This decrement is equivalent to decreasing the ratio between simulated and observed discharge from 5.2 to 2.5. Despite the criticisms against the GLUE methodology, such as the lack of statistical formality, it is identified as a useful tool assisting the modeller with the identification of critical parameters.</p>

				<title>Analysis of drought areas in northern Algeria using Markov chains</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0061-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present work studies the trends in drought in northern Algeria. This region was marked by a severe, wide-ranging and persistent drought due to its extraordinary rainfall deficit. In this study, drought classes are identified using SPI (standardized precipitation index) values. A Markovian approach is adopted to discern the probabilistic behaviour of the time ser ies of the drought. Thus, a transition probability matrix is constructed from drought distribution maps. The trends in changes in drought types and the distribution area are analyzed. The results show that the probability of class severe/extreme drought increases considerably rising from the probability of 0.2650 in 2005 to a stable probability of 0.5756 in 2041.</p>

				<title>Decision Support System integrated with Geographic Information System to target restoration actions in watersheds of arid environment: A case study of Hathmati watershed, Sabarkantha district, Gujarat</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0071-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Watershed morphometric analysis is important for controlling floods and planning restoration actions. The present study is focused on the identification of suitable sites for locating water harvesting structures using morphometric analysis and multi-criteria based decision support system. The Hathmati watershed of river Hathmati at Idar taluka, Sabarkantha district, Gujarat is experiencing excessive runoff and soil erosion due to high intensity rainfall. Earth observation dataset such as Digital Elevation Model and Geographic Information System are used in this study to determine the quantitative description of the basin geometry. Several morphometric parameters such as stream length, elongation ratio, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, stream frequency, texture ratio, form factor, circularity ratio, and compactness coefficient are taken into account for prioritization of Hathmati watershed. The overall analysis reveals that Hathmati comprises of 13 mini-watersheds out of which, the watershed number 2 is of utmost priority because it has the highest degradation possibilities. The final results are used to locate the sites suitable for water harvesting structures using geo-visualization technique. After all the analyses, the best possibilities of check dams in the mini-watersheds that can be used for soil and water conservation in the watershed are presented.</p>

				<title>Monitoring implementation of desertification combating plan using geomatics – A case study, districts Dhar and Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0087-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The world’s drylands are subject to desertification as a result of extended droughts, climate change, and human activities. Development in drylands depends on addressing degradation of the ecosystem, main-streaming sustainable natural resources management, and building upon the existing adaptive capacities of communities and institutions. In this regard, recent scientific results aimed to promote sustainable development through action plans for combating desertification. In India, under the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD) programme, remote sensing based integrated land and water resource studies were carried out with an objective to generate locale specific action plans for sustainable development of a region. A specific study was carried out, in districts of Jhabua and Dhar, in Madhya Pradesh using Composite Land Development Sites (CLDS) approach for forest and wasteland development and soil and water conservation. Various treatments were suggested and implemented in 1995. The present study was carried out with an objective to monitor the positive impacts of combating plan implementation through visual interpretation and NDVI analysis of temporal images of LISS III data, since 1991 to 2013. The study reveals that there is substantial increase in the area of irrigated agricultural land with increase in number of check dams along with the stream channels.</p>

				<title>Detection of snow melt and freezing in Himalaya using OSCAT data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0101-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A study of the snow cover melt and freeze using Ku band Oceansat scatterometer (OSCAT) HH polarised backscatter coefficient (𝜎<sup>0</sup><sub>HH</sub>) for 2011 and 2012 is reported for the Himalayas, which contain the world’s largest reserve of ice and snow outside polar regions. The analysis shows spatial and temporal inter-annual variations in the onset of melt/freeze across four regions (Upper Himalaya, Western Himalaya, Central Himalaya, and Eastern Himalaya), nine elevation bands and four aspect zones. A threshold based on temperature–𝜎<sup>0</sup><sub>HH</sub> relation and average 𝜎<sup>0</sup><sub>HH</sub> for the months January–March was used for melt/freeze detection. When the three consecutive images (6 days) satisfied the threshold, the day of first image was selected as melt onset/freeze day. The average melt onset dates were found to be March 11 &#177; 11 days for Eastern Himalaya, April 3 &#177; 18 days for Central Himalaya, April 16 &#177; 27 days for Western Himalaya, and May 12 &#177; 18 days for Upper Himalaya. Similarly average freeze onset dates were found to be August 23 &#177; 27 days for Eastern Himalaya, September 08 &#177; 24 days for Central Himalaya, August 27 &#177; 11 days for Western Himalaya, and September 13 &#177; 11 days for Upper Himalaya. All the zones experienced the melt onset earlier by around 20 days in 2011 at elevation above 5000 m. All the zones experienced freeze earlier in 2012, with onset being 18, 19, 11, and 21 days earlier in Eastern, Central, Western, and Upper Himalaya, respectively.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of water isotopes and hydrograph separation during the spring flood period in Yushugou River basin, Eastern Tianshans, China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0115-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many of the river basins in northwest China receive water from melting glaciers and snow in addition to groundwater. This region has experienced a significant change in glacier and snowpack volume over the past decade altering hydrology. Quantifying changes in water resources is vital for developing sustainable strategies in the region. During 2013, a water-isotope source apportionment study was conducted during the spring flood in the Yushugou River basin, northwestern China. The study found significant differences in water isotopes between river water, snowmelt water, and groundwater. During the study period, the isotopic composition of groundwater remained relatively stable. This stability suggests that the groundwater recharge rate has not been significantly impacted by recent hydro-climatic variability. The river water flow rate and water 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O displayed an inverse relationship. This relationship is indicative of snowmelt water injection. The relative contribution of the two sources was estimated using a two-component isotope hydrograph separation. The contribution of snowmelt water and groundwater to Yushugou River were $\sim$63% and $\sim$37%, respectively. From the study, we conclude that snowmelt water is the dominant water source to the basin during the spring melt period.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of aquifer protective capacity of overburden unit and soil corrosivity in Makurdi, Benue state, Nigeria, using electrical resistivity method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0125-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents result of 30 vertical electrical soundings carried out in Makurdi, Benue state capital, north–central Nigeria to evaluate aquifer protective capacity and soil corrosivity of overburden units in the study area. This was done using the Schlumberger electrode array to obtain the data and was modelled using computer iteration (Winresist software). The field data gives a resolution with 3–4 geoelectric layers and the observed frequencies in curve types include: 30% of KQ, 16.67% of QH, 6.67% of AA and K, 3.33% of HA, Q and A, 10% of H, KH and HK. Using the longitudinal unit conductance (S), the protective capacities of the study area were classified as 36.67% weak, 10% poor, 40% moderate, and 13.33% as good. The corrosivity ratings of the study area show that 10% is strongly corrosive, 23% moderately corrosive, 37% slightly corrosive, and 30% noncorrosive The results reasonably provide information on areas where industries can be sited and iron pipes can be laid in order to safeguard the hydrological setting for resident’s safety in the study area. Regions with moderate/good protective capacity are good sites for locating boreholes.</p>

				<title>Investigation of vertical mass changes in the south of Izmir (Turkey) by monitoring microgravity and GPS/GNSS methods</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0137-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The monitoring of gravity changes in a region enables the investigation of regional structural elements depending upon the changes in load compensation. This method, preferred in recent years, has yielded good results from different parts of the world for determination of the deformation at fields. With the addition of GPS/GNSS monitoring to microgravity studies, the mass changes within the crust in vertical directional movements of a region can be estimated. During GPS/GNSS monitoring and microgravity studies, it was found that the behaviour of vertical directions of Izmir and the surrounding areas, indicate an active tectonic regime and high seismic activity, especially since 2000. As a result, regions considered to have a mass change in vertical direction were determined by 3-year measurements and it was found that they were consistently highly seismic.</p>

				<title>CSAMT investigations of the Caferbeyli (Manisa/Turkey) geothermal area</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0149-0159</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Western Turkey is one of the most remarkable regions of very active continental extension in the world. The most significant structures of this region are Alaşehir, Gediz, and Büyük Menderes Grabens. Geothermal activity around city of Manisa in Gediz Graben has been investigated by many researchers and many geothermal boreholes were drilled in order to produce electricity and for heating purposes. The Caferbeyli geothermal area is on the southern side of the Gediz Graben just west of Salihli, Manisa, Turkey. According to rising demand on thermal water around Salihli, geophysical studies were performed using the Controlled Source Audio Magnetotellurics (CSAMT) measurements near the area of Cafer-beyli, and they were interpreted by the two-dimensional modelling. Vertical and horizontal resistivity sections were mapped, and it was determined that a low-resistivity layer exists in the SW part of the survey area. As a result of the studies in the area, the boundaries of the low-resistivity layer were mapped and a test drilling was recommended.</p>

				<title>Influence of rigid boundary on the propagation of torsional surface wave in an inhomogeneous layer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0161-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present work illustrates a theoretical study on the effect of rigid boundary for the propagation of torsional surface wave in an inhomogeneous crustal layer over an inhomogeneous half space. It is believed that the inhomogeneity in the half space arises due to hyperbolic variation in shear modulus and density whereas the layer has linear variation in shear modulus and density. The dispersion equation has been obtained in a closed form by using Whittaker’s function, which shows the variation of phase velocity with corresponding wave number. Numerical results show the dispersion equations, which are discussed and presented by means of graphs. Results in some special cases are also compared with existing solutions available from analytical methods, which show a close resemblance. It is also observed that, for a layer over a homogeneous half space, the velocity of torsional waves does not coincide with that of Love waves in the presence of the rigid boundary, whereas it does at the free boundary. Graphical user interface (GUI) software has been developed using MATLAB 7.5 to generalize the effect of various parameter discussed.</p>

				<title>Evolution process of the Late Silurian–Late Devonian tectonic environment in Qimantagh in the western portion of east Kunlun, China: Evidence from the geochronology and geochemistry of granitoids</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0171-0196</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The East Kunlun Orogenic Belt has undergone a composite orogenic process consisting of multiple orogenic cycles and involving many types of magmatic rocks spread over the whole district. However, due to bad natural geographical conditions and complex superimposed orogenic processes, most of the Caledonian orogenic traces were modified by the late tectonic uplift and denudation, so these rocks are poorly studied. Multiperiodic magmatic activity during the Late Silurian (approximately 420 Ma)–Late Devonian (approximately 380 Ma) exists in the Qimantagh area. We obtained 5 zircon U–Pb ages from the Late Silurian–Late Devonian granitoids in the Qimantagh area. Those ages are 420.6 &#177; 2.6 Ma(Nalingguole biotite monzogranite), 421.2 &#177; 1.9 Ma (Wulanwuzhuer potassium granite), 403.7 &#177; 2.9 Ma (Yemaquan granodiorite), 391.3 &#177; 3.2 Ma (Qunli granite porphyry), and 380.52 &#177; 0.92 Ma (Kayakedengtage granodiorite). These granitoids belong to the sub-alkaline, high-K calc-alkaline, metaluminous or weakly or strongly peraluminous series. The rocks are right oblique types, having overall relative LREE enrichment and HREE depletion, though rocks from different times may exhibit different degrees of Eu anomalies or overall moderate Eu depletion. The rocks are rich in large ion lithophile elements (LILE), such as Rb, Th, and K, and high field strength elements (HFSE), such as Zr and Hf, and are depleted in Ba, Nb, Ta, Sr, P, Eu, and Ti. The rocks have complex composition sources. The Late Silurian granitoids are mainly crust-derived. Most of the Devonian granitoids are crust-mantle mixed-source and only some parts of them are crust-derived, especially the Middle Devonian granitoids. Those mid-acidic and acidic intrusive rocks are formed in a post-collision tectonic setting, lithosphere delamination may have occurred in the Early Devonian (407 Ma), and the study area subsequently experienced an underplating of the mantle-derived magma at least until the Late Devonian (380 Ma).</p>

					<p>The Bundelkhand Gneissic Complex (BnGC) in the central part of the Bundelkhand massif preserves a supracrustal unit which includes pelitic (garnet–cordierite–sillimanite gneiss, garnet–sillimanite gneiss, biotite gneiss and garnet–biotite gneiss) and mafic (hornblende–biotite gneiss and garnetiferous amphibolite) rocks. Granulite facies metamorphism of the complex initiated with breaking down of biotite to produce garnet and cordierite in the pelitic gneisses. Geothermobarometric calculations indicate metamorphic conditions of 720&#176;C/6.2 kbar, followed by a retrograde (687&#176;C/4.9 kbar) to very late retro-grade stages of metamorphism (579&#176;C/4.4 kbar) which is supported by the formation of late cordierite around garnet. The P–T conditions and textural relations of the garnet–cordierite-bearing gneiss suggest a retrograde cooling path of metamorphism.</p>

				<title>Paragenesis of Cr-rich muscovite and chlorite in green-mica quartzites of Saigaon–Palasgaon area, Western Bastar Craton, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0213-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Green mica (fuchsite or chromian-muscovite) is reported worldwide in the Archaean metasedimentary rocks, especially quartzites. They are generally associated with a suite of heavy minerals and a range of phyllosilicates. We report the occurrence of green-mica quartzites in the Saigaon–Palasgaon area within Bastar Craton in central India. Mineralogical study has shown that there are two types of muscovites; the chromium-containing muscovite (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.84–1.84%) and muscovite (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.00–0.22%). Chlorites are chromium-containing chlorites (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 3.66–5.39%) and low-chromium-containing chlorites (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 0.56–2.62%), and as such represent ripidolite–brunsvigite varieties. Back scattered electron images and EPMA data has revealed that chlorite occurs in two forms, viz., parallel to subparallel stacks in the form of intergrowth with muscovite and independent crystals within the matrix. The present study indicates that the replacement of chromium-containing chlorite by chromium-containing muscovite is found to be due to increasing grade of metamorphism of chromium-rich sediments. However, the absence of significant compositional gap between aforementioned varieties indicates disparate substitution of cations, especially chromium, within matrix chlorites. The chromium-containing muscovite and muscovite are two separate varieties having distinct paragenesis.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0227-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fossil leaves of <i>Lagerstroemia</i> (Lythraceae) are described from the Siwalik deposits (middle Miocene) of Kathgodam, Uttarakhand, India. The fossil records of the Lythraceae indicate its worldwide distribution in the Cenozoic. The family had its widest distribution during the Miocene but became less widespread during the Pliocene, followed by range expansion during the Quaternary. The present leaf fossil, along with the previous fossil records of <i>Lagerstroemia</i>, indicates that the genus followed the same pattern of expansion and retraction as the entire family Lythraceae suggesting that both the genus and the family adapted in similar ways. The fossil plant assemblage from the Lower Siwalik deposits indicates warm and humid climate with plenty of rainfall in the region during the depositional period.</p>

				<title>The role of impact and radiogenic heating in the early thermal evolution of Mars</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0241-0260</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The planetary differentiation models of Mars are proposed that take into account core–mantle and coremantle–crust differentiation. The numerical simulations are presented for the early thermal evolution of Mars spanning up to the initial 25 million years (Ma) of the early solar system, probably for the first time, by taking into account the radiogenic heating due to the short-lived nuclides, <sup>26</sup>Al and <sup>60</sup>Fe. The influence of impact heating during the accretion of Mars is also incorporated in the simulations. The early accretion of Mars would necessitate a substantial role played by the short-lived nuclides in its heating. <sup>26</sup>Al along with impact heating could have provided sufficient thermal energy to the entire body to substantially melt and trigger planetary scale differentiation. This is contrary to the thermal models based exclusively on the impact heating that could not produce widespread melting and planetary differentiation. The early onset of the accretion of Mars perhaps within the initial $\sim$1.5 Ma in the early solar system could have resulted in substantial differentiation of Mars, provided, it accreted over the timescale of $\sim$1 Ma. This seems to be consistent with the chronological records of the Martian meteorites.</p>

				<title>Survey of land subsidence – case study: The land subsidence formation in artificial recharge ponds at South Hamadan Power Plant, northwest of Iran</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0261-0268</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The artificial recharge is a technique of aquifer conservation for land subsidence. But in this article, the phenomenon of land subsidence and the resulting cracks and fissures at the study area are formed in recharge ponds. This is a new phenomenon and in this research the geometrical properties of the fissures of recharge ponds are measured. The results reveal the existence of fine layers in the geology of the aquifer, which are displaced in the long run as the consequence of groundwater overdraft. At the site of the artificial recharge subject of this research, the difference between the quality of recharge water and the aquifer and their interaction have intensified the instability and the movement of the fine sediments. In addition, the neglect of hydraulic principles of the groundwater during the construction and operation of the recharge wells has resulted in turbulent and speed flows, intensified displacement of fine sediments and ultimately the localized subsidence at the site of the plan.</p>

				<title>Climate change and its role in forecasting energy demand in buildings: A case study of Douala City, Cameroon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0269-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The foremost role of a building is to assure the comfort of its occupants. The thermal comfort of a building depends on the outdoor climate and requires a demand in energy for heating and cooling. In this paper, demand of energy (heating/cooling) in the buildings is discussed in Douala, Cameroon. Daily data of the last 40 years coming from five weather stations of Cameroon have been studied. Some forecasts have been carried out with 14 GCM models, associated to three future climate scenarios B1, A2, and A1B. However, only INCM3 of General Circulation Model (GCM) and A2 scenario was used. Energy demand in buildings is valued by HDD (heating degree day) and CDD (cooling degree day) indices. Obtained results show that the temperature evolves more quickly in dry season than in rainy season in Douala. Climate rise indicates an increasing demand of energy in the buildings for cooling. Global Douala heating shows a definite effect on outdoor comfort. From 2045 to 2075, the demand of energy for cooling will be superior to 50%. The total demand in energy for heating in the buildings is estimated to be 67.882 kcal from 1970 to 2000 and will be around 67.774 kcal from 2013 to 2043.</p>

				<title>GPS-based ionospheric tomography with a constrained adaptive simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0283-0289</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper, a constrained adaptive simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (CASART) is presented to obtain high-quality reconstructions from insufficient projections. According to the continuous smoothness of the variations of ionospheric electron density (IED) among neighbouring voxels, Gauss weighted function is introduced to constrain the tomography system in the new method. It can resolve the dependence on the initial values for those voxels without any GPS rays traversing them. Numerical simulation scheme is devised to validate the feasibility of the new algorithm. Some comparisons are made to demonstrate the superiority of the new method. Finally, the actual GPS observations are applied to further validate the feasibility and superiority of the new algorithm.</p>

				<title>Climatology of ionosphere over low-latitude (Kolkata) using FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellite observation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0291-0301</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have analyzed the diurnal, monthly, and seasonal variation in NmF2, HmF2, and IECs parameters derived from the COSMIC-RO observation over the low-latitude (Kolkata) region during 2008–2012 and compared the result with the IRI-2007 model output. In general, during HSA period the seasonal averaged model outcome prominently overestimates the observed values throughout the day, except HmF2, while in LSA period it is confined to post-noon hours. The differences between diurnal-dip and diurnal-peak values of all these parameters are considerably higher in the model outcomes than those of observed values, especially during increasing solar activity. In addition, the monthly averaged NmF2, BIEC, and TIEC values at noon and midnight, obtained from the both options, exhibit semi-annual variation, which are in good agreement with some earlier studies, whereas HmF2 shows annual variability for all solar activity. Moreover, the similarities and dissimilarities observed in variation pattern, particularly during 2011 and 2012, can help the research community to understand the recent trends of ionospheric parameters and develop the IRI model with more efficiency to fit the observed profile in a better way.</p>

				<title>Simulation of Indian summer monsoon using the Japan Meteorological Agency’s seasonal ensemble prediction system</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0321-0333</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The performance of a dynamical seasonal forecast system is evaluated for the prediction of summer monsoon rainfall over the Indian region during June–September (JJAS) by using hindcast of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seasonal ensemble prediction system (EPS) model, based on five ensembles of March, April and May initial states for a period of 32 years (1979–2010).</p>
					<p>The hindcast climatology during JJAS simulates the mean monsoon circulation at lower and upper tropospheres very well in JMA model using March, April and May ensembles with a more realistic simulation of Webster and Yang’s broad scale monsoon circulation index. The JMA hindcast climatology during JJAS simulates the rainfall maxima over the west-coast of India and the head Bay of Bengal reasonably well, although, the latter is slightly shifted southwestward. Associated with better forecast skills of El Nino in the JMA model, the interannual variability of All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) during the 32-year period has also been very well simulated with a high significant (99% level) correlation in April ensemble followed by that of March and May ensembles. Thus, the present analysis indicates that the JMA seasonal forecast model can prove to be a useful tool for the dynamical seasonal forecast of AISMR.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of precipitation and river discharge variations over southwestern Iran during recent decades</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0335-0352</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigates trend and change point in the annual and monthly precipitation and river discharge time series for a 56-year period (1956/57–2011/12). The analyses were carried out for 17 rain gauge stations and 13 hydrometric stations located in the southwest regions of Iran. Five statistical tests of Mann–Kendall, Spearman, Sequential Mann–Kendall, Pettitt and Sen’s slope estimator were utilized for the analysis. The relationships between the precipitation and river discharge series were also examined by the Pearson correlation test. The results obtained for the precipitation time series indicated that most of the stations were characterized by insignificant trends for both the annual and monthly series. The analysis of discharge trends revealed a significant increase during both the annual and October through April series. The magnitude of significant increasing trends in annual river discharge ranged between 6.65 and 20.49 m3/s per decade. The highest number of significant trends in the monthly river discharge series was observed in January and February, accounting for seven and four trends respectively. Furthermore, most of the annual and monthly river discharge series showed significant change points in the 1970s. It was also found that river discharge was strongly correlated with precipitation at the annual scale and for most of the months.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper looks at glacier area change in the Tomur Peak for the 1964/71–2000 and 2000–2011 periods. The results show that the total area of the selected 78 glaciers has decreased from 555.45 km<sup>2</sup> in 1964/71 to 530.39 km<sup>2</sup> in 2000, and further reduced to 521.89 km<sup>2</sup> in 2011. Overall, the selected glaciers have lost 4.50% of their surface area between 1964/71 and 2000, and have lost 1.60% more between 2000 and 2011. The area reduction rate of the 78 glaciers increased from 0.12%/a during 1964/71–2000 to 0.13%/a during 2000–2011. In addition, this paper describes a method for estimating the ice surface elevation change using the SRTM (2000) and elevation data generated from topographic maps (1964/71) to quantify the ice thickness change for the 1964/71–2000 period. The surface elevation for about 73.50% of grid area decreased, mostly in the glacier ablation zone. The overall average thickness loss is 22.35 m which yields an annual loss of 0.60 m/a.</p>

				<title>Decline in snowfall in response to temperature in Satluj basin, western Himalaya</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0365-0382</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Snow is an essential resource present in the Himalaya. Therefore, monitoring of the snowfall changes over a time period is important for hydrological and climatological purposes. In this study, variability of snowfall from 1976–2008 were analysed and compared with variability in temperature ($T$<sub>max</sub> and $T$<sub>min</sub>) from 1984–2008 using simple linear regression analysis and Mann–Kendall test in the Satluj Basin. The annual, seasonal, and monthly analyses of average values of snowfall and temperature ($T$<sub>max</sub> and $T$<sub>min</sub>) have been carried out. The study also consists an analysis of average values of annual snowfall and temperature over six elevation zones (&#60;1500 to &#62;4000 m amsl). During the study, it was observed that the snowfall exhibited declining trends in the basin. The snowfall trends are more sensitive to the climate change below an elevation of 4000 m amsl. Over the elevation zones of 3000–3500 and 4000–4500 m amsl, positive trends of mean annual values of snowfall were observed that may be due to higher precipitation as snowfall at these higher elevations. Although, both negative and positive snowfall trends were statistically insignificant, however, if this decreasing trend in snowfall continues, it may result in significant however, changes in future. Furthermore, the $T$<sub>min</sub> is also increasing with statistically significant positive trend at 95% confidence level for November, winter season, annually as well as for the elevation zones of 2500–3000, 3000–3500, and 3500–4000 m amsl. There are dominantly increasing trends in $T$<sub>max</sub> with negative trends for February, June–September, monsoon season, and for elevation zone &#60;1500 m amls. It is important to state that in the present basin, during the months of winter season, most of the precipitation is produced as snowfall by the westerly weather disturbances. Thus, the declining nature in snowfall is concurrent with the positive trends in temperature particularly $T$<sub>min</sub>, therefore, reflecting that the positive trends in $T$<sub>min</sub> may be the dominant factor besides $T$<sub>max</sub> in controlling the snowfall trends. The snowfall data were also compared with SCA and this showed a highly positive correlation of 0.95% which validates the utilisation of time series of snowfall for the trend analysis.</p>

				<title>The health of benthic diatom assemblages in lower stretch of a lesser Himalayan glacier-fed river, Mandakini</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0383-0394</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study examines the ecological state of epilithic diatom assemblages along the lower stretch of Mandakini, a glacier-fed Himalayan river. The diatoms were sampled at four stations during winter and summer, only once in each season. Valve counts were obtained from Naphrax mounts prepared from each sample. Assemblages were recorded for each location. The software OMNIDIA Ver. 5.3 was used for computing the ecological values from the sample counts. Normally <i>Achnanthidium</i> spp. dominated the assemblages, except <i>Nitzschia fonticola</i> (Grunow) at S1 (Kund) and <i>Encyonema minutum</i> (Hilse in Rabh) at S4 (Rudraprayag), only during summer. The ecological values revealed that the assemblages were in 𝛽-mesosaprobic and mésotraphentic states. However, at S4, trophic state was observed to be eutraphentic. Louis Leclercq index indicated that organic pollution was nonexistent, while the anthropogenic eutrophication was low except at S2 (Tilwara) and S3 (Medanpur) in summer and was moderate at S4 in winter characterized by a lean flow. The most abundant indicator taxa for anthropogenic eutrophication are varied; <i>Cymbella tumida</i> (Brebisson-Van Heurck) at S1, <i>Encyonema minutum</i> at S2, S4 while <i>Surirella aungusta</i> (Kutzing) at S3. Ordination showed that the taxa indicating degradation and anthropogenic eutrophication figured as characteristic taxa at respective locations.</p>

				<title>Variations and trends of terrestrial NPP and its relation to climate change in the 10 CMIP5 models</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0395-0403</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using global terrestrial ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) data, we validated the simulated multi-model ensemble (MME) NPP, analyzed the spatial distribution of global NPP and explored the relationship between NPP and climate variations in historical scenarios of 10 CMIP5 models. The results show that the global spatial pattern of simulated terrestrial ecosystem NPP, is consistent with IGBP NPP, but the values have some differences and there is a huge uncertainty. Considering global climate change, near surface temperature is the major factor affecting the terrestrial ecosystem, followed by the precipitation. This means terrestrial ecosystem NPP is more closely related to near surface temperature than precipitation. Between 1976 and 2005, NPP shows an obvious increasing temporal trend, indicating the terrestrial ecosystem has had a positive response to climate change. MME NPP has increased 3.647PgC during historical period, which shows an increasing temporal trend of 3.9 gCm<sup>−2</sup>&#8729;100 yr<sup>−2</sup> in the past 150 years, also indicating that the terrestrial ecosystem has shown a positive response to climate change in past 150 years.</p>

				<title>Effects of geological structures on groundwater flow and quality in hardrock regions of northern Tirunelveli district, southern India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0405-0418</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Geological and structural influences on groundwater flow and quality were evaluated in the present study in the hardrock regions of Tirunelveli District, southern India. Groundwater is a major source of freshwater in this region to cater to the requirements of domestic and agricultural activity, as there are no surface water resources. Geologically, the area is characterized by charnockites and garnetiferous biotite gneiss. Groundwater in this region is found to occur in the weathered portion under unconfined condition and in fractured/fissured portions under unconfined to semi-confined condition. Existence of deep-seated fractures are minimal. Lineaments/dykes play a major role in the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the region. Lineaments/dykes of the study area can be broadly divided into two types: north–south and west–east oriented structures. Analysis and field observations revealed that the north–south dykes act as a barrier of groundwater while the west–east oriented structures behave as a carrier of groundwater. Both quality and quantity of groundwater is different on the upstream and downstream sides of the dyke. Hence, it is conclusive that the west–east oriented dykes in this region are highly potential and act as a conduit for groundwater movement from recharge areas to the discharge area.</p>

				<title>Physico-chemical characteristics of Jharkhand and West Bengal thermal springs along SONATA mega lineament, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0419-0430</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The chemical and isotopic compositions of thermal springs located along the Son–Narmada–Tapti (SONATA) mega lineament in central India have been investigated. The issuing temperatures of the thermal waters vary from 31&#176; to 89&#176;C for the thermal springs and 24&#176; to 25&#176;C for the cold springs. These thermal springs are located on the Archean Chotanagpur Gneissic Complex (CGC) in the eastern part of peninsular India. The thermal springs are mostly alkaline in nature with pH varying from 7.5 to 9.5. Piper diagram suggests that the chemistry of the thermal waters is compatible with the granitic host rocks through which the waters circulate. Mineral saturation index suggests that the thermal waters are saturated with cristobalite and quartz at lower temperatures (less than $\sim$130 to 150&#176;C), and calcite and forsterite at higher temperatures ($\sim$160&#176; to 250&#176;C). The estimated reservoir temperature based on chemical geothermometers is in the range of 132&#176;–265&#176;C, which favours a medium enthalpy geothermal system. Oxygen isotope fractionation of Bakreswar and Tantloi thermal springs highlights a higher reservoir temperature than estimated by chemical geothermometer. Positive gravity anomalies over Bakreswar and Tantloi areas strongly suggest a basement/mantle upliftment or mafic intrusion which could account for the heat source close to the surface. However, the large negative gravity anomaly depression around the Surajkund and Katkamsandi thermal springs indicates presence of deep seated faults.</p>

				<title>Landslide susceptibility zonation in part of Tehri reservoir region using frequency ratio, fuzzy logic and GIS</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0431-0448</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A comprehensive study for the identification of landslide susceptible zones using landslide frequency ratio and fuzzy logic in GIS environment is presented for Tehri reservoir rim region (Uttarakhand, India). Temporal remote sensing data was used to prepare important landslide causative factor layers and landslide inventory. Primary and secondary topographic attributes namely slope, aspect, relative relief, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, and stream power index, were derived from digital elevation model. Landslide frequency ratio technique was adopted to correlate factors with landslides. Further, fuzzy logic method was applied for the integration of factors (causative factor) to map landslide susceptible zones. Normalized landslide frequency ratio value was used for the fuzzy membership function and different fuzzy operators were considered for the preparation of landslide susceptibility/hazard index map. The factors considered in this study were found to be carrying a wide range of information. Accordingly, a methodology was evolved to integrate the factors using combined fuzzy gamma and fuzzy OR operation. Fuzzy gamma integration was performed for six different gamma values (range: 0–1). Gamma value of 0.95 was selected for the preparation of final susceptibility map. Landslide susceptibility index map was divided into the following five hazard zones – very low, low, moderate, high, and very high – on the basis of natural break classification. Validation of the model was performed by using cumulative percentage curve technique. Area under curve value of cumulative percentage curve of proposed landslide susceptibility map (gamma = 0.95) was found to be 0.834 and it can be said that 83.4% accuracy was achieved by applying combined fuzzy logic and landslide frequency ratio method.</p>

				<title>Reorientation of lineation in the Central Crystalline Zone, Munsiari–Milam area of the Kumaun Greater Himalaya</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0449-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>During large scale ductile shear deformation, linear features of the rocks tend to be reoriented towards the direction of bulk shear. This is demonstrated in a crustal scale shear zone of the Himalaya, the Main Central Thrust (MCT), typically exposed in the Munsiari–Milam area of eastern Kumaun Greater Himalaya. Along the MCT, the crystalline rocks of the Greater Himalaya are thrust over the younger sedimentary belt of the Lesser Himalaya. In the study area, the scatter of lineation orientation in the vicinity of the MCT has been observed to drastically reduce within 27&#176; in a zone of about 18 km (about 13 km in the crystalline rocks and about 5 km in the sedimentary rocks). Beyond this zone, the scatter is very high, up to 70&#176; or more. The low scatter of lineation orientation around the MCT could be related to the strong ductile shear deformation associated with the movement along this thrust due to which the linear features got reoriented towards the direction of bulk shear. Away from this zone, ductile shearing had negligible or no effect on the rocks and, therefore, the scatter of lineation remains very high.</p>

				<title>Geochemistry of PGE in mafic rocks of east Khasi Hills, Shillong Plateau, NE India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0459-0475</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mafic rocks of east Khasi Hills of the Meghalaya Plateau, northeastern India, occur as an intrusive body which cut across the weakly metamorphosed Shillong Group of rocks. Other than Shillong Group of rocks, high grade Archaean gneissic rocks and younger porphyritic granites are also observed in the study area. The studied mafic rocks of east Khasi Hills cover an area of about 4 km<sup>2</sup> and represent structurally controlled intrusion and varying grades of deformation. Structurally, these mafic rocks can be divided into massive type of mafic rocks, which are more or less deformation free and foliated type of mafic rocks that experienced deformation. Petrographically, this massive type can be classified as leuco-hornblende-gabbro whereas foliated type can be designated as amphibolite. On the basis of major oxide geochemistry, the investigated mafic rocks can be discriminated into high titanium (HT) (TiO<sub>2</sub> &#62; 2 wt%) and low titanium (LT) types (TiO<sub>2</sub> &#60; 2 wt%). Use of several geochemical variation diagrams, consideration of chondrite-normalized and mantle-normalized REE and PGE plots suggest role of magmatic differentiation (with almost no role of plagioclase fractionation) in a subduction controlled tectonic environment. The PGE trends of the studied rocks suggest relative enrichment of palladium group of PGE (PPGE) compared to iridium group PGE (IPGE). Critical consideration of Sm <i>vs.</i> La, Cu <i>vs.</i> La, Pd <i>vs.</i> La and Cu/Pd <i>vs.</i> La/Sm plots strongly favours generation of the parent magma at a columnar melting regime with batch melting of cylindrical column of the parent mantle to the tune of $\sim$25%. The characteristic PGE behaviours of the presently investigated mafic rocks of east Khasi Hills can be typically corroborated as ‘orogenic’ (discordant) type. These rocks have an enriched mantle affinity with a co-magmatic lineage and they have been generated by slab-dehydration, wedge-melting and assimilation fractional crystallization process at a continental margin arc setting.</p>

				<title>Heavy mineral variation in the deep sea sediment of southeastern Arabian Sea during the past 32 kyr</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0477-0486</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is based on heavy mineral assemblages (HM) of top 104-cm thick section of gravity core SK 221 (Lat. 8&#176;7.12&#8242;N; Long. 73&#176;16.38&#8242;E and water depth – 2188 m) located near the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge in the southeastern Arabian Sea to evaluate the provenance and paleoenvironmental changes during the last 32 kyr. The biogenic carbonate, acid insoluble residue, magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon (TOC) and clay based humidity index, i.e., kaolinite/illite ratio are also utilized to correlate with the above paleoenvironmental changes. Ilmenite, garnet, staurolite, pyroxenes, andalusite and zircon are the dominant HM with moderate to low ZTR (zircon-tourmaline-rutile) index indicating instability of the sediments and rapid erosion in the source region. The characteristic HM suggest their mixed sources from the basic igneous, gneisses/granites, high grade metamorphic rocks and sandstones occurring mainly in the western and southwestern India. The temporal variations of HM, AIR (acid insoluble residue), MS (magnetic susceptibility), biogenic carbonate and C<sub>org</sub> (TOC) during preglacial and early Holocene suggest intensive weathering, erosion, and transportation of terrigenous detritus from continental region by fluvial processes and summer monsoon led high biogenic productivity, respectively. The convective mixing of waters due to intense winter monsoon resulted in very high biogenic carbonate content during the early stages of glacial period. The HM and associated proxies indicated that the winter monsoons of Heinrich (H3, H2, and H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) events and summer monsoons of Bølling/Allerød (BA) event were not strong enough to bring drastic changes in the above parameters.</p>

				<title>Accuracy of Cartosat-1 DEM and its derived attribute at multiple scale representation</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0487-0495</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Digital Elevation Model (DEM) provides basic information about terrain relief and is used for morphological characterisation, hydrological modelling and infrastructural studies. This paper investigates the accuracy of DEM and its derived attributes in multiple scales. This study was carried out for a part of Shiwalik Himalaya using Cartosat-1 stereo pair data. DEM at various cell sizes were generated and information content was compared using mean elevation, variance and entropy statistics. Various post-spacing DEMs were validated to understand variation in vertical accuracy along different scales. The vertical accuracy (3.14–7.24 m) is affected in larger spacing DEM and elevation is underestimated. Slope of terrain also has similar impacts. The DEM and slope accuracy are also affected by the terrain roughness while assessing coarser grid size.</p>

				<title>Latitudinal variation in the occurrence of GPS L-band scintillations associated with the day-to-day changes in TEC, h&#8242;F and the E&#215;B drift velocity and their impact on GPS satellite signals</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0497-0513</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study describes the day-to-day variations in the occurrence of GPS L-band scintillations from equator to the anomaly crest location associated with the changes in TEC, h&#8242;F and E&#215;B drift velocities. The GPS–TEC and S<sub>4</sub> index data from an equatorial station, Trivandrum (8.47&#176;N, 76.91&#176;E), a low latitude station, Waltair (17.7&#176;N, 83.3&#176;E) and an anomaly crest location Kolkata (22.6&#176;N, 88.4&#176;E) during the low solar activity years of 2004 and 2005 are used. It is observed that the day-time ambient TEC is higher during scintillation days compared to that during the days on which there are no scintillations at the three different locations mentioned above. Further, the diurnal variation of TEC shows a rapid decay during 1700–2000 hr LT over the three different locations during scintillation days which is observed to be comparatively much less during no scintillation days. The average height of the F-layer in the post-sunset hours over Trivandrum is found to be higher, around 350 km during scintillation days while it is around 260 km during the days on which there is no scintillation activity. The average pre-reversal E&#215;B drift velocity observed around 19:00 hr LT is higher (20 m/s) during scintillation days, whereas during no scintillation days, it is found to be much less (7 m/s). Further, it is observed that the GPS receivers lose their locks whenever the S<sub>4</sub> index exceeds 0.5 (&#62;10 dB power level) and these loss of lock events are observed to be more around the anomaly crest location (Kolkata). It may be inferred from the present observations that the level of ambient ionization around noon-time, and a fast decay (collapse) of the ionization during afternoon hours followed by rapid increase in the height of the F-layer contributes significantly to the occurrence of scintillations. The present study further indicates that the S<sub>4</sub> index at L-band frequencies increases with an increase in latitude maximizing around the crest of the equatorial ionization anomaly during the post-sunset hours resulting in more loss of lock events in the GPS receiver signals around the EIA crest region.</p>

				<title>Cyclone hazard proneness of districts of India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0515-0526</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hazards associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) are long-duration rotatory high velocity winds, very heavy rain, and storm tide. India has a coastline of about 7516 km of which 5400 km is along the mainland. The entire coast is affected by cyclones with varying frequency and intensity. Thus classification of TC hazard proneness of the coastal districts is very essential for planning and preparedness aspects of management of TCs. So, an attempt has been made to classify TC hazard proneness of districts by adopting a hazard criteria based on frequency and intensity of cyclone, wind strength, probable maximum precipitation, and probable maximum storm surge. Ninety-six districts including 72 districts touching the coast and 24 districts not touching the coast, but lying within 100 km from the coast have been classified based on their proneness. Out of 96 districts, 12 are very highly prone, 41 are highly prone, 30 are moderately prone, and the remaining 13 districts are less prone. This classification of coastal districts based on hazard may be considered for all the required purposes including coastal zone management and planning. However, the vulnerability of the place has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, composite cyclone risk of a district, which is the product of hazard and vulnerability, needs to be assessed separately through a detailed study.</p>

				<title>Aquifers productivity in the Pan-African context</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0527-0539</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, 50 Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) were carried out in the region, including 14 near existing boreholes for comparison. Aquifer parameters of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity were obtained by analyzing pumping test data from existing boreholes. An empirical relationship between hydraulic conductivity (K) obtained from pumping test and both resistivity and thickness of the Pan-African aquifer has been established for these boreholes in order to calculate the geophysical hydraulic conductivity. The geoelectrical interpretation shows that almost all aquifers are made of the fractured portion of the granitic bedrock located at a depth ranging between 7 and 84 m. The hydraulic conductivity varies between 0.012 and 1.677 m/day, the resistivity between 3 and 825 𝛺m, the thickness between 1 and 101 m, the transmissivity between 0.46 and 46.02 m<sup>2</sup>/day, the product K𝜎 between 2.1 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup> and 4.2 &#215; 10<sup>−4</sup>.</p>

				<title>Assessment of the regional water balance of the limestone subaquifers of Cyprus</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0541-0551</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The northern part of Cyprus is usually characterized by its small watersheds and the lack of ephemeral surface water resources. Therefore, all the water dependent activities depend on groundwater resources. Kyrenia Range subaquifers are the only natural domestic water supplying sources, fulfilling the required worldwide drinking water quality standards. In the present study, various hydrogeological factors that could influence the aquifer recharge and abstraction are used together with annual groundwater level changes, to estimate the capacity of each subaquifer distributed at the Kyrenia Range randomly. During the analyses, 11 subaquifers are worked out; and their spatial distribution, the depth, and the daily abstraction from the available wells are surveyed. The results show that annual groundwater recharge into the subaquifers is 1126 mm. It is also observed that the subaquifers recharging from the southern foothills are more vulnerable to climate effects than the ones at the northern foothills. The available water storage at the present situation, at each subaquifer, is calculated individually and finally the total storage capacity of Kyrenia Range subaquifers, is assessed as 214 million cubic meters (MCM); whereas the data analyses show that annual abstractions from the 11 subaquifers is 13.34 MCM, annually.</p>

				<title>Observed linear trend in few surface weather elements over the Northwest Himalayas (NWH) during winter season</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0553-0565</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linear trends in few surface weather variables such as air temperatures (maximum temperature, minimum temperature), snow and rainy days, snowfall and rainfall amounts, rainfall contribution to seasonal total precipitation amount, seasonal snow cover depth and snow cover days (duration) are examined from winter-time observations at 11 stations located over the Northwest Himalayas (NWH). This study indicates that snowfall tends to show a decline in this region, while the rainfall tends to increase during the winter months. Seasonal snow cover depth and seasonal snow cover days also tend to show a decline over the NWH. Decrease in seasonal snow cover depth and duration have reduced the winter period in terms of availability of seasonal snow cover over the NWH during the last 2–3 decades. Other surface weather variables also exhibited significant temporal changes in recent decades. Observed trends in temperature and precipitation over the NWH in recent decades are also supported by long data series of temperature over the western Himalayas (WH), north mountain India (NMI) rainfall data and reanalysis products.</p>

				<title>Evolution and outburst risk analysis of moraine-dammed lakes in the central Chinese Himalaya</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0567-0576</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recent evolution and outburst risk of two typical moraine-dammed lakes, Galong and Gangxi, central Chinese Himalaya, are analyzed using topographic maps from 1974 and Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1988, 2000 and 2014. The datasets show the areas of Galong and Gangxi lakes increasing at rates of 0.45 and 0.34 km<sup>2</sup>/year during the period 1974–2014, an expansion of 501% and 107%, respectively, in the past 41 years, while the areas of the parent glaciers, Reqiang and Jipucong decreased by 44.22% and 37.76%, respectively. The accelerating retreat of the glaciers not only reflects their generally negative mass balance but is consistent with the rapid expansion of the moraine-dammed lakes. When acted upon by external forces such as earthquakes, heavy rainfall, rapid melting of glaciers and dead ice, and snow/ice/rock avalanches, these lakes can become extremely dangerous, easily forming outburst mudslides, which can potentially spread to the Poiqu river basin and develop into cross-border (China and Nepal) GLOF disasters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to strengthen integrated risk management of glacial lake outburst disasters with multiple objectives and modes.</p>

				<title>Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment of NW and central Himalayas and the adjoining region</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0577-0586</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Himalayan region has undergone significant development and to ensure safe and secure progress in such a seismically vulnerable region there is a need for hazard assessment. For seismic hazard assessment, it is important to assess the quality, consistency, and homogeneity of the seismicity data collected from different sources. In the present study, an improved magnitude conversion technique has been used to convert different magnitude scales to moment magnitude scale. The study area and its adjoining region have been divided into 22 seismogenic zones based upon the geology, tectonics, and seismicity including source mechanism relevant to the region. Region specific attenuation equations have been used for seismic hazard assessment. Standard procedure for PSHA has been adopted for this study and peak ground motion is estimated for 10% and 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years at the bed rock level. For the 10% and 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years, the PGA values vary from 0.06 to 0.36 g and 0.11 to 0.65 g, respectively considering varying 𝑏-value. Higher PGA values are observed in the southeast part region situated around Kaurik Fault System (KFS) and western parts of Nepal.</p>

				<title>Morphotectonic analysis, structural evolution/pattern of a contractional ridge: Giouchtas Mt., Central Crete, Greece</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0587-0602</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Giouchtas Mountain is situated south of Heraklion, Central Crete. It is a N–S trending morphological asymmetric ridge with a steep western slope, whilst its eastern slope is characterized by a smoother relief, composed of Mesozoic limestone and Eocene–lower Oligocene flysch of the Gavrovo–Tripolis zone. The present study focusses on the structural pattern and development of Giouchtas Mountain. Morphotectonic analyses in combination with field mapping and tectonic analysis were performed for this purpose. GIS techniques were used for mapping the spatial distribution of the geological features on the topographic relief of the area. Geomorphic indices, used in the present study, are the mountain front sinuosity index (Smf) and the valley floor/width ratio index (Vf). Based on Smf and Vf values, it is implied that this area can be assigned to a tectonic class I, corresponding to higher tectonic activity. However, spatial variations of the tectonic activity along the segmented fronts point to a general trend of increasing activity towards the north and especially, northeast. The model of this possibly active structural feature corresponds to a compressional mechanism followed by an earliest Mid. Miocene to Holocene late-stage deformation related to extensional faulting.</p>

					<p>In many geodetic analyses, it is important to consider the effect of earth tide on the instantaneous position of a station and its subsequent influence on the computation and interpretation of time series of coordinates as well as related data products. The tidal effect and temporal variations in the position of the IGS (International Global Navigational Satellite Systems [GNSS] Service) stations at Hyderabad (India), Ankara (Turkey) and Beijing Fangshan (China), due to solid earth tides has been studied. Surface tidal displacement of the station has been computed on daily basis for a month, based on the concept of gravity. Further, mean daily coordinates of the station been computed using static precise point positioning (PPP) method for a month. Results show that the station undergoes temporal displacements and its coordinates vary continuously within a day and all the days in the month. The maximum range in vertical displacement of the station has been found to be about 48 cm in a day over a period of a month and that along the north and east directions is respectively 8 cm and 14 cm. This is the maximum range but the mean value in the vertical displacement is 6 cm and along north and east is 1.7 cm and 0.09 cm, respectively. The ranges in variation in the mean value of geodetic latitude, longitude, and height of the station have been found to be 1.23, 2.73, and 3.52 cm, respectively. Further, it has been found that the tidal oscillations follow some periodicity, and thus need to be studied independently for all stations.</p>

				<title>A relook into the crustal architecture of Laxmi Ridge, northeastern Arabian Sea from geopotential data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0613-0630</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, we undertake analysis of ship-borne gravity-magnetic and satellite-derived free-air gravity (FAG) data to derive the crustal structure of Laxmi Ridge and adjacent areas. 2D and 3D crustal modelling suggests that the high resolution FAG low associated with the ridge is due to underplating and that it is of continental nature. From Energy Spectral Analysis, five-depth horizons representing interface between different layers are demarcated that match those derived from 2D models. Magnetic sources from EMAG2 data, various filtered maps and absence of underplating in the EW section suggest that the EW and NW–SE segment of the Laxmi Ridge is divided by the Girnar fracture zone and probably associated with different stages of evolution. From the derived inclination parameters, we infer that the region to the north of Laxmi Ridge, between Laxmi and Gop Basins, is composed of volcanic/basaltic flows having Deccan affinity, which might have been emplaced in an already existing crust. The calculated inclination parameters derived from the best fit 2D model suggests that the rifting in the Gop Basin preceded the emplacement of the volcanics in the region between Laxmi and Gop Basins. The emplacement of volcanic/basaltic flows may be associated with the passage of India over the Reunion hotspot.</p>

				<title>Late Cretaceous evolution of the northern Sistan suture zone, eastern Iran: Implications of magnetic fabrics and microstructures in the Bibi Maryam granitoid</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0631-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) survey supported by field and microstructural studies have been applied on the Late Cretaceous Bibi Maryam granitoid (BMG) in the northern Sistan suture zone (SSZ), east of Iran. The BMG is composed of quartzdiorite-tonalite with late granodiorite dykes and stocks that are surrounded by steeply SW-dipping Neh shear zone (NSZ). The magmatic fabrics are characterized by transpressional environment dominated by steep dipping foliations (mean strike: N13&#176;W) and sub-horizontal stretching lineations (mean trend: 167&#176;). Based on microstructural studies, it is inferred that these fabrics are related to emplacement and cooling of the pluton and the internal fabrics revealed are evidence of a deformation continuum in the granitoid from magmatic to solid state. Deformation in the region continued even after the BMG had fully crystallized, which led to development of the NW–SE foliations and lineation trend that these fabrics are subparallel with the NSZ. The BMG has emplaced in a transpressional setting that was controlled by a NW–SE stretching direction and supported the model that has proposed the relationship between granitoid emplacement and oblique intra-oceanic subduction of the Neotethys during the Late Cretaceous already recognized in this part of the SSZ.</p>

				<title>Origin of banded structure and coal lithotype cycles in Kargali coal seam of East Bokaro sub-basin, Jharkhand, India: Environmental implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0643-0654</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kargali seam of Early Permian Barakar cyclothems of East Bokaro sub-basin of Jharkhand, India is 12–30 m thick, splits into two parts, and extends throughout the length of the basin. It is made up of interbedded sequences and variable proportions of Vitrain, Clarain, Durain and Fusain. Application of embedded Markov chain model rejects the phenomenon of randomness in the repetition of coal lithotypes. The preferential upward transition path for coal lithotypes that can be derived for the Kargali top coal seam is: Vitrain $\to$ Clarain $\to$ Durain $\leftrightarrow$ Fusain $\to$ Vitrain, and for the Kargali bottom coal seam is: Clarain $\leftrightarrow$ Vitrain $\to$ Fusain $\to$ Durain $\to$ Clarain. By and large, the cyclic repetition of coal lithotypes is similar in the Kargali bottom and top seams. Among the noteworthy features are two-way transitions between Durain and Fusian in Kargali top and between Clarain and Vitrain in the case of Kargali bottom coal seam. Entropy analysis corroborates Markov chain and indicates the presence of type A-4 asymmetrical cycles of coal lithotypes.</p>
					<p>It is suggested that the banded structure of a coal seam is not a random feature and follows a definite cyclic pattern in the occurrence of coal lithotypes in vertical order and is similar to that described in Australian and European coal seams. Asymmetrical cyclic sequences are a normal, rather than an unusual condition, within coal seams. It is visualized that a gradual decline of toxic environment and ground water level resulted in the coal lithotype cycles in the Kargali seam of East Bokaro sub-basin. The close interbedding of Vitrain and Clarain is suggestive of seasonal fluctuation in anaerobic and aerobic conditions during peat formation.</p>

				<title>Numerical modelling on fate and transport of petroleum hydrocarbons in an unsaturated subsurface system for varying source scenario</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0655-0674</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The vertical transport of petroleum hydrocarbons from a surface spill through an unsaturated subsurface system is of major concern in assessing the vulnerability of groundwater contamination. A realistic representation on fate and transport of volatile organic compounds at different periods after spill is quite challenging due to the variation in the source behaviour at the surface of spill as well as the variation in the hydrodynamic parameters and the associated inter-phase partitioning coefficients within the subsurface. In the present study, a one dimensional numerical model is developed to simulate the transport of benzene in an unsaturated subsurface system considering the effect of volatilization, dissolution, adsorption and microbial degradation of benzene for (i) constant continuous source, (ii) continuous decaying source, and (iii) residual source. The numerical results suggest that volatilization is the important sink for contaminant removal considering the soil air migration within the unsaturated zone. It is also observed that the coupled effect of dissolution and volatilization is important for the decaying source at the surface immediately after the spill, whereas rate-limited dissolution from residually entrapped source is responsible for the extended contamination towards later period.</p>

				<title>Optimization method for quantitative calculation of clay minerals in soil</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0675-0680</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Determination of types and amounts for clay minerals in soil are important in environmental, agricultural, and geological investigations. Many reliable methods have been established to identify clay mineral types. However, no reliable method for quantitative analysis of clay minerals has been established so far. In this study, an attempt was made to propose an optimization method for the quantitative determination of clay minerals in soil based on bulk chemical composition data. The fundamental principles and processes of the calculation are elucidated. Some samples were used for reliability verification of the method and the results prove the simplicity and efficacy of the approach.</p>

				<title>First-order theory for Earth’s inner-core anisotropy due to super-rotation and Ramachandran interaction</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0683-0695</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solidification mechanism at the Lehmann (inner core) boundary are postulated on the basis of Ramachandran interaction by taking the fluctuating inner core super-rotation into account. The postulates are found to be consistent with compressional or P-wave velocity obtained from seismic data analysis. We justify these postulates to be physically sound and precise, and show that the fluctuating inner core super-rotation causes significant changes to the strength of Fe–Fe Ramachandran interaction, which then leads to the observed asymmetric and anisotropic inner core. Our postulates also reliably explain that the depth-dependent anisotropic P-wave attenuation close to inner core surface (to about 100 km deep) is due to phonon excitation probability and different atomic orientation. We also discuss the consistency of our postulates with respect to asymmetric inner core anisotropy (between western and eastern inner core hemispheres).</p>

				<title>Seismic link at plate boundary</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0697-0705</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seismic triggering at plate boundaries has a very complex nature that includes seismic events at varying distances. The spatial orientation of triggering cannot be reduced to sequences from the main shocks. Seismic waves propagate at all times in all directions, particularly in highly active zones. No direct evidence can be obtained regarding which earthquakes trigger the shocks. The first approach is to determine the potential linked zones where triggering may occur. The second step is to determine the causality between the events and their triggered shocks. The spatial orientation of the links between events is established from pre-ordered networks and the adapted dependence of the spatio-temporal occurrence of earthquakes. Based on a coefficient of synchronous seismic activity to grid couples, we derive a network link by each threshold. The links of high thresholds are tested using the coherence of time series to determine the causality and related orientation. The resulting link orientations at the plate boundary conditions indicate that causal triggering seems to be localized along a major fault, as a stress transfer between two major faults, and parallel to the geothermal area extension.</p>

				<title>Petrotectonic framework of granitoids and associated granulites at Nagavalli Shear Zone (NSZ), Eastern Ghats Belt: Evidence of a late transpression orogeny</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0707-0727</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Megacrystic granitoids associated with migmatitic and metasedimentary gneisses occurring around Nagavalli Shear Zone (NSZ) preserve complex metamorphic and deformation history. Thinly laminated discontinuous banding of quartzofeldspathic layer (S<sub>1</sub>) in the migmatites is the product of first incipient melting during prograde M<sub>1</sub>–D<sub>1</sub> tectonothermal event. Peak M<sub>2</sub>–D<sub>2</sub> event is manifested by the development of S<sub>2</sub> gneissic foliation in all rocks, which is axial planar to rootless folds on S<sub>1</sub>.Porphyroblastic garnet mantled by leucosomal melt fraction in granitoids, suggest that the rock suffered peak granulite facies metamorphism along with host migmatitic gneisses. The subsequent D<sub>3</sub> event deforms differently the massive granitoids and the migmatitic granulite gneisses. The D<sub>4</sub> deformation acted as transpression with broad northwest–southeast compression that develops strong discontinuous regional-scale anastomosing shear zones transecting the earlier gneissosity (S<sub>2</sub>) in the granitoids with prominent sinistral shear sense. It deforms the axial plane of regional folds in migmatites and develops superposed non-plane non-cylindrical folds in outcrop to regional scale. Thus we infer megacrystic granitoids were possibly emplaced in pre- to syn-peak metamorphic event within the host granulites. Granitoids and associated migmatitic gneisses of Late Meso- to Neoproterozoic age suffered subsequent petrotectonic events followed by a sinistral transpression acted along NSZ.</p>

				<title>Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Hüsamlar coal seam, SW Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0729-0746</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Ören and Yatağan Basins in SW Turkey host several Miocene coal deposits currently under exploitation for power generation. The present study aims to provide insight into the palaeoenvironmental conditions, which controlled the formation of the Hüsamlar coal seam located in Ören Basin. The coal seam displays many sharp alternations of matrix lignite beds and inorganic, lacustrine sediment layers. The coal is a medium-to-high ash lignite (10.47–31.16 wt%, on dry basis) with high total sulphur content (up to 10 wt%, on dry, ash-free basis), which makes it prone to self-combustion. The maceral composition indicates that the peat-forming vegetation consisted of both arboreal and herbaceous plants, with the latter being predominant in the upper part of the seam. Mica and feldspars contribute to the low part of the seam; carbonates are dominant in the upper part, whereas quartz and pyrite are present along the entire coal profile. The sudden transitions of the telmatic to the lacustrine regime and reverse is attributed to tectonic movements that controlled water table levels in the palaeomire, which affected surface runoff and hence, clastic deposition.</p>

						<li>channel margin, and overbank facies association (CMOFA), and</li>

					<p>A cyclic fining-upward trend in the succession is represented by basal quartzose conglomerate/pebbly sandstone, through coarse to fine quartzose sandstone to silt-stone and shales/claystone, which contains some carbonate accumulation. Two prominent depositional sequences are recognized in the Datta Formation with the lower high and upper low magnitude cycles. The Datta Formation thus represents a thick sedimentary succession and in the study area, i.e., western Salt Range, mainly channel belt, flood plain and/or delta top facies are exposed. The palaeocurrent analysis shows that the source area with acidic plutonic rocks laid to S–SE in the Indian shield, aravalies or older sedimentary rocks of the Indus Basin (i.e., Khewra, Tobra and Warchha formations). A tentative stratigraphic correlation of the Datta Formation with the lower Jurassic Lathi Formation, India invites further work in parts of India, which will elaborate the extent of the Datta Formation in the Greater Indian peninsula and develop palaeogeographic setting for this Lower Jurassic deltaic rock unit.</p>

				<title>Data-driven behavioural characterization of dry-season groundwater-level variation in Maharashtra, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0767-0781</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper looks at the crucial issue of dry-season groundwater-availability in the state of Maharashtra, India. We look at the two key hydro-climatological measurements which are used to implement ground-water policy in the state, viz., water levels in 5000+ observation wells across the state and aggregate rainfall data. We see that there is substantial variation in groundwater levels within and across the years in most wells. We argue that for a large number of these observation well locations, aggregate rainfall data is inadequate to model or to predict groundwater levels. For this, we use a novel random rainfall coefficient model for the purpose of modelling the effect of rainfall in a composite setting where extraction and changing land-use data is unknown. The observed high variance of this coefficient points to significant variations in groundwater levels, which may only be explained by unmeasured anthropogenic factors. Next, we see that the uncertainty in actual groundwater levels along with scarcity are two distinct features of groundwater availability and will elicit different behaviours from the typical user. Finally, we recommend that quantitative groundwater assessment protocols of the state should move to incorporating data from which extraction and land-use may be modelled. We believe this is one of the first studies where large spatio-temporal scale data gathered by state agencies have been analysed for scientific adequacy.</p>

				<title>Groundwater balance estimation and sustainability in the Sandıklı Basin (Afyonkarahisar/Turkey)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0783-0798</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Sandıklı (Afyonkarahisar) Basin is located in the southwest of Turkey and is a semi-closed basin. Groundwater is widely used for drinking, domestic and irrigation purposes in the basin. The mismanagement of groundwater resources in the basin causes negative effects including depletion of the aquifer storage and groundwater level decline. To assure sustainability of the basin, determination of groundwater budget is necessary. In this study, the water-table fluctuation (WTF) and the meteorological water budget (MWB) methods were used to estimate groundwater budget in the Sandıklı basin (Turkey). Conceptual hydrogeological model of the basin was used for understanding the relation between budget parameters. The groundwater potential of the basin calculated with MWB method as 42.10 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/year. In addition, it is also calculated with simplified WTF method as 38.48 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/year.</p>

				<title>The spatio-temporal variability of groundwater depth in a typical desert-oasis ecotone</title>

				<page>0799-0806</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eight groundwater observation wells were installed along the river plain, where the landscapes varied from floodplain, to oasis farmland, to desert-oasis ecotone to desert, in a typical desert-oasis ecotone in northwestern China. Ten years of data were used to analyze temporal and spatial changes in the ground-water depth. The results indicated that in the last decade:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the groundwater depths in the floodplain (GW1) and the desert (GW8) were basically stable;</li>
						<li>the groundwater depths in the oasis farmland (GW2, GW3, GW4) increased dramatically: the annual fluctuations were 1.43, 1.01 and 0.79 m respectively, with the groundwater depths increasing by 0.13–0.18 m every year;</li>
						<li>the groundwater depths in the desert-oasis ecotone (GW5, GW6, GW7) also increased dramatically: the annual fluctuations were 1.10, 1.06 and 1.05 m respectively, and the depths increased by 0.10–0.15 m every year;</li>
						<li>the influence distance between the river and both the farmland and the desert-oasis ecotone was about 1000–2000 m in the study area.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>These results show that the natural seasonal fluctuation influence on groundwater depths was not significant, but the human-induced fluctuations such as intensive irrigation caused a significant increase in groundwater depth in both the farmland and the desert-oasis ecotone, seriously affecting sustainable agriculture development and the environment, in the oasis.</p>

				<title>Sensitivity of annual and seasonal reference crop evapotranspiration to principal climatic variables</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0819-0828</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Reference evapotranspiration (ET<sub>0</sub>) represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and depends on climatic parameters such as radiation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Relative role of climatic parameter of ET<sub>0</sub> varies from one climate to another and within the climate, and depends on the location and time. Sensitivity analysis was conducted and sensitivity coefficients were determined to evaluate the impact of principal climatic parameters on ET<sub>0</sub> in Karnal district of India. Mean monthly ET<sub>0</sub> and yearly ET<sub>0</sub> from 1981 to 2011 were estimated from FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation using the daily climate data collected from Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal. Results showed that seasonal and annual ET<sub>0</sub> were most sensitive to maximum temperature followed by sunshine hours. However, wind speed, relative humidity, and minimum temperature had varying effect on mean ET<sub>0</sub>. After maximum temperature and sunshine hours, ET<sub>0</sub> was more sensitive to wind speed followed by relative humidity and minimum temperature in summer. In monsoon, after maximum temperature and sunshine hours, ET<sub>0</sub> was more sensitive to minimum temperature followed by relative humidity and wind speed. However, in winter, after maximum temperature and sunshine hours, ET<sub>0</sub> was more sensitive to relative humidity followed by wind speed and minimum temperature. The study suggests that the climate variability would affect reference ET<sub>0</sub>; however, its impact on ET<sub>0</sub> would be different for different parameters.</p>

				<title>Changing pattern of heavy rainstorms in the Indus basin of India under global warming scenarios</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0829-0841</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estimation of extremely high rainfall (point or areal) is one of the major components of design storm derivation. The estimation of Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) involves selection of heavy rain-storms and its maximization for the moisture content during the rainstorm period. These heavy rain-storms are nothing but the widespread heavy rainfall exceeding a certain threshold value. The present study examines the characteristics of heavy rainstorms in the Indus basin selected from present climate and future scenarios simulated by the regional climate model. Such information on heavy rainfall forms the basis for the hydrologic design projects and also for the water management of a river basin. Emphasis is given to severe rainstorms of 1-day duration covering an area of at least 40,000 km<sup>2</sup> with spatial average rainfall of at least 5cm. This analysis also provides the information on the temporal changes in the storm factors such as shape, orientation, and movement, and shows that the model can well simulate the rainstorm pattern in terms of its intensity, orientation, and shape of the rainstorm, but overestimates the frequency of such heavy rainstorms. The future scenario indicates increase in rainfall intensity at the center of the rainstorm with decreasing areal spread. Decrease in the frequency of rainstorms is projected under the global warming conditions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Ensembles of two Global Climate Models (GCMs), CGCM3 and HadCM3, are used to project future maximum temperature ($T$<sub>Max</sub>), minimum temperature ($T$<sub>Min</sub>) and precipitation in a part of Sutlej River Basin, northwestern Himalayan region, India. Large scale atmospheric variables of CGCM3 and HadCM3 under different emission scenarios and the National Centre for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research reanalysis datasets are downscaled using Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM). Variability and changes in $T$<sub>Max</sub>, $T$<sub>Min</sub> and precipitation under scenarios A1B and A2 of CGCM3 model and A2 and B2 of HadCM3 model are presented for future periods: 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. The study reveals rise in annual average $T$<sub>Max</sub>, $T$<sub>Min</sub> and precipitation under scenarios A1B and A2 for CGCM3 model as well as under A2 and B2 scenarios for HadCM3 model in 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Increase in mean monthly $T$<sub>Min</sub> is also observed for all months of the year under all scenarios of both the models. This is followed by decrease in $T$<sub>Max</sub> during June, July August and September. However, the model projects rise in precipitation in months of July, August and September under A1B and A2 scenarios of CGCM3 model and A2 and B2 of HadCM3 model for future periods.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of official tropical cyclone landfall forecast issued by India Meteorological Department</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0861-0874</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>India Meteorological Department (IMD) introduced the objective tropical cyclone (TC) track forecast valid for next 24 hrs over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) in 2003. It further extended the validity period up to 72 hrs in 2009. Here an attempt is made to evaluate the TC landfall forecast issued by IMD during 2003–2013 (11 years) by calculating the landfall point forecast error (LPE) and landfall time forecast error (LTE).</p>
					<p>The average LPE is about 67, 95, and 124 km and LTE is about 4, 7, and 2 hrs, respectively for 24, 48, and 72-hr forecasts over the NIO as a whole during 2009–2013. The accuracy of TC landfall forecast has been analysed with respect to basin of formation (Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and NIO as a whole), specific regions of landfall, season of formation (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons), intensity of TCs (cyclonic storm (CS), and severe cyclonic storm (SCS) or higher intensities) at the time of initiation of forecast and type of track of TCs (climatological/straight moving and recurving/looping type). The LPE is less over the BOB than over the AS for all forecast lengths up to 72 hrs. Similarly, the LPE is less during the post-monsoon season than during pre-monsoon season. The LPEs are less for climatologically moving/straight moving TCs than for the recurving/looping TCs.</p>
					<p>The LPE over the NIO has decreased at the rate of about 14.5 km/year during 2003–2013 for 24-hr forecasts. The LTE does not show any significant improvement for 24-hr forecast during the same period. There is significant decrease in LPE and LTE during 2009–2013 compared to 2003–2008 due to the modernisation programme of IMD. The 24-hr LPE and LTE have decreased from 157.5 to 66.5 km and 7.8 to 4.1 hrs, respectively. However, there is still scope for further reduction in 48 and 72-hr forecast errors over the NIO to about 50 and 100 km respectively based on the latest technology including aircraft reconnaissance, deployment of buoys, and assimilation of more observational data from satellite and Doppler weather radars, etc., in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models during the next five years.</p>

				<title>Performance of WRF-Chem over Indian region: Comparison with measurements</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0875-0896</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The aerosol mass concentrations over several Indian regions have been simulated using the online chemistry transport model, WRF-Chem, for two distinct seasons of 2011, representing the pre-monsoon (May) and post-monsoon (October) periods during the Indo–US joint experiment ‘Ganges Valley Aerosol Experiment (GVAX)’. The simulated values were compared with concurrent measurements. It is found that the model systematically underestimates near-surface BC mass concentrations as well as columnar Aerosol Optical Depths (AODs) from the measurements. Examining this in the light of the model-simulated meteorological parameters, we notice the model overestimates both planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and surface wind speeds, leading to deeper mixing and dispersion and hence lower surface concentrations of aerosols. Shortcoming in simulating rainfall pattern also has an impact through the scavenging effect. It also appears that the columnar AODs are influenced by the unrealistic emission scenarios in the model. Comparison with vertical profiles of BC obtained from aircraft-based measurements also shows a systematic underestimation by the model at all levels. It is seen that concentration of other aerosols, viz., dust and sea-salt are closely linked with meteorological conditions prevailing over the region. Dust is higher during pre-monsoon periods due to the prevalence of north-westerly winds that advect dust from deserts of west Asia into the Indo-Gangetic plain. Winds and rainfall influence sea-salt concentrations. Thus, the unrealistic simulation of wind and rainfall leads to model simulated dust and sea-salt also to deviate from the real values; which together with BC also causes underperformance of the model with regard to columnar AOD. It appears that for better simulations of aerosols over Indian region, the model needs an improvement in the simulation of the meteorology.</p>

				<page>0897-0908</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-interim) data of winds for the year 2007 between the pressure levels 1 and 1000 hPa (0–49 km) have been analyzed for equatorial wave activity over a tropical station Gadanki (13.5&#176;N, 79.2&#176;E). Available wind observations made by MST radar located at the same site have also been used to investigate the wave activity in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. Waves in the period bands 7–10, 12–15 and 20–30 d are observed. Temporal variability of the wave activity has been investigated by constructing wavelet spectra. The longer period waves show strong seasonal variability with maximum and minimum activities during winter and summer months respectively. Short period activity is more prominent during June–July–August in the tropospheric region. The waves are found to be generated in the troposphere by wind shear and convection. Propagation of the waves to higher altitudes is found to depend strongly on background zonal wind and phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The waves are inhibited to propagate through the negative wind shear zone. Meridional waves might be generated by non-linear wave CISK.</p>

				<title>Geomorphological evolution of badlands based on the dynamics of palaeo-channels and their implications</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0909-0920</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The badlands along the lower Chambal valley represent the worst case of water erosion in India. These badlands are believed to have developed due to neo-tectonic activities and, probably, strengthening of southwest monsoon in late Pleistocene–Holocene. Due to neo-tectonic activities, the Chambal River has undergone many changes before reaching to its present planform. This study reports palaeo-channels on the Chambal River’s right flank along its lower reaches. Salient features of the palaeo-channels and their relation to present spatial pattern of badlands are studied. These palaeo-channels have significantly influenced the development of badlands along the lower Chambal River and have given them distinct and conspicuous spatial patterns. In the light of the evidences, a modified schematic geomorphic evolution of badlands development is also proposed starting from a pre-incision scenario till the present day situation. A major modification in the proposed model is the multi-channel planform of the Chambal River before its incision.</p>

				<title>Water use efficiency of net primary production in global terrestrial ecosystems</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0921-0931</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems, which are strongly coupled via water use efficiency (WUE), are influenced by global climate change. To explore the relationship between the carbon and water cycles and predict the effect of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, it is necessary to study the WUE in global terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the 13-year WUE (i.e., net primary production (NPP)/evapotranspiration (ET)) of global terrestrial ecosystems was calculated based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) NPP (MOD17A3) and ET (MOD16A3) products from 2000 to 2012. The results indicate that the annual average WUE decreased but not significantly, and the 13-year mean value was 868.88 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>. The variation trend of WUE value for each pixel differed greatly across the terrestrial ecosystems. A significant variation (𝑃 &#60; 0.05) occurred in about 18.50% of the land surface. WUE was spatially distributed from 0 to 2541 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>, and 58.78% of the WUE values were concentrated in the interval of 600–1200 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>. The WUE increased from north to south in Africa and Oceania and from east to west in Europe and South America. Both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients existed in Asia and North America. The following trends in the WUE of different continents and Köppen–Geiger climates were observed: Europe (1129.71 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; Oceania (1084.46 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; Africa (893.51 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; South America (893.07 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; North America (870.79 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; Asia (738.98 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) and warm temperate climates (1094 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; snowy climates (862 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; arid climates (785 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; equatorial climates (732 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>) &#62; polar climates (435 mg C m<sup>−2</sup> mm<sup>−1</sup>). Based on the WUE value and the present or future rainfall, the maximum carbon that fixed in one region may be theoretically calculated. Also, under the background of global climatic change, WUE may be regarded as an important reference for allotting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions offsets and carbon transactions.</p>

				<title>Application of ANN and fuzzy logic algorithms for streamflow modelling of Savitri catchment</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0933-0943</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The streamflow prediction is an essentially important aspect of any watershed modelling. The black box models (soft computing techniques) have proven to be an efficient alternative to physical (traditional) methods for simulating streamflow and sediment yield of the catchments. The present study focusses on development of models using ANN and fuzzy logic (FL) algorithm for predicting the streamflow for catchment of Savitri River Basin. The input vector to these models were daily rainfall, mean daily evaporation, mean daily temperature and lag streamflow used. In the present study, 20 years (1992–2011) rainfall and other hydrological data were considered, of which 13 years (1992–2004) was for training and rest 7 years (2005–2011) for validation of the models. The mode performance was evaluated by R, RMSE, EV, CE, and MAD statistical parameters. It was found that, ANN model performance improved with increasing input vectors. The results with fuzzy logic models predict the streamflow with single input as rainfall better in comparison to multiple input vectors. While comparing both ANN and FL algorithms for prediction of streamflow, ANN model performance is quite superior.</p>

				<title>Water–rock interaction on the development of granite gneissic weathered profiles in Garhwal Lesser Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0945-0963</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development and sustainability of weathered profiles are very difficult in the Himalaya due to its complex lithology, tectonic history and fast erosion. Despite this, two weathered profiles namely WPa (weathered profile a) and WPb (weathered profile b) which have sustained erosion are developed on porphyry granite gneiss and granite gneissic lithology in Alaknanda valley of the Garhwal Lesser Himalaya. Systematic sampling of these two weathered profiles was done from bottom to top and they were chemically analysed to understand the elemental mobility in each profile. Major, trace and rare earth element studies show dissimilar behaviour with the advancement of weathering. In WPa profile, the CIA value of LAR (LAR) is 50 which reveals that the rock has not suffered any alteration but in WPb profile, the CIA value of LAR is 64 which indicates significant amount of chemical alteration. A–CN–K projection also exhibits similar behaviour. Further, the relative mobility of all the major and trace elements show variable elemental distribution in both the profiles. Enrichment of Mg, Fe, Ti, Al, Co, Ni, Zr, LREE and depletion of Na, K, P, Ca, Si, LILE and HFSE are observed in WPa profile; while the depletion of Na, K, Ca, P, Si, HREE and enhancement of Fe, Mn, Ti, Sc, Co, Zr, LREE are noticed in WPb profile. The rare earth elements also show a dissimilar mobilization pattern in both the profiles due to their strong dependency on lithology, and corresponding climate and tectonic interaction. Contrasting elemental mobility in both the profiles depict the major role in disparity of lithological characters and subsequent development of fractures produced by the major thrust system (Ramgarh thrust) which made an easy passage for rain water, thus causing the development of a chemically altered profile in the Lesser Himalayan region. Further, the present study infers the climate and tectonic milieu which is responsible for the development of such weathered profiles in Himalayan sector.</p>

				<title>Deciphering groundwater quality for irrigation and domestic purposes – a case study in Suri I and II blocks, Birbhum District, West Bengal, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0965-0992</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Assessment of the hydrochemical characteristics of water and aquifer hydraulic properties is important for groundwater planning and management in the study area. It is not only the basic need for human existence but also a vital input for all development activities. The present hydro-geochemical study of groundwater samples from the Suri I and II blocks of Birbhum district, West Bengal (23.76&#176;–23.99&#176;N; 87.42&#176;–87.64&#176;E) was carried out to assess their suitability for agricultural, domestic and drinking purposes. For this study, samples were collected from 26 locations during the post-monsoon and pre-monsoon sessions spanning over 2012 and 2013. Groundwater samples were analyzed for their physical and chemical properties using standard laboratory methods.</p>
					<p>Physical and chemical parameters of groundwater such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cl, HCO<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>4</sub> and F were determined. Various water quality indices like SAR, SSP, PI, RSC, MAR and KR have been calculated for each water sample to identify the irrigational suitability standard. According to most of these parameters, the groundwater has been found to be well to moderately suitable for irrigation. In the post-monsoon session exceptionally high RSC values for around 80% samples indicate an alkaline hazard to the soil. The ion balance histogram for post-monsoon indicates undesirable ion balance values according to fresh water standards whereas in pre-monsoon, the samples show good ion balance in water. For determination of the drinking suitability standard of groundwater, three parameters have been considered – total hardness (TH), Piper’s trilinear diagram and water quality index study. Groundwater of the present study area has been found to be moderately-hard to hard during both sampling sessions and hence poses no health risk which could arise due to excess consumption of calcium or magnesium. Hydrogeochemical facies in the form of Piper’s trilinear diagram plot which helps in identification of the water ‘type’ which can render a particular taste or odour to water, indicates that groundwater in the study area is majorly of CaMgHCO<sub>3</sub> and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> type (fresh type) during both post-monsoon and pre-monsoon sessions barring a couple of samples which are of CaMgSO<sub>4</sub>/CaMgClSO<sub>4</sub> type in pre-monsoon. Water quality index study reveals that close to 90% of the water samples are suitable for drinking during post-monsoon compared to pre-monsoon during which period only 60% of water samples fall under the suitable drinking water category.</p>
					<p>Gibbs’ diagrams, which help in identification of natural processes controlling hydrogeochemistry of groundwater indicates that for both post-monsoon and pre-monsoon sessions, the overall hydrogeochemistry of the study area is dominated by rock–water interaction processes.</p>

				<title>Variability in stratification and flushing times of the Gautami–Godavari estuary, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0993-1003</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In order to examine the influence of forcing (river flow and tides) and anthropogenic activities (dredging and dam regulation) on stratification, a study was conducted over a period of 19 months (June 2008–December 2009) in the Gautami–Godavari estuary (G–GE) during spring and neap tide periods covering entire spectrum of discharge over a distance of 36 km from the mouth. The bathymetry of the estuary was recently changed due to dredging of &#8764;20 km of the estuary from the mouth for transportation of barges. This significantly changed the mean depth and salinity of the estuary from its earlier state. The variations in the distribution of salinity in the Godavari estuary are driven by river discharge during wet period (June–November) and tides during dry period (December–May). The weak stratification was observed during high discharge (July–August) and no discharge (January–June) periods associated with dominant fresh water and marine water respectively. The strong stratification was developed associated with decrease in discharge during moderate discharge period (October–December). Relatively stronger stratification was noticed during neap than spring tides. The 15 psu isohaline was observed to have migrated &#8764;2–3 km more towards upper estuary during spring than neap tide suggesting more salt enters during former than latter period. Total salt content was inversely correlated with river discharge and higher salt of about 400&#215;10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> psu was observed during spring than neap tide. Flushing times varied between less than a day and more than a month during peak and no discharge periods respectively with lower times during spring than neap tide. The flushing times are controlled by river discharge during high discharge period, tides during dry period and both (river discharge and tides) under moderate discharge period. This study suggests that modification of discharge, either natural due to weak monsoon, or artificial such as dam constructions and re-routing the river flow, may have significant impact on the stratification and biogeochemistry of the Godavari estuary.</p>

				<title>Influence of nutrient input on the trophic state of a tropical brackish water lagoon</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1005-1017</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ecosystem level changes in water quality and biotic communities in coastal lagoons have been associated with intensification of anthropogenic pressures. In light of incipient changes in Asia’s largest brackish water lagoon (Chilika, India), an examination of different dissolved nutrients distribution and phytoplankton biomass, was conducted through seasonal water quality monitoring in the year 2011. The lagoon showed both spatial and temporal variation in nutrient concentration, mostly altered by fresh-water input, regulated the chlorophyll distribution as well. Dissolved inorganic N:P ratio in the lagoon showed nitrogen limitation in May and December, 2011. Chlorophyll in the lagoon varied between 3.38 and 17.66 mg m<sup>−3</sup>. Spatially, northern part of the lagoon showed higher values of DIN and chlorophyll during most part of the year, except in May, when highest DIN was recorded in the southern part. Statistical analysis revealed that dissolved NH$^{+}_{4}$–N and urea could combinedly explain 43% of Chlorophyll-𝑎 (Chl-𝑎) variability which was relatively higher than that explained by NO$^{-}_{3}$–N and NO$^{-}_{2}$–N (12.4%) in lagoon water. Trophic state index calculated for different sectors of the lagoon confirmed the inter-sectoral and inter-seasonal shift from mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions largely depending on nutrient rich freshwater input.</p>

				<title>Provenance analysis of the Oligocene turbidites (Andaman Flysch), South Andaman Island: A geochemical approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1019-1037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Oligocene-aged sandstone-shale turbidites of the Andaman Flysch are best exposed along the east coast of the South Andaman Island. Previously undocumented sandstone-shale geochemistry, investigated here, provides important geochemical constraints on turbidite provenance. The average 70.75 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 14.52 wt% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 8.2 wt% Fe<sub>2</sub>O$^{\text{t}}_{3}$+MgO and average 0.20 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> and 1.08 K<sub>2</sub>O/Na<sub>2</sub>O ratios in sandstones, compare with quartzwackes. The shale samples have average 59.63 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 20.29 wt% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 12.63 wt% Fe<sub>2</sub>O$^{\text{t}}_{3}$+MgO and average 2.42 K<sub>2</sub>O/Na<sub>2</sub>O and 0.34 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> ratios. Geochemical data on CaO–Na<sub>2</sub>O–K<sub>2</sub>O diagram fall close to a granite field and on K<sub>2</sub>O/Na<sub>2</sub>O–SiO<sub>2</sub> diagram within an active continental margin tectonic setting. The range and average values of Rb and Rb/Sr ratios are consistent with acid-intermediate igneous source rocks, while the values and ratios for Cr and Ni are with mafic rocks. Combined geochemical, petrographic and palaeocurrent data indicate a dominantly plutonic-metamorphic provenance with a lesser contribution from sedimentary and volcanic source, which is possibly the Shan–Thai continental block and volcanic arc of the north-eastern and eastern Myanmar. Chemical index of alteration (CIA) values suggests a moderate range of weathering of a moderate relief terrane under warm and humid climate.</p>

				<title>No evidence for shallow shear motion on the Mat Fault, a prominent strike slip fault in the Indo-Burmese wedge</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1039-1046</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The motion between India and Sunda plates is accommodated along the Churachandpur Mao Fault (CMF) in the Indo-Burmese Wedge (IBW) and Sagaing Fault in the Myanmar region. Within the IBW, the Mat Fault is the most prominent transverse structure with prominent topographic and geomorphic expressions. We undertook Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements across this fault to investigate the current deformation across it. Modelling of these observations using locking depth of up to 4 km yields no resolvable slip (dextral slip rate as 0&#177;5 mm/year) across the fault. Due to limited spatial extent of the GPS measurements, it is not possible to comment on the status of deeper slip, if any.</p>

				<title>An application of earthquake prediction algorithm M8 in eastern Anatolia at the approach of the 2011 Van earthquake</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1047-1062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>On 23rd October 2011, an M7.3 earthquake near the Turkish city of Van, killed more than 600 people, injured over 4000, and left about 60,000 homeless. It demolished hundreds of buildings and caused great damages to thousand others in Van, Ercis, Muradiye, and Çaldıran. The earthquake’s epicenter is located about 70 km from a preceding M7.3 earthquake that occurred in November 1976 and destroyed several villages near the Turkey–Iran border and killed thousands of people. This study, by means of retrospective application of the M8 algorithm, checks to see if the 2011 Van earthquake could have been predicted. The algorithm is based on pattern recognition of Times of Increased Probability (TIP) of a target earthquake from the transient seismic sequence at lower magnitude ranges in a Circle of Investigation (CI). Specifically, we applied a modified M8 algorithm adjusted to a rather low level of earthquake detection in the region following three different approaches to determine seismic transients. In the first approach, CI centers are distributed on intersections of morphostructural lineaments recognized as prone to magnitude 7+ earthquakes. In the second approach, centers of CIs are distributed on local extremes of the seismic density distribution, and in the third approach, CI centers were distributed uniformly on the nodes of a 1&#176;&#215;1&#176; grid. According to the results of the M8 algorithm application, the 2011 Van earthquake could have been predicted in any of the three approaches. We noted that it is possible to consider the intersection of TIPs instead of their union to improve the certainty of the prediction results. Our study confirms the applicability of a modified version of the M8 algorithm for predicting earthquakes at the Iranian–Turkish plateau, as well as for mitigation of damages in seismic events in which pattern recognition algorithms may play an important role.</p>

				<title>Organic richness and gas generation potential of Permian Barren Measures from Raniganj field, West Bengal, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1063-1074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The organic geochemistry of shales in terms of its organic richness, hydrocarbon source potential, thermal maturity, depositional environment, etc., are essential stipulations for shale gas resources assessment. In this study, a total of 32 core samples of Permian Barren Measures from four boreholes in Raniganj field of Damodar Basin were analysed to evaluate their gas generation potential using Rock–Eval pyrolysis techniques. Petrographic analysis brings out the lithofacies of Barren Measures as carbonaceous silty shale, iron rich claystone and sand-shale intercalation. The total organic content (TOC) of the shale units of Barren Measures ranges from 3.75 to 20.9 wt%, whereas hydrogen index (HI) ranges from 58.45 to 125.34 mg HC/g TOC. Present study suggests early to late maturated (0.6–1%) organic matters in Barren Measures with gas prone type III kerogen. The study analysed the effect of burial history on the preservation and maturation of organic matters. The organic richness, kerogen type, thermal maturity and petrographic properties of Barren Measures signify fair to excellent gas generation potential.</p>

				<title>ArcGIS studies and field relationships of Paleoproterozoic mafic dyke swarms from the south of Devarakonda area, Eastern Dharwar Craton, southern India: Implications for their relative ages</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1075-1084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Google Earth Image and cross-cutting field relationships of distinct Paleoproterozoic mafic dykes from south of Devarakonda area in the Eastern Dharwar Craton has been studied to establish relative emplacement ages. The Devarakonda, covering an area of &#8764;700 km<sup>2</sup>, shows spectacular cross-cutting field relationships between different generations of mafic dykes, and is therefore selected for the present study. Although some recent radiometric age data are available for distinct Paleoproterozoic mafic dykes from the Eastern Dharwar Craton, there is no analogous age data available for the study area. Therefore, relative age relationships of distinct mafic dykes have been established for the study area using cross-cutting field relationships and GIS techniques, which shows slightly different picture than other parts of the Eastern Dharwar Craton. It is suggested that NE–SW trending mafic dykes are youngest in age (probably belong to &#8764;1.89 Ga dyke swarm), whereas NNW–SSE trending mafic dykes have oldest emplacement age. Further, the NNW–SSE mafic dykes are older to the other two identified mafic dyke swarms, i.e., WNW–ESE (&#8764;2.18 Ga) and N–S trending (&#8764;2.21 Ga) mafic dyke swarms, as dykes of these two swarms cross-cut a NNW–SSE dyke. It provides an evidence for existence of a new set of mafic dykes that is older to the &#8764;2.21 Ga and probably younger to the &#8764;2.37 Ga swarm. Present study also supports existence of two mafic dyke swarms having similar trend (ENE–WSW to NE–SW) but emplaced in two different ages (one is &#8764;2.37 Ga and other &#8764;1.89 Ga).</p>

				<title>Attribute of trace fossils of Laisong flysch sediments, Manipur, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1085-1113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The depositional basin in which the Late Eocene–Early Oligocene Laisong flysch sediments Barail Group, Manipur region (Indo-Myanmar ranges) have been deposited is generally considered to be of deep marine environment. However, field observation indicates the presence of many shallow environment signature characteristics of marginal to sublittoral marine settings, in addition to the general occurrence of deep marine turbidites. To address this aspect, ichnological analyses of the Laisong Formation has been attempted for elucidating palaeoenvironmental setting prevalent during the deposition of these sediments. Presence of 36 ichnospecies belonging to 33 ichnogenera has so far been identified. The ichnospecies may be grouped into different ichnofacies such as <i>Skolithos–Cruziana</i> mixed ichnofacies, <i>Cruziana</i> ichnofacies, <i>Skolithos</i> ichnofacies, <i>Zoophycos</i> ichnofacies, <i>Nereites</i> ichnofacies and <i>Teredolites</i> ichnofacies which decrease in abundance in this order of sequence with <i>Skolithos–Cruziana</i> mixed ichnofacies being the most dominant. The above-mentioned ichnofacies are found associated with sedimentary structures such as large sole marks, parallel laminations, massive and structureless beds, rip-up clasts, etc., which are characteristics of submarine fan deposits below the storm wave base and current ripples, herringbone structures, hummocky cross stratifications, pot casts, rain prints, etc., that marked shallow marginal marine setting such as tidal flats, deltas and shoreface. With such observations it is very likely that the Laisong sediments were formed in a tectonically active basin with varied bathymetric ranges indicating alternate transgressive and regressive nature.</p>

				<title>Effects of geomagnetic storm on low latitude ionospheric total electron content: A case study from Indian sector</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1115-1126</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of geomagnetic storms on low latitude ionosphere has been investigated with the help of Global Positioning System Total Electron Content (GPS-TEC) data. The investigation has been done with the aid of TEC data from the Indian equatorial region, Port Blair (PBR) and equatorial ionization anomaly region, Agartala (AGR). During the geomagnetic storms on 24th April and 15th July 2012, significant enhancement up to 150% and depression up to 72% in VTEC is observed in comparison to the normal day variation. The variations in VTEC observed from equatorial to EIA latitudes during the storm period have been explained with the help of electro-dynamic effects (prompt penetration electric field (PPEF) and disturbance dynamo electric field (DDEF)) as well as mechanical effects (storm-induced equatorward neutral wind effect and thermospheric composition changes). The current study points to the fact that the electro-dynamic effect of geomagnetic storms around EIA region is more effective than at the lower latitude region. Drastic difference has been observed over equatorial region (positive storm impact) and EIA region (negative storm impact) around same longitude sector, during storm period on 24th April. This drastic change as observed in GPS-TEC on 24th April has been further confirmed by using the O/N<sub>2</sub> ratio data from GUVI (Global Ultraviolet Imager) as well as VTEC map constructed from IGS data. The results presented in the paper are important for the application of satellite-based communication and navigational system.</p>

				<title>Dust storm detection using random forests and physical-based approaches over the Middle East</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1127-1141</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dust storms are important phenomena over large regions of the arid and semi-arid areas of the Middle East. Due to the influences of dust aerosols on climate and human daily activities, dust detection plays a crucial role in environmental and climatic studies. Detection of dust storms is critical to accurately understand dust, their properties and distribution. Currently, remotely sensed data such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) with appropriate temporal and spectral resolutions have been widely used for this purpose. This paper investigates the capability of two physical-based methods, and random forests (RF) classifier, for the first time, to detect dust storms using MODIS imagery. Since the physical-based approaches are empirical, they suffer from certain drawbacks such as high variability of thresholds depending on the underlying surface. Therefore, classification-based approaches could be deployed as an alternative. In this paper, the most relevant bands are chosen based on the physical effects of the major classes, particularly dust, cloud and snow, on both emissive infrared and reflective bands. In order to verify the capability of the methods, OMAERUV AAOD (aerosol absorption optical depth) product from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) sensor is exploited. In addition, some small regions are selected manually to be considered as ground truth for measuring the probability of false detection (POFD) and probability of missing detection (POMD). The dust class generated by RF is consistent qualitatively with the location and extent of dust observed in OMERAUV and MODIS true colour images. Quantitatively, the dust classes generated for eight dust outbreaks in the Middle East are found to be accurate from 7% and 6% of POFD and POMD respectively. Moreover, results demonstrate the sound capability of RF in classifying dust plumes over both water and land simultaneously. The performance of the physical-based approaches is found weaker than RF due to empirical thresholds that are not always true.</p>

				<title>Geomorphological features of active tectonics and ongoing seismicity of northeastern Kumaun Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1143-1157</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The northeastern part of Kumaun Lesser Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India, lying between the rupture zones of 1905, Kangra and 1934, Bihar–Nepal earthquakes and known as ‘central seismic gap’ is a segment of an active fault known to produce significant earthquakes and has not slipped in an unusually long time when compared to other segments. The studied section forms a part of this seismic gap and is seismically an active segment of the Himalayan arc, as compared to the remaining part of the Kumaun Lesser Himalaya and it is evident by active geomorphological features and seismicity data. The geomorphological features of various river valley transects suggest that the region had a history of tectonic rejuvenation which is testified by the deposition of various levels of terraces and their relative uplift, shifting and ponding of river channels, uplifted potholes, triangular facets on fault planes, fault scarps, etc. Further, the seismic data of five-station digital telemetered seismic network along with two stand alone systems show the distribution of earthquakes in or along the analyzed fault transects. It is observed that the microseismic earthquakes (magnitude 1.0–3.0) frequently occur in the region and hypocenters of these earthquakes are confined to shallow depths (10–20 km), with low stress drop values (1.0–10 bar) and higher peak ground velocity (PGV). The cluster of events is observed in the region, sandwiched between the Berinag Thrust (BT) in south and Main Central Thrust (MCT) in north. The occurrences of shallow focus earthquakes and the surface deformational features in the different river valley transect indicates that the region is undergoing neotectonic rejuvenation. In absence of chronology of the deposits it is difficult to relate it with extant seismicity, but from the geomorphic and seismic observations it may be concluded that the region is still tectonically active. The information would be very important in identifying the areas of hazard prone and also planning and designing of the socio-economic projects.</p>

				<title>Seismic properties of naturally deformed quartzites of the Alaknanda valley, Garhwal Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1159-1175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present contribution summarizes the results of a study focusing on the influence of quartz microstructures on the seismic wave velocities in the quartzites of the Garhwal Himalaya. Quartzites being monomineralic were chosen for the present study so as to nullify the effect of other mineral constituents on the seismic velocity. Samples were collected from different tectonic settings of the Higher and Lesser Himalayas which are separated from one another by the major tectonic zone ‘Main Central Thrust’ (MCT). These are mainly Pandukeshwar quartzite, Tapovan quartzite and Berinag quartzite. The samples of Berinag quartzite were collected from near the klippen and the thrust, termed as Alaknanda Thrust. The vast differences in microstructures and associated seismic wave velocities have been noted in different quartzites. It has also been observed that quartzites of the MCT zone and Alaknanda Thrust have higher seismic velocities. This is because of their coarse-grained nature of the rocks as evidenced by the strong positive relation between seismic velocities and grain area. The coarsening is either due to the operation of grain boundary migration and grain area reduction process or high aspect ratio/shape preferred orientation. The quartzites located around Nandprayag Klippen have undergone static recrystallization and exhibit the lowest seismic wave velocities.</p>

				<title>Magnetic polarity stratigraphy of the Siwalik sequence in Nurpur area, NW Himalaya, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1177-1185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Magnetic polarity stratigraphy studies were carried out on Jabbar Khad section of Nurpur area, Kangra District, Himachal Pradesh, India. Oriented block samples were collected at 202 sites with 3–5 samples per site from a 2350-m thick continuous sedimentary sequence consisting of sandstone–mudstone alternating beds. Specimens were subjected to thermal demagnetization (100–700&#176;C) after measuring their natural remanent magnetization (NRM). Palaeolatitudes of virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) from each site were calculated from the acquired characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions. The observed remanence carrier could be haematite. Magnetic polarity scale (MPS) was erected. This MPS is correlated with the standard geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) of Lourens <i>et al.</i> (2004). The MPS readily matched from chron C2An.1n to chron C4n.2n, therefore assigning an age 8.20–2.60 Ma to the middle and upper Siwalik sections at Nurpur. The rate of sedimentation in middle Siwalik is 29 mm/yr and upper Siwalik is 59 mm/yr.</p>

				<title>Garnet-sillimanite bearing gneisses from Darjeeling, eastern Himalaya: Textural relationship and P–T conditions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1187-1199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The area around Darjeeling consists of medium grade metamorphic rocks and provides a classic example of inverted Himalayan metamorphism. The area under investigation shows upper amphibolite facies metamorphism (sillimanite-muscovite subfacies), rocks are intimately associated with the migmatites and granites. The presence of quartzite, calc-silicate rocks, graphitic schist and abundance of aluminous minerals like kyanite or sillimanite in these rocks indicate their metasedimentary character. Granetsillimanite bearing gneisses occupy most of the area of Darjeeling but not persistent throughout. Textural relationship suggests sequential growth of progressively higher-grade metamorphic minerals during D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> deformation. The relative X<sub>Mg</sub> in the minerals varies in the order: biotite&#62;staurolite&#62;garnet, and the X<sub>Mn</sub> decreases in the order: garnet&#62;staurolite&#62;biotite. The P–T evolution of these garnetsillimanite gneiss has been constrained through the use of conventional geothermobarometry, internally consistent TWEEQU programme and Perple_X software in the KFMASH model system, the combination of these three approaches demonstrates that the Darjeeling gneisses experienced peak pressure and temperature at 7.0 &#177; 0.3 kbar and 700 &#177; 30&#176;C. The observation in this study has important bearing on the inverted metamorphism in the Himalayan metamorphic belt.</p>

The new rodents exhibit morphological features most similar to the unified ctenodactyloid family Chapattimyidae (including Yuomyidae), which is also represented in the assemblage from the upper part (middle Eocene) of the Subathu Formation. The associated lower cheek teeth are provisionally described as three indeterminate chapattimyid taxa. The new Subathu rodents are somewhat younger than the previously documented early Eocene assemblages from the Indian subcontinent, and are chronologically intermediate between the early Eocene ailuravines from Gujarat in the western peninsular India and the middle Eocene chapattimyids from northwestern India and Pakistan. They suggest that chapattimyids originated in the sub-Himalayan region during the Ypresian, which is earlier than previously believed. The absence of ailuravines in this as well as younger rodent assemblages from the subcontinent seems to suggest that ailuravines (Ischyromyidae), within a relatively short time after their appearance in the peninsular India in the early Eocene, may have been replaced by the indigenous chapattimyids. The co-occurrence in the early Eocene Subathu assemblage of three or more chapattimyids indicates their early radiation and dominance during the early and middle Eocene. This record of rodents opens the possibility of recovery of other small mammal remains in older levels of the Subathu Formation, which will be important for understanding linkage with early Eocene faunas from peninsular India, Europe and North America.</p>

				<title><i>In situ</i> gamma radiation measurements in the Neoproterozoic rocks of Sirohi region, NW India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1223-1234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Natural gamma ray measurements using a portable device were performed at 157 sites in the area around Sirohi town and Sindreth village in Rajasthan (NW India). This region comprises sedimentary rocks, metasediments, granites and gneisses that bear characteristic GR dose values and U/Th ratios corresponding with their specific geological history. A-type Malani granites and rhyolitic derivates, also referred as high heat production granites, show distinct differences as compared to the S-type Erinpura and Balda granites, most prominent in a high Th content of the former (up to 90 ppm). Sedimentary rocks in the Sirohi and Sindreth area are variable in their signatures reflecting their variable source rocks. In the area between the Balda and Paladi villages, northeast of Sirohi, measurements in vicinity of a N–S running shear zone, have shown U enrichment up to 8 ppm. This shear zone has been synkinematically mineralized with quartz and shows evidence of fluid infiltration into the host rocks in the vicinity of the shear zone. Erinpura granites have been altered due to fluid activity and show a light depletion of K (3.96%) and Th (20.11 ppm) as compared to the unaltered rocks (K, 4.06; Th 24.46 ppm). Enrichment of U (with a mean value of 13 ppm) has also been recorded in the lower clastic unit of the Sindreth Basin, especially within gritty conglomerates wherein migration and precipitation along fault planes is proposed.</p>

				<title>Comparison of various isostatic marine gravity disturbances</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1235-1245</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present and compare four types of the isostatic gravity disturbances compiled at sea level over the world oceans and marginal seas. These isostatic gravity disturbances are computed by applying the Airy–Heiskanen (AH), Pratt–Hayford (PH) and Vening Meinesz–Moritz (VMM) isostatic models. In addition, we compute the complete crust-stripped (CCS) isostatic gravity disturbances which are defined based on a principle of minimizing their spatial correlation with the Moho geometry. We demonstrate that each applied compensation scheme yields a distinctive spatial pattern in the resulting isostatic marine gravity field. The AH isostatic gravity disturbances provide the smoothest gravity field (by means of their standard deviation). The AH and VMM isostatic gravity disturbances have very similar spatial patterns due to the fact that the same isostatic principle is applied in both these definitions expect for assuming a local (in the former) instead of a global (in the latter) compensation mechanism. The PH isostatic gravity disturbances are highly spatially correlated with the ocean-floor relief. The CCS isostatic gravity disturbances reveal a signature of the ocean-floor spreading characterized by an increasing density of the oceanic lithosphere with age.</p>

				<title>Assessment of some homogeneous methods for the regional analysis of suspended sediment yield in the south and southeast of the Caspian Sea</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1247-1263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Regional analysis of suspended sediment yield (SSY) is commonly used to estimate sediment at a particular site where little or no information is available on sediment yield. In this research, the efficiency of three input selection and homogenization methods were evaluated in the estimation of SSY. Therefore, 42 sediment measurement stations and their upstream watersheds were selected and sediment rating curve was estimated by using regression models for each station. Mean annual SSY was estimated by using sediment rating curve and daily discharge. In the present study, in order to determine the independent variables in sediment yield, 11 physiographical, one climatic and two hydrologic variables of whole study watersheds were selected. Then the most effective independent variables were selected by using principal component analysis (PCA), Gamma test (GT) and stepwise regression (SR) techniques. After reducing 14 input variables to five (using PCA and GT) and two (using SR techniques), they are divided into homogeneous areas by Andrew curve (AC), cluster analysis (CA) and canonical discriminate function (CDFs) techniques. The watersheds were divided into two (using PCA-AC), three (using PCA-CA, PCA-CDFs and GT-CDFs), four (using GT-CA, GT-AC and SR-CA) and five (using SR-AC) homogenous regions. Multiple regression models to estimate mean annual SSY as a function of five (using PCA and GT) and two (using SR techniques) watershed characteristics were built in each homogeneous region, and compared to actual mean annual SSY in each station using relative error (RE), efficiency coefficients (CE) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE). The results showed that preprocessing the input variables by means of PCA and GT techniques has improved the homogeneous stations determination and the development models. According to the results, the best technique for determining homogeneous watersheds was AC technique with RE=49.24%, RRMSE=43.75% and CE=71.04%.</p>

				<title>Fate and source distribution of organic constituents in a river-dominated tropical estuary</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1265-1279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated spatial and temporal changes in the quality of sedimentary organic matter and trophic status of the Cochin estuarine system, southwest coast of India. Sediment samples were collected in five sampling campaigns from January 2009 to April 2010. TOC/N ratio implied mixed input of autochthonous as well as remarkable allochthonous terrestrial higher plant debris into the sedimentary system. More depleted $\delta^{13}$C values at riverine and industrial zone suggested a major contribution of terrestrial higher plant debris to sedimentary organic matter. Trophic status of the estuary changed seasonally to eutrophic via oligotrophic and mesotrophic conditions during the period January 2009 to April 2010. The protein to carbohydrate ratio was lower (&#60;1), indicating heterotrophic nature and the higher lipid to carbohydrate ratio (&#62;1) denoted preservation of lipid compounds in the sediments. Correlation analyses provide evidence of the association of chlorophyll pigments with carbohydrates and account for the highly productive nature of the estuary and algal contributions to organic matter. Canonical correspondence analysis clearly illustrated prominence of phaeopigments in fishing zone, lipids in sewage/tourism influenced zone, carbohydrates in riverine zone and proteins in industrial zone. It also indicated the influence of sedimentary texture, pH and organic carbon to the distribution of biochemical constituents.</p>

				<title>Geochemical and isotopic signatures for the identification of seawater intrusion in an alluvial aquifer</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1281-1291</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seawater intrusion is one of the alarming processes that reduces the water quality and imperils the supply of freshwater in coastal aquifers. The region, north of the Chennai city, India is one such site affected by seawater intrusion. The objective of this study is to identify the extent of seawater intruded area by major geochemical and isotopic signatures. A total of 102 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for major and minor ions. Groundwater samples with electrical conductivity (EC) greater than 5000 𝜇S/cm and a river mouth sample were analyzed for Oxygen-18 (𝛿<sup>18</sup>O) and Deuterium (𝛿<sup>2</sup>H) isotopes to study their importance in monitoring seawater intrusion. The molar ratio of geochemical indicators and isotopic signatures suggests an intrusion up to a distance of 13 km from the sea as on March 2012 and up to 14.7 km during May 2012.</p>

				<title>Major ion chemistry of the Son River, India: Weathering processes, dissolved fluxes and water quality assessment</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1293-1309</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>River Son, draining diverse lithologies in the subtropical climate of the peninsular sub-basin of the Ganga basin, is one of the major tributaries of the Ganga River. The chemistry of major ions in the surface water of the Son River was studied in detail to determine various source(s) and processes controlling its water chemistry, seasonal and spatial variations in water chemistry, dissolved fluxes and chemical denudation rate (CDR). The study shows that Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and HCO$^{-}_{3}$ are major ionic species in the river water. Most of the measured parameters exhibit a relatively lower concentration in the post-monsoon as compared to pre-monsoon season. The water chemistry highlights the influence of continental weathering aided by secondary contributions from ground water, saline/alkaline soils and anthropogenic activities in the catchment. Results also reflect the dominance of carbonate weathering over silicate weathering in controlling water composition. The Son River delivers about 4.2 million tons of dissolved loads annually to the Ganga River, which accounts for $\sim$6% of the total annual load carried by the Ganga River to the Bay of Bengal. The average CDR of the Son River is 59.5 tons km<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, which is less than the reported 72 tons km<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> of the Ganga River and higher than the global average of 36 tons km<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>. The water chemistry for the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods shows a strong seasonal control on solute flux and CDR values. The water chemistry indicates that the Son River water is good to excellent in quality for irrigation and also suitable for drinking purposes.</p>

				<title>Assessment and mapping of flood potential in the Slănic catchment in Romania</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1311-1324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Flood risk assessment is an important component of risk management. Given this context, this paper aims to identify and map areas with high potential for flash-floods and flooding occurrence, at different spatial scales (from catchment to local scale), in order to estimate the flood/flooding vulnerability. The paper is based on three main methods, which were applied in the Slănic River catchment (427 km<sup>2</sup>), located in the external curvature region of the Romanian Carpathians: (i) statistical analyses; (ii) determination and mapping of some indices to assess the flash-flood and flooding potential (FFPI and respectively FPI) and (iii) hydraulic modelling. The data used mainly include hydrological statistics (maximum monthly and annual discharges, flood-related data) and spatial data on catchment geographical characteristics (hypsometry, geology, soils, land use) obtained or derived from various sources (maps, aerial images, digital databases, field measurements) which were integrated into the GIS environment. The aforementioned methods helped to (i) highlight specificities of floods in the Slănic catchment (magnitude, frequency, flood waves characteristics); (ii) identify areas with high potential for flash-floods and flooding at the catchment spatial scale; (iii) assess the structural vulnerability in the Cernăteşti village, by simulating flood-prone areas for flood peaks with exceedance probability of 1%, 5% and 10%. The results could lead to a better knowledge and understanding of flood characteristics in the study area, in order to mitigate the flood risk through a more effective management, both at the catchment scale, as well as local scale (in the Cernătești village).</p>

				<title>Multilayer perceptron neural network for downscaling rainfall in arid region: A case study of Baluchistan, Pakistan</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1325-1341</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Downscaling rainfall in an arid region is much challenging compared to wet region due to erratic and infrequent behaviour of rainfall in the arid region. The complexity is further aggregated due to scarcity of data in such regions. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network has been proposed in the present study for the downscaling of rainfall in the data scarce arid region of Baluchistan province of Pakistan, which is considered as one of the most vulnerable areas of Pakistan to climate change. The National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis datasets from 20 grid points surrounding the study area were used to select the predictors using principal component analysis. Monthly rainfall data for the time periods 1961–1990 and 1991–2001 were used for the calibration and validation of the MLP model, respectively. The performance of the model was assessed using various statistics including mean, variance, quartiles, root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Comparisons of mean monthly time series of observed and downscaled rainfall showed good agreement during both calibration and validation periods, while the downscaling model was found to underpredict rainfall variance in both periods. Other statistical parameters also revealed good agreement between observed and downscaled rainfall during both calibration and validation periods in most of the stations.</p>

				<title>Analysis of the accuracy of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) height models using International Global Navigation Satellite System Service (IGS) Network</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1343-1357</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) carried out in February 2000 has provided near global topographic data that has been widely used in many fields of earth sciences. The mission goal of an absolute vertical accuracy within 16 m (with 90% confidence)/RMSE $\sim$10 m was achieved based on ground validation of SRTM data through various studies using global positioning system (GPS). We present a new and independent assessment of the vertical accuracy of both the X- and C-band SRTM datasets using data from the International GNSS Service (IGS) network of high-precision static GPS stations. These stations exist worldwide, have better spatial distribution than previous studies, have a vertical accuracy of 6 mm and constitute the most accurate ground control points (GCPs) possible on earth; these stations are used as fiducial stations to define the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). Globally, for outlier-filtered data (135 X-band stations and 290 C-band stations), the error or difference between IGS and SRTM heights exhibits a non-normal distribution with a mean and standard error of 8.2 &#177; 0.7 and 6.9 &#177; 0.5 m for X- and C-band data, respectively. Continent-wise, Africa, Australia and North America comply with the SRTM mission absolute vertical accuracy of 16 m (with 90% confidence)/RMSE $\sim$10 m. However, Asia, Europe and South America have vertical errors higher than the SRTM mission goal. At stations where both the X- and C-band SRTM data were present, the root mean square error (RMSE) of both the X- and C-bands was identical at 11.5 m, indicating similar quality of both the X- and C-band SRTM data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The study aims at detection, mapping and monitoring of land subsidence in Jharia Coalfield, Jharkhand, India by spaceborne DInSAR, GPS and precision levelling techniques. Using multi-frequency C- and L-band DInSAR, both slowly and rapidly subsiding areas were identified and DInSAR-based subsidence maps were prepared. C-band DInSAR was found useful for detection of slowly subsiding areas whereas L-band DInSAR for rapidly subsiding and/or adverse land cover areas. Due to dynamic nature of mining and adverse land cover, temporal decorrelation poses a serious problem particularly in C-band DInSAR. Specially designed InSAR coherence guided adaptive filtering was found useful to highlight the deformation fringes. Collateral GPS and levelling observations were conducted in three test sites to validate DInSAR measurements and to determine the net displacement vectors. We observed an appreciable horizontal displacement component of land subsidence in all the test sites. For comparison of results, we calculated InSAR coherence weighted LOS displacement rates from the unwrapped differential interferograms of smaller spatial subsets and LOS projected ground-based displacement rates in three test sites. We found good agreement between DInSAR and ground-based measurements except for C-band observation in Dobari test site primarily due to large difference in observation periods and temporally inconsistent land subsidence. Collateral spaceborne and ground-based observations were also found useful for characterization of subsidence phenomena to determine net displacement vector and horizontal displacement component. In coal mining areas with spatially scattered and temporally irregular land subsidence phenomena, the adopted methodology can be used successfully for detection, mapping and monitoring of the subsiding areas vulnerable to future collapse. This will facilitate efficient planning and designing of surface infrastructures and other developmental structures in the mining areas and mitigation management of subsidence induced hazards.</p>

				<title>Regional biomass burning trends in India: Analysis of satellite fire data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1377-1387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The results based on the analysis of satellite fire counts detected by the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) sensors over different regions of India during 1998–2009 have been presented. Generally, the activities of open biomass burning show large spatial and temporal variations in India. The highest and lowest values of monthly fire counts were detected during the periods of March–May and July–September, respectively over different regions of India. The activities of biomass burning in two central states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were the highest and together accounted for about 25–45% of total annual fire counts detected over India during the study period. However, in opposite phases, the rainfall and fire count data show strong seasonal variation. In addition to large regional and seasonal variations, the fire data also show significant year-to-year variation. The higher annual fire counts exceeding the mean of entire period by about 16% and 43% were detected during the two periods of 1998–2000 and 2007–2009, respectively. We have estimated normalized anomaly of annual fire count data which shows large positive departures from long-term mean for the years 1999, 2007, 2008 and 2009, while negative departures for the years 2002, 2003 and 2005. Consistently, the mixing ratio of carbon monoxide (CO) typical peaks during winter but extended to pre-monsoon season during extensive fire years. The annual data over the entire region of India show lesser positive trend of about 3% yr<sup>−1</sup>. The inter-annual variation of fire count over entire India follows the trend in the ENSO Precipitation Index (ESPI) but shows opposite trend to the multivariate ENSO Index (MEI).</p>

				<title>Space-based long-term observation of shrinking grassland habitat: A case-study from central India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1389-1398</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Grassland ecosystem is critical for survival of herbivores and plays an important role in conservation and management of wildlife. These habitats are widely studied for various issues, including biodiversity, biomass assessment, carrying capacity, etc. Woody species ingression in grasslands is one such important aspect that needs critical attention in protected area as this leads to shrinking of grasslands habitat. This study presents a case of Ronda grassland in Kanha National Park – a well-known protected area in India, known for its herbivore diversity and hard-ground Barasingha (Rucervus duvaceli branderi), in particular. Long-term satellite observation for five decades was carried out to understand spatio-temporal changes. Declassified Corona satellite data, aerial photographs along with satellite datasets in the subsequent period were utilised for this study. The study revealed that 88 ha (16% of Ronda and surrounding) have been ingressed during 1962–2011, in and around Ronda grassland of Kanha National Park. Rates of ingression on linear transects were found to be 60–120 m per decade. Field studies and NDVI analysis along the edge of grassland pixels as well as inside region using 1972 as baseline data, indicated woody vegetation replacing area of grassland. It was noted that Butea monosperma is invading more than other species in Ronda grassland, particularly along the stream where moisture availability is higher. Grassland habitats in Kanha are thus shrinking and thus leading to reduction in the area available for herbivore population which has increased in recent years. This can lead to severe impact on carrying capacity of these grasslands.</p>

				<title>GIS-based assessment of landslide susceptibility using certainty factor and index of entropy models for the Qianyang County of Baoji city, China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1399-1415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The main goal of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility maps for the Qianyang County of Baoji city, China, using both certainty factor (CF) and index of entropy (IOE) models. At first, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier reports and aerial photographs as well as by carrying out field surveys. A total of 81 landslide locations were detected. Out of these, 56 (70%) landslides were randomly selected as training data for building landslide susceptibility models and the remaining 25 (30%) were used for the validation purposes. Then, a total number of 15 landslide causative factors, such as slope angle, slope aspect, general curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, the sediment transport index (STI), the stream power index (SPI), the topographic wetness index (TWI), geomorphology, lithology, and rainfall, were used in the analysis. The susceptibility maps produced using CF and IOE models had five different susceptibility classes such as very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. Finally, the output maps were validated using the validation data (i.e., 30% landslide location data that was not used during the model construction), using the area under the curve (AUC) method. The `success rate' curve showed that the area under the curve for CF and IOE models were 0.8433 (84.33%) and 0.8227 (82.27%) accuracy, respectively. Similarly, the validation result showed that the susceptibility map using CF model has the higher prediction accuracy of 82.32%, while for IOE model it was 80.88%. The results of this study showed that the two landslide susceptibility maps obtained were successful and can be used for preliminary land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.</p>

				<page>1417-1428</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Microtremor survey is achieved in order to evaluate the dynamical characteristics of surface layers. For this purpose, 13 trenches were selected and microtremor measurements were performed at the top and bottom of each trench. Floor spectral ratio (FRS) analysis was accomplished to obtain frequency and amplification of the trenches. The results of microtremor were compared with 1D equivalent linear analysis. Most of the fundamental frequencies obtained by 1D analysis are in good agreement with those calculated by microtremor technique. Irregularities in surface and subsurface geomorphic conditions tend to have differences in results obtained by both mentioned methods. Damping ratios were derived from the half power bandwidth method. The damping ratio varied between 2.1 in fine grain soils and 6.6 in sand soils.</p>

				<title>Determining the site effects of 23 October 2011 earthquake (Van province, Turkey) on the rural areas using HVSR microtremor method</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1429-1443</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A magnitude of 7.1 Mw earthquake struck Van city on October 23, 2011. Although, construction practices of all rural housing units are similar in the region, the earthquake caused massive damage to villages located on soft soils in northern region of the city. In this study, the effects of soil conditions on damaged housing units were determined by conducting horizontal to vertical spectral ratios of microtremor (HVSR) measurements. The level of damage in the villages that are settled on lacustrine and stream sediments has verified that the damage correlates well with comparatively high HVSR peak period and HVSR peak amplitude values in the range of 0.2–1.6 s and 4–10, respectively. The HVSR peak period and HVSR peak amplitude levels on rock units are in the range of 0.1–0.2 s and 1.5–2, respectively. It is important to note that hillside effect is found to be another key factor that increased the level of damage to the housing units in some villages.</p>

				<page>1445-1456</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The seismotectonic structure of north Pakistan has been formed by ongoing collision between the Eurasian and Indian plates. North Pakistan and the adjoining areas experienced many large earthquakes in the past, which resulted in considerable damages and loss of life. A magnitude-homogenous earth-quake catalogue for north Pakistan and its surrounding areas for the instrumental period from 1964 to 2007 is used for analysis. We presented seismicity picture of the Hindukush–Pamir–Karakoram (HPK), Kohistan Island Arc (KIA) and Hazara–Kashmir–Himalayas (HKH) using various histograms and time series plots of the dataset. The b-value for each accreted domain is derived separately and investigated through a process of mutual correlation. Our computed temporal variation of b-value in Hazara region shows a significant decrease prior to 2005 Kashmir earthquake.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The present paper deals with the propagation of Love-type wave in an initially stressed irregular vertically heterogeneous layer lying over an initially stressed isotropic layer and an initially stressed isotropic half-space. Two different types of irregularities, viz., rectangular and parabolic, are considered at the interface of uppermost initially stressed heterogeneous layer and intermediate initially stressed isotropic layer. Dispersion equations are obtained in closed form for both cases of irregularities, distinctly. The effect of size and shape of irregularity, horizontal compressive initial stress, horizontal tensile initial stress, heterogeneity of the uppermost layer and width ratio of the layers on phase velocity of Love-type wave are the major highlights of the study. Comparative study has been made to identify the effects of different shapes of irregularity, presence of heterogeneity and initial stresses. Numerical computations have been carried out and depicted by means of graphs for the present study.</p>

				<title>Spectroscopy of olivine basalts using FieldSpec and ASTER data: A case study from Wadi Natash volcanic field, south Eastern Desert, Egypt</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1475-1486</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper aims at revealing the spectral characteristics of the olivine basalts exposed at Wadi Natash area, Egypt, using FieldSpec spectroradiometer. It also evaluates band ratios and fusion techniques for mapping purposes using ASTER data. Several volcanic episodes occurred during Early- to Late-Cretaceous are recorded in the study area. Early-Cretaceous olivine basalts are highly carbonated. Late-Cretaceous eruptions took place throughout several volcanic cones aligned in NW direction. Based on FieldSpec measurements and petrographic data, two groups of olivine basalt namely `A' and `B' are recognized. Fresh olivine basalt (group A) is characterized by low flat spectral profile with overall low reflectance values (~20%). Spectral profile of altered olivine basalt (group B) shows moderate reflectance values (~37%) with four little absorption features around the 1.10, 1.40, 2.00 and 2.35 μm wavelength regions. These absorption features are attributed mainly to the presence of chlorite and carbonate alteration products as indicated by petrographic examination. ASTER false colour composite band ratio image (3/2:R, 8/1:G and 8/5:B) discriminates easily the fresh and altered basalts by deep blue and red-dish blue colours respectively. Image fusion between previously mentioned FCC ratios image and high spatial resolution ASTER panchromatic image are carried out using brovey and HSV transformation methods. Visual and statistical assessment methods proved that HSV fusion image yields better image interpretability results compared to brovey image. It improves the spatial resolution of original FCC ratios image with acceptable spectral preservation. The present study proved the usefulness of Field-Spec spectral profiles and the processed ASTER data for discriminating different olivine basalt groups exposed at the study area.</p>

				<title>Geoelectric investigation to delineate groundwater potential and recharge zones in Suki river basin, north Maharashtra</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1487-1501</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Suki river basin of Raver sub-division is located towards the northeastern part of Jalgaon district in Maharashtra State. The existing land use pattern of the region clearly shows that more than 60% of the area is utilized for agricultural sector. Groundwater is the major source of irrigation and domestic purposes. To assess the overall water resources development of Raver area for better environment in future, investigation was carried out with the help of geophysical indicators. Vertical electrical sounding studies were conducted at 17 stations in the study area using Wenner configuration. The study was aimed at characterizing the aquifer in the area as well as assessing its potential risk to contaminant seepage in terms of protective capacity of the overburden rock materials using Dar-Z arrouk (D-Z) parameters, viz., the transverse resistance (𝑇), longitudinal conductance (𝑆), transverse resistivity ($\rho_{t}$) and longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{l}$). These were computed to generate the resistivity regime of freshwater-bearing formations and its movement. The central-western part of the study area reflects very good to good protective capacity rating as can be seen from the high longitudinal conductance values. The low value of the protective capacity in the eastern part is making the aquifer system in the area highly vulnerable to surface contamination. This indicates that the ground water quality may have been deteriorated in the area and borehole water samples should be randomly sampled for contaminant loads based on this analysis.</p>

				<title>Partitioning and analyzing temporal variability of wash and bed material loads in a forest watershed in Iran</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1503-1515</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The amount of transported material from a hillslope or channel, mirrors the watershed health, which needs to be quantified. However, the contribution of different sediment sources to sediment load has not been adequately studied. In this study, 24 samples of suspended load, bed load and channel material were taken bi-weekly for a period of one year from the Kojour River of the Educational and Research Forest Watershed of Tarbiat Modares University in Iran. The suspended sediment concentration and particle-size distribution were determined. The total sediment load was then partitioned into bed load, wash load and suspended bed material load based on three criteria: (i) the upper limit of 63 micron, (ii) the Einstein method, and (iii) the lower limit of sediment particles in the channel material. The results suggested a significant contribution of wash load compared to suspended bed material and bed loads ratio of 96.8, 2.65 and 0.55%, respectively. The ratio of suspended bed material load to wash load varied from 13.12% (the maximum) in winter to 11.02, 2.70 and 0.91% in autumn, spring and summer, respectively. The results also showed the effects of flow discharge on different components of sediment loads. While, the flow discharge significantly affected bed load and wash load with respective correlation coefficients (𝑟) of 0.520 and 0.464 &#60; 𝑟 &#60; 0.535 for three methods with significant level (𝑝) between 0.007 and 0.022. It had little influence on suspended bed material load (–0.243 &#60; 𝑟 &#60; 0.277 with 0.190 &#60; 𝑝 &#60; 0.253).</p>

				<title>Evaluating the influence of spatial resolutions of DEM on watershed runoff and sediment yield using SWAT</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1517-1529</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Digital elevation model (DEM) of a watershed forms key basis for hydrologic modelling and its resolution plays a key role in accurate prediction of various hydrological processes. This study appraises the effect of different DEMs with varied spatial resolutions (namely TOPO 20 m, CARTO 30 m, ASTER 30 m, SRTM 90 m, GEO-AUS 500 m and USGS 1000 m) on hydrological response of watershed using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and applied for a case study of Kaddam watershed in India for estimating runoff and sediment yield. From the results of case study, it was observed that reach lengths, reach slopes, minimum and maximum elevations, sub-watershed areas, land use mapping areas within the sub-watershed and number of HRUs varied substantially due to DEM resolutions, and consequently resulted in a considerable variability in estimated daily runoff and sediment yields. It was also observed that, daily runoff values have increased (decreased) on low (high) rainy days respectively with coarser resolution of DEM. The daily sediment yield values from each sub-watershed decreased with coarser resolution of the DEM. The study found that the performance of SWAT model prediction was not influenced much for finer resolution DEMs up to 90 m for estimation of runoff, but it certainly influenced the estimation of sediment yields. The DEMs of TOPO 20 m and CARTO 30 m provided better estimates of sub-watershed areas, runoff and sediment yield values over other DEMs.</p>

				<title>A study on the heavy rainfall event around Kedarnath area (Uttarakhand) on 16 June 2013</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1531-1544</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The heavy rainfall event during 14–17 June 2013 in Uttarakhand and more specifically, its occurrence around the Kedarnath region on 16 June 2013 with devastating floods and massive landslides ruined thousands of lives and properties. Increasing levels of water in two main rivers of the State, namely Alaknanda and Mandakini, resulted in the collapse of bridges, damaging and washing away of property worth many crores. In the present study, the advanced research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system (hereafter used as WRF model) is used to simulate this heavy rainfall event. The synoptic analysis at different locations such as Rudraprayag, Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Pauri, Tehri, Dehradun and adjoining districts suggested that the rainfall is about 200% more than normal. The rainfall associated with this event is well captured with the model simulation. The rainfall simulated by WRF model is in the range of 320–400 mm over Kedarnath during the actual occurrence of the event, which is in reasonably good agreement with the observed value of rainfall (325 mm) collected by Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.</p>

				<title>Numerical simulation of an intense precipitation event over Rudraprayag in the central Himalayas during 13–14 September 2012</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1545-1561</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A recent heavy precipitation event on 13 September 2012 and the associated landslide on 14 September 2012 is one of the most severe calamities that occurred over the Rudraprayag region in Uttarakhand, India. This heavy precipitation event is also emblematic of the natural hazards occuring in the Himalayan region. Study objectives are to present dynamical fields associated with this event, and understand the processes related to the severe storm event, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF ver 3.4) model. A triple-nested WRF model is configured over the Uttarakhand region centered over Ukhimath (30° 30'N; 79° 15'E), where the heavy precipitation event is reported. Model simulation of the intense storm on 13 September 2012 is with parameterized and then with explicit convection are examined for the 3 km grid spacing domain. The event was better simulated without the consideration of convection parameterization for the innermost domain. The role of steep orography forcings is notable in rapid dynamical lifting as revealed by the positive vorticity and high reflectivity values and the intensification of the monsoonal storm. Incursion of moist air, in the lower levels, converges at the foothills of the mountains and rise along the orography to form the updraft zone of the storm. Such rapid unstable ascent leads to deep convection and increases the condensation rate of the water vapour forming clouds at a swift rate. This culminates into high intensity precipitation which leads to high amount of surface runoff over regions of susceptible geomorphology causing the landslide. Even for this intense and potentially unsual rainfall event, the processes involved appear to be the `classic' enhanced convective activity by orographic lifting of the moist air, as an important driver of the event.</p>

				<title>Vertical structure of atmosphere in pre-monsoon season over Bangalore</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1563-1572</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper discusses the variation of dry bulb and dew point temperature (T and T<sub>d</sub>) on the days with and without thunderstorm (TSD and NTSD) over Bangalore during pre-monsoon season. The thermo-dynamic parameters like convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition energy (CIN), precipitable water content (PWC) and dynamical parameter vertical wind shear difference (VWS) are studied. The mean profiles of T, T<sub>d</sub> are generated using March–May upper air data of 1730 hrs IST from 2000–2007 for Bangalore. These are also generated on the TSD and NTSD respectively. It is found that the difference between mean profile of T for TSD/NTSD and seasonal mean is negative/positive till 200 hPa. On the other hand, the difference of the seasonal mean of T<sub>d</sub> and that of T<sub>d</sub> on the TSD/NTSD is found to be positive/negative till 300 hPa. These results are found to be significant at 99% confidence. It is found that T is less than the mean at surface till 600 hPa on TSD, whereas it is 0.5° C above average on the NTSD respectively. The difference between the T<sub>d</sub> on the TSD and mean T<sub>d</sub> is of the order of 3–5° C till 300 hPa. On the NTSD, this difference ranges between −1 and −2° C in the entire troposphere. The mean values of CAPE, CIN, PWC and VWS for Bangalore in pre-monsoon season are found to be 1324, 49.3 J/kg, 30 mm and −0.0007 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. These parameters were used as predictors for forecasting a thunderstorm. The critical success index and Heidke skill score were used for evaluating the forecast skill of the above parameters for 2 years from 2008 to 2009. CAPE and PWC are able to distinguish a TSD from that of a NTSD with 99% confidence. It is found that these scores are 0.44 and 0.35 for CAPE and 0.49 and 0.53 for precipitable water content.</p>

				<title>Characteristics of surface wind structure of tropical cyclones over the north Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1573-1598</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Tropical cyclone (TC) wind field monitoring and forecast are important for mariners, ships on sea and modelling group for creation of synthetic vortex, and storm surge and coastal inundation forecasting. Among others, a multi-platform satellite surface wind analysis developed by Co-operative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA), USA for the TCs are referred by India Meteorological Department for surface wind field monitoring of TC. Hence, a study has been undertaken to analyze the characteristics of surface wind distribution and hence the structure of TC based on the real time data available from CIRA during 2007–2013. The study includes 19 TCs over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and six over Arabian Sea (AS). The maximum radial extent of winds reaching threshold values of 34(17), 50(26) and 64(33) knot (ms<sup>−1</sup>) in each of the four geographical quadrants has been segregated with respect to season of formation, basin of formation and intensity of TC for analysis. The objective is to develop a reference surface wind structure of TC and examine its validity with respect to physical processes.</p>
					<p>The size of outer core (34(17) knot (ms<sup>−1</sup>) wind radial extension) as well as inner core (50(26) and 64(33) knot (ms<sup>−1</sup>) wind radial extension) increases significantly with increase in intensification of TC over BOB during both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons and over AS during pre-monsoon season. The outer core of winds in TCs over the BOB is asymmetric in both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons and for all categories of intensity of TCs. On the other hand, the asymmetry in inner core winds is significantly less. There is also no asymmetry in radial wind extension over the AS during both the seasons, except in case of outer core wind radial extension of VSCS during pre-monsoon season. The low level environment like enhanced cross equatorial flow, lower/middle level relative humidity, vertical wind shear and proximity of TC to the land surface are the determining factors for the size and asymmetry of TCs over the NIO.</p>

				<title>Numerical simulation of Tibetan Plateau heating anomaly influence on westerly jet in spring</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1599-1607</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The intensity and location of the westerly jet (WJ) in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere has been closely related to weather and climate changes in Eurasia. In this paper, we analyzed the seasonal and inter-annual variations in the strength and position of the WJ, using the NCEP-DOE reanalysis II (NCEP) data. Spring is the period that the Tibetan Plateau (TP) transits from a cold to a warm condition, and at the same time the WJ weakens and moves northward. Correlation analysis showed that the westerly wind over the north (south) of the TP has a significant positive (negative) correlation with the TP surface temperature in spring during 1979–2013 (99.9% significance level). In spring, surface sensible heat release dominates thermal conditions of the TP, while the contribution of latent heat becomes important in summer. We conducted three numerical experiments to determine the effects of the TP surface sensible heat flux anomaly in spring on the intensity and location of the WJ using the community atmosphere model 5 (CAM5). Experimental results indicated that changing the TP surface sensible heat flux can produce changes in the TP heat sources.When the TP sensible heat flux is switched off (TPSHL), the TP surface has a lower temperature and no longer heats up the middle and upper troposphere, and leads to a maximum cooling of –1.2&#xb0;C at 200 hPa over the TP with a significance level of 95%. In spring, the abnormal low temperature over the TP caused the WJ to strengthen and move southward compared with the control experiment (CTL), and this results in a westerly (easterly) wind anomaly over the south (north) of the TP with a significance level of 95%. We obtained the opposite conclusion from the comparison of the enhanced TP surface sensible heat flux (TPSHH) with CTL test results. In TPSHL, the WJ is still steadily located near 30&#xb0;N in May as well as April, i.e., the first northward jump occurs from May to June which is a delay of one month compared to CTL. While in TPSHH, the WJ moves northward approximately 10&#xb0; of latitude from April to May which is 5&#xb0; larger than CTL. Thus, the strength and north–south migration of WJ is closely linked to the TP heat source, especially during the spring–summer seasonal transition period, while TP surface temperature increased significantly and showed early signal compared to the surroundings with the global warming. Therefore, considerable attention must be paid to the location and strength of the WJ with respect to the sensible heat flux over the TP.</p>

				<title>Trends in rainfall and rainfall-related extremes in the east coast of peninsular Malaysia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1609-1622</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coastlines have been identified as the most vulnerable regions with respect to hydrological hazards as a result of climate change and variability. The east of peninsular Malaysia is not an exception for this, considering the evidence of heavy rainfall resulting in floods as an annual phenomenon and also water scarcity due to long dry spells in the region. This study examines recent trends in rainfall and rainfallrelated extremes such as, maximum daily rainfall, number of rainy days, average rainfall intensity, heavy rainfall days, extreme rainfall days, and precipitation concentration index in the east coast of peninsular Malaysia. Recent 40 years (1971–2010) rainfall records from 54 stations along the east coast of peninsular Malaysia have been analyzed using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test and the Sen's slope method. The Monte Carlo simulation technique has been used to determine the field significance of the regional trends. The results showed that there was a substantial increase in the annual rainfall as well as the rainfall during the monsoon period. Also, there was an increase in the number of heavy rainfall days during the past four decades.</p>

				<title>Temporal precipitation trend analysis at the Langat River Basin, Selangor, Malaysia</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1623-1638</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Langat River Basin provides fresh water for about 1.2 million people in the Langat and Klang valleys. Any change in the pattern of rainfall could affect the quantity of water in the basin. Studying the pattern of change in rainfall is crucial for managing the available water resources in the basin. Thus, in this study, for the first time, both parametric and non-parametric methods were employed to detect rainfall trend in the basin for the period 1982–2011. The trends were determined at 30 rainfall stations using the Mann–Kendall (MK) test, the Sen's slope estimator and the linear regression analysis. Lag-1 approach was utilized to test the serial correlation of the series. On the annual scale, it was found that most of the stations in the basin were characterized with insignificant trends. The significant trends were found only at the four stations, namely 44301, 44305, 44320 and 2719001. The results of the seasonal trend analysis showed that most of the stations during the northeast monsoon (NEM) and the inter monsoon 1 (INT1) seasons and half of the stations during the southwest monsoon (SWM) season experienced insignificant positive trends. To the contrary, for the inter monsoon 2 (INT2) season, majority of the stations showed negative trends. It was found that during the NEM season the station 44301, for the INT1 season stations 44301, 2719001 and 3118069 were established as having significant changes, while in the SWM season station 2917001 and during the INT2 season, the stations 2615131 and 44301 showed significant trends.

				<title>Numerical simulation and observations of very severe cyclone generated surface wave fields in the north Indian Ocean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1639-1651</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accurate wave forecast is most needed during tropical cyclones as it has adverse effects on the entire marine activities. The present work evaluates the performance of a wave forecasting system under very severe cyclonic conditions for the Indian Ocean. The wave model results are validated separately for the deep water and shallow water using <i>in-situ</i> observations. Satellite altimeter observations are also utilized for validation purpose. The results show that the model performance is accurate (SI &#x3c; 26% and correlation &#x3e; 0.9) and consistent during very severe cyclones (categories 4 and 5). The power of the cyclone waves which hit in the eastern Indian coastal region is also analysed and it reveals that the coastal region which lies on the right side of the cyclone track receives high amount wave energy throughout the cyclone period. The study also says that the abnormal waves mostly present on the right side of the track.</p>

				<title>A simple depression-filling method for raster and irregular elevation datasets</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1653-1665</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A variety of methods have been developed to process digital elevation models (DEMs) in order to extract morphological properties of land surfaces. Almost all rely on depression filling to facilitate drainage analysis. This study proposes an intuitive and relatively simple depression-filling algorithm, which is readily applicable to raster and irregular datasets. In this study, topographic data of two watershed areas were provided to test the capability of this new algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately identify the locations of depressions and efficiently assign pseudo flow directions across the filled depressions.</p>

				<title>Delineation of the recharge areas and distinguishing the sources of karst springs in Bringi watershed, Kashmir Himalayas using hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1667-1676</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Water samples were collected from precipitation, streams and karst springs of the mountainous Bringi catchment of Kashmir Himalayas for major ions, stable isotopes (𝛿<sup>18</sup>O and 𝛿D) and <sup>3</sup>H analysis. The main objective is to identify the potential recharge area for karst springs. The water in the Triassic limestone aquifer of the Bringi watershed is characterized by low levels of mineralization with TDS of the spring water samples ranging between 99 and 222 mg/l except the Kongamnag spring, which contained TDS up to 425 mg/l. As expected in an area with dominant carbonate lithology, Ca–HCO<sub>3</sub> and Ca–Mg–HCO<sub>3</sub> hydrochemical facies were found. Based on the amount weighed monthly averages (𝑛 = 6), the local meteoric water line (LMWL) for Bringi watershed is 𝛿D = 7.7 ×𝛿<sup>18</sup>O + 11.1 (𝑟<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). The isotopic signature of winter precipitation is reflected in stream and spring water in late spring and is therefore, a representative of snow melting. The spring waters in September bear the 𝛿<sup>2</sup>H and 𝛿<sup>18</sup>O enriched isotopic signatures of summer rainfall. With the help of the local vertical isotopic gradient of precipitation (𝛿<sup>18</sup>O = −0.27&#8240; per 100 m increase in elevation), the mean elevation of precipitation that recharged the aquifer is estimated and ranges about 2500–2900 m amsl. There is a very strong correlation (𝑟<sup>2</sup> = 0.97) between the seasonal isotope composition of streams and springs, indicating that streams and springs either share similar catchments or the springs are recharged by the streams.</p>

				<title>Satellite-derived geoid for the estimation of lithospheric cooling and basal heat flux anomalies over the northern Indian Ocean lithosphere</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1677-1691</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The northern Indian Ocean consists of older Bay of Bengal (BOB) oceanic lithosphere with numerous intra-plate loads; whereas, contrasting elements like active Mid-Ocean ridge divergence and slow spreading ridges are present in the relatively younger (&#x3c;60 Ma) Arabian Sea oceanic lithosphere. The mechanism of lithospheric cooling of young age oceanic lithosphere from the moderately active and slow spreading Carlsberg Ridge is analysed by considering the hypothesis of near lithospheric convective action or whole upper mantle convection. We addressed these issues by studying the marine geoid at different spatial wavelengths and retrieved and compared their lithospheric cooling signatures, plate spreading and distribution of mass and heat anomalies along with seismicity, bathymetry, gravity and isochron age data. Results show that progressive cooling of young-aged oceanic lithosphere from the Mid-Ocean Carlsberg Ridge is because of conductive cooling and those signals are retrieved in the shorter wavelength band (111 &#x3c; 𝜆 &#x3c; 1900 km) of constrained residual geoid with mass anomaly sources near to sublithospheric. This shows steadiness in the geoid anomaly decay rate (∼–0.1 m/Ma), consistency in the growth of thermal boundary layer and progressive fall of basal temperature and heat flux (900–300 K and 100–18 mW m<sup>−2</sup>) with increase of lithospheric age. The above observations are attributed to the fact that the advective–convective action beneath the Mid-Ocean Carlsberg Ridge is driven by the basal temperature gradient between the lithosphere and the near lithospheric low viscose thin layer. But, for the case of old-aged oceanic lithosphere in the BOB, the residual geoid anomaly cooling signals are not prominently seen in the same band as that of the Arabian Sea because of the Ninetyeast Ridge magmatism. However, its cooling anomaly signatures are retrieved at relatively higher band (1335 &#x2264; 𝜆 &#x2264; 3081 km) having erratic geoid decay rates (–0.3 to 0.2 m/Ma) owing to vigorous convective thermal instabilities originated around 290–530 km from the plume remnant in the upper mantle (for the case of the BOB). We discussed that such instabilities had transported sufficient heat energy to accelerate the erstwhile fast movement of the Indian Plate prior to the India–Eurasia continent–continent collision.</p>

				<title>Study of thermo-hydro-mechanical processes at a potential site of an Indian nuclear waste repository</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1693-1708</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed scientific study is required for the disposal of high-level radioactive wastes because they generate extremely high heat during their half-life period. Although, several methods have been proposed for the disposal of nuclear wastes, deep underground repository is considered to be a suitable option.</p>
					<p>In this paper, field investigation has been done near to Bhima basin of peninsular India. Detailed fracture analysis near the borehole shows very prominent maxima of fractures striking N55&#xb0;E coinciding with the trace of master basement cover metasediment fault. Physico-mechanical properties of rocks have been determined in the laboratory.</p>
					<p>The host rock chosen is granite and engineered barrier near the canister is proposed to be clay. A thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) analysis has been done to study the effect of heat on deformations, stresses and pore-pressure variation in granite and clay barriers. For this purpose, finite difference method has been used. Suitable rheological models have been used to model elastic canister and elasto-plastic engineered barrier and host rock. It has been found that both temperature and stresses at any point in the rockmass is below the design criteria which are 100&#xb0;C for temperature and 0.2 for damage number.</p>

					<p>In this work, the effects of viscosity and diffusion on thermoelastic interactions in an infinite medium with a spherical cavity are studied. The formulation is applied to the generalized thermoelasticity based on the theory of generalized thermoelastic diffusion with one relaxation time. The surface of the spherical cavity is taken to be traction free and subjected to both heating and external constant magnetic field. The solution is obtained in the Laplace transform domain by using a direct approach. The solution of the problem in the physical domain obtained numerically using a method based on Fourier expansion techniques. The temperature, displacement, stress, concentration as well as the chemical potential are obtained and represented graphically. Comparisons are made within the theory in the presence and absence of viscosity and diffusion.</p>

				<title>Variation of surface electric field during geomagnetic disturbed period at Maitri, Antarctica</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1721-1733</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The paper discusses on the variations of the atmospheric vertical electric field measured at sub-auroral station Maitri (70&#xb0;75&#x2032;S, 11&#xb0;75&#x2032;E), and polar station Vostok (78.5&#xb0;S, 107&#xb0;E) during the geomagnetic disturbances on 25–26 January 2006. Diurnal variation of surface electric field measured at Maitri shows a similar variation with worldwide thunderstorm activity, whereas the departure of the field is observed during disturbed periods. This part of the field corresponds to the magnetospheric/ionospheric (an additional generator in the polar regions) voltage generators. Solar wind parameters and planetary indices represent the temporal variation of the disturbances, and digital fluxgate magnetometer variation continuously monitored to trace the auroral movement at Maitri. We have observed that the electrojet movement leaves its signature on vertical and horizontal components of the DFM in addition; the study infers the position of auroral current wedge with respect to Maitri. To exhibit the auroral oval, OVATION model is obtained with the aid of DMSP satellite and UV measurements. It is noted that the Maitri is almost within the auroral oval during the periods of disturbances. To examine the simultaneous changes in the vertical electric field associated with this magnetic disturbance, the dawn–dusk potential is studied for every UT hours; the potential was obtained from Weimer model and SuperDARN radar. The comparison reveals the plausible situation for the superposition of dawn–dusk potential on surface electric field over Maitri. This observation also shows that the superposition may not be consistent with the phase of the electrojet. Comparison of surface electric field at Maitri and Vostok shows that the parallel variation exhibits with each other, but during the period of geomagnetic disturbances, the influence is not much discerned at Vostok.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In 3D gravity modelling, right rectangular vertical prism model with linear and nonlinear density and polyhedral bodies with linear density variation exist in geophysical literature. Here, we propose a vertical pyramid model with depth-wise parabolic density contrast variation. Initially, we validate our analytic expression against the gravity effect of a right rectangular parallelepiped of constant density contrast. We provide two synthetic examples and a case study for illustrating the effectiveness of our pyramid model in gravity modelling. The included case study of Los Angeles basin, California demonstrates the comparative advantages of our pyramid model over a conventional right rectangular vertical prism model. Our pyramid model could be quite effective as a building block for evaluating the gravity effect of an arbitrarily-shaped 3D or 2.5-D source(s).</p>

				<title>A new structural interpretation relating NW Libya to the Hun Graben, western Sirt Basin based on a new paleostress inversion</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1745-1763</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study is based on fault-slip data (striated fault planes with known sense of slip) measured in outcrops in two structural domains located along the Hun Graben, western Sirt Basin (150 fault-slip data) and the Jifarah Basin and Nafusah Uplift, northwest Libya (200 fault-slip data). Pre-existing field data collected in two previous studies were reprocessed using standard inversion methods in MyFault<sup>TM</sup> (v. 1.03) stereonet software, produced by Pangaea Scientific Ltd.</p>
					<p>The aim of this study was to use paleostress orientations and relative paleostress magnitudes (stress ratios), determined using the reduced stress concept, to test a new understanding of the kinematic characteristics, the relationship between the two areas and the paleostress fields that controlled the evolution of the fault systems responsible for the observed deformation.</p>
					<p>Various types of faults (normal faults, sinistral normal faults, dextral normal faults and strike-slip faults) were recorded from outcrops comprised of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary sequences in which a lineation rake is present on minor structures with displacement ranging from several centimetres to several metres.</p>
					<p>Two different domains of a NNE–SSW directed extension regime ranging from N12&#xb0;E to 25&#xb0;E and minor ENE–WSW and WNW–ESE compression were identified in the analysis. The results are remarkably homogeneous at all sites and consistent with progressive collisional coupling of Africa and Europe, being under approximately WNW–ESE reactivated compressional stresses during the Late Eocene-age. The new kinematic and structural conceptual model that has been proposed is a test of the prevailing tectonic models describing the Cenozoic kinematic evolution of the areas. The results show the remarkable influence of basement fabrics of different ages on the subsequent structural development of NW Libya.</p>

				<title>Depositional architecture and sequence stratigraphy of Pleistocene coarse-grained deltas along the Ligurian coast (Italy)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1765-1780</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study aims to develop a better understanding of the stratigraphy of the southern side of the Maritime Alps and of the Ligurian Sea during the Plio-Pleistocene. Five stratigraphic sections were measured and studied in the Segno River valley (Liguria, Italy). These sections are composed of Lower to Middle Pleistocene marine and continental deposits. Based on detailed mapping and sedimentological analysis, 12 marine and deltaic facies were identified. These facies were grouped into facies associations. Two allostratigraphic units were recognized, namely U1 and U2 from oldest to youngest. The lower unit (U1) represents the evolution of a coarse-grained delta developed in a valley or embayment. Within the deltaic sequence, transgressive and highstand systems tracts were recognized. The coarsening/shallowing upward trend observed within the sections suggests that the delta prograded rapidly in the landward portion of the canyon adjacent to the paleo-river outlet. The upper boundary of U1 is represented by a subaerial unconformity overlain by U2, which is composed of sediments deposited by several alluvial fan systems.</p>

				<title>Petrological and geochemical studies of ultramafic–mafic rocks from the North Puruliya Shear Zone (eastern India)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1781-1799</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ultramafic and mafic rocks occur within a linear belt, trending nearly E–W along North Puruliya Shear Zone of the Chhotanagpur Gneissic Complex (CGC). These rocks are classified as gabbro, norite, gabbronorite, dolerite, diorite, olivine-websterite and lherzolite. Mafic rocks (Group 1) often occur in association with ultramafic variants (Group 2) and sometimes in isolation. A genetic link has been established between these mafic and ultramafic rocks using disposition of ultramafic and mafic rocks in the outcrop, systematic variation in modal mineralogy, co-linearity of plots in biaxial chemical variation diagram. Chemical composition of biotite and clinopyroxene reveal calc-alkaline nature and arc signature in these mafic–ultramafic rocks and whole rock geochemical characters indicate similarity with arc magma in subduction zone setting. The high values of Mg no. (47–81) and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (5.5–17.9) of mafic rocks indicate primitive, aluminous nature of the parental melt and presence of amphibole and biotite indicate its hydrous nature. The parent mafic melt evolved through fractionation of olivine, spinel, clinopyroxene and plagioclase. The crystal cumulates gave rise to the ultramafic rocks and the associated mafic rocks formed from residual melt. Crustal contamination played an important role in magmatic evolution as evident from variation in abundance of Rb in different lithomembers. Mafic–ultramafic rocks of the present study have been compared with intra-cratonic layered complexes, mafic–ultramafic rocks of high grade terrain, Alaskan type ultramafic–mafic complex and ophiolites. It is observed that the ultramafic–mafic rocks of present study have similarity with Alaskan type complex.</p>

				<title>Study of fractures in Precambrian crystalline rocks using field technique in and around Balarampur, Purulia district, West Bengal, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>1801-1812</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Location of recharge zone in Precambrian crystalline rock is still unclear. The present study attempts to perform a detailed analysis of the joints/fractures developed in a Precambrian metamorphic terrain in and around Balarampur in Purulia district of West Bengal, India using bedrock data. The analysis shows that the orientations of major fracture trends are variable along with varying lithological units and structural affinities. The application of lithology-based analysis technique identifies highly predominant fracture frequency and fracture aperture in mica schist and phyllite in the area. This property is not evident in the granite gneiss and epidiorite. The moderate to high fracture permeability value is also associated with the fractures occurring in the shear zone. Mica schist and phyllite associated with the shear zone may represent a permeable recharge zone in the region.</p>

				<title>Reconstruction of the paleo-coastline of Santorini island (Greece), after the 1613 BC volcanic eruption: A GIS-based quantitative methodology</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0011</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A catastrophic volcanic explosion took place in Thera/Santorini island around 1613 BC, known as the `Minoan' eruption. Many papers have dealt with the shape of the shoreline of the island before the eruption, but none with the shape of the shoreline exactly after it, assuming that it would be the same with the contemporary one. However, this is not correct due to the wave erosion. In this paper, a new DEM was constructed, covering both land and submarine morphology, then topographic sections were drawn around the island. Using these sections, the `missing parts' (sea-wave erosion) were calculated, the shoreline was reconstructed as it was one day after the eruption and finally the erosion rate was calculated.</p>

				<title>Late quaternary sea level changes of Gabes coastal plain and shelf: Identification of the MIS 5c and MIS 5a onshore highstands, southern Mediterranean</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0013-0028</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The continental shelf of the Gulf of Gabes is outlined, during the MIS 5c and MIS 5a onshore highstands, by the genesis of forced regressive beach ridges situated respectively at –19 m b.s.l/100 ka and –8 m b.s.l/80 ka. This area, considered as a stable domain since at least the last 130 ka (Bouaziz <i>et al</i>. 2003), is a particular zone for the reconstruction of the late quaternary sea-level changes in the region. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data and field observations are highlighted to deduce interaction between hydrodynamic factors and antecedent topography. Variations in geomorphology were attributed to geological inheritance. Petrography and sedimentary facies of the submerged coastal ridges reveal that the palaeocoastal morphology was more agitated than today and the fluvial discharges are consistent. Actual morphologic trend deduced from different environment coasts (sandy coasts, sea cliffs and tidal flat) is marked by accumulation of marine sands and progradation.</p>

				<title>Prediction and error growth in the daily forecast of precipitation from the NCEP CFSv2 over the subdivisions of Indian subcontinent</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0029-0045</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study investigates the forecast skill and predictability of various indices of south Asian monsoon as well as the subdivisions of the Indian subcontinent during JJAS season for the time domain of 2001–2013 using NCEP CFSv2 output. It has been observed that the daily mean climatology of precipitation over the land points of India is underestimated in the model forecast as compared to observation. The monthly model bias of precipitation shows the dry bias over the land points of India and also over the Bay of Bengal, whereas the Himalayan and Arabian Sea regions show the wet bias. We have divided the Indian landmass into five subdivisions namely central India, southern India, Western Ghat, northeast and southern Bay of Bengal regions based on the spatial variation of observed mean precipitation in JJAS season. The underestimation over the land points of India during mature phase was originated from the central India, southern Bay of Bengal, southern India and Western Ghat regions. The error growth in June forecast is slower as compared to July forecast in all the regions. The predictability error also grows slowly in June forecast as compared to July forecast in most of the regions. The doubling time of predictability error was estimated to be in the range of 3–5 days for all the regions. Southern India and Western Ghats are more predictable in the July forecast as compared to June forecast, whereas IMR, northeast, central India and southern Bay of Bengal regions have the opposite nature.</p>

				<title>Simulation of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations at Tsukuba tall tower using WRF-CO<sub>2</sub> tracer transport model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0047-0064</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Simulation of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) at hourly/weekly intervals and fine vertical resolution at the continental or coastal sites is challenging because of coarse horizontal resolution of global transport models. Here the regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with atmospheric chemistry is adopted for simulating atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (hereinafter WRF-CO<sub>2</sub>) in nonreactive chemical tracer mode. Model results at horizontal resolution of 27 &#xd7; 27 km and 31 vertical levels are compared with hourly CO<sub>2</sub> measurements from Tsukuba, Japan (36.05&#xb0;N, 140.13&#xb0;E) at tower heights of 25 and 200 m for the entire year 2002. Using the wind rose analysis, we find that the fossil fuel emission signal from the megacity Tokyo dominates the diurnal, synoptic and seasonal variations observed at Tsukuba. Contribution of terrestrial biosphere fluxes is of secondary importance for CO<sub>2</sub> concentration variability. The phase of synoptic scale variability in CO<sub>2</sub> at both heights are remarkably well simulated the observed data (correlation coefficient &#x3e;0.70) for the entire year. The simulations of monthly mean diurnal cycles are in better agreement with the measurements at lower height compared to that at the upper height. The modelled vertical CO<sub>2</sub> gradients are generally greater than the observed vertical gradient. Sensitivity studies show that the simulation of observed vertical gradient can be improved by increasing the number of vertical levels from 31 in the model WRF to 37 (4 below 200 m) and using the Mellor–Yamada–Janjic planetary boundary scheme. These results have large implications for improving transport model simulation of CO<sub>2</sub> over the continental sites.</p>

				<title>Decadal variation of ocean heat content and tropical cyclone activity over the Bay of Bengal</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0065-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The upper ocean heat content up to 700 m depth (OHC<sub>700</sub>) is an important climatic parameter required for atmospheric and oceanographic studies like a cyclone. In this study, therefore, an attempt has been made to examine the inter-decadal variations of tropical cyclone (TC) activity and OHC<sub>700</sub> over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) for the post-monsoon season (October–December) during 1955–2013 periods. The sea-surface temperature (SST), geopotential height at 500 hPa, low-level vorticity at 850 hPa, vertical wind shear between 200 and 850 hPa, middle tropospheric humidity at 500 hPa and outgoing long-wave radiation are also being studied using seasonal mean data. The results show a significant inter-decadal variation during 1955–2013, with two distinct decadal periods: active decadal period (ADP) (1955–1988) and inactive decadal period (IDP) (1989–2013). The anomalies of these parameters are opposite in phase for two periods. It is found that the large scale atmospheric features and oceanic parameters have significant inter-decadal variability, but frequency of the tropical cyclone is attributed to the variation in the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic conditions rather than the variation of oceanic parameters OHC<sub>700</sub> and SSTs during the post-monsoon season.</p>

				<title>Century scale climate change in the central highlands of Sri Lanka</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0075-0084</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, an analysis of century scale climate trends in the central highlands of Sri Lanka is presented. Monthly rainfall and temperature records of the period 1869–2006 from five climatological stations were analyzed. The trend is calculated by the least square regression analysis and the significance of the observed trend is estimated using the Mann–Kendall statistic. The results clearly show that there is a statistically significant decrease in annual rainfall in the western slopes of the central highlands. Throughout the last century, the annual reduction of rainfall in Nuwara Eliya which is at an altitude of 1895 m was 5.2 mm/year. The decrease is largely due to the reduction in southwest monsoon rainfall which contributes to 75% of the total reduction. No significant change was observed on the eastern side of the central highlands which receives rainfall predominantly from the northeast monsoons. The mean annual temperature in the mountainous region shows a uniform increasing trend which is in line with the 100-year global temperature increase of 0.8 ± 0.2&#xb0;C. Kandy, which is at an altitude of 477 m and closely linked with the rainfall climatology of Nuwara Eliya, showed no significant change in the mean annual temperature. If the current trend continues, in another 100 years, western and eastern slopes of central highlands will receive the same amount of rainfall from the southwest monsoon and the northeast monsoon which will have far reaching consequences for Sri Lanka’s economy and the ecology of the hill country.</p>

				<page>0085-0093</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study examined hourly temperature data of two locations of Mumbai metropolitan city. One data point (Coloba, Mumbai) is in centre of the city and the other one (Santacruz, Mumbai) is at the airport. The study finds that there were many occasions when night-time hourly temperatures over the city centre were considerably higher than that of the airport, even though temperature at the time of sunset at both the places was nearly same. In this study, the occasions, when hourly night-time temperature over city was more than that of the airport by objectively defined threshold value (3.0&#xb0;C in this study) for most of the hours in the night, were termed as heat island events. Analysis of the study reveals that these events are mostly confined to November–February months. The study also found that frequency of such events has doubled in recent two decades in comparison to the earlier two decades.</p>

				<title>Comparison of diurnal dynamics in evaporation rate between bare soil and moss-crusted soil within a revegetated desert ecosystem of northwestern China</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0095-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effects of biological soil crusts (BSCs) on soil evaporation is quite controversial in literature, being either facilitative or inhibitive, and therein few studies have actually conducted direct evaporation measurements. Continuous field measurements of soil water evaporation were conducted on two microlysimeters, i.e., one with sand soil collected from bare sand dune area and the other with moss-crusted soil collected from an area that was revegetated in 1956, from field capacity to dry, at the southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert. We mainly aimed to quantify the diurnal variations of evaporation rate from two soils, and further comparatively discuss the effects of BSCs on soil evaporation after revegetation. Results showed that in clear days with high soil water content (Day 1 and 2), the diurnal variation of soil evaporation rate followed the typical convex upward parabolic curve, reaching its peak around midday. Diurnal evaporation rate and the accumulated evaporation amount of moss-crusted soil were lower (an average of 0.90 times) than that of sand soil in this stage. However, as soil water content decreased to a moderately low level (Day 3 and 4), the diurnal evaporation rate from moss-crusted soil was pronouncedly higher (an average of 3.91 times) than that of sand soil, prolonging the duration of this higher evaporation rate stage; it was slightly higher in the final stage (Day 5 and 6) when soil moisture was very low. We conclude that the effects of moss crusts on soil evaporation vary with different evaporation stages, which is closely related to soil water content, and the variation and transition of evaporation rate between bare soil and moss-crusted soil are expected to be predicted by soil water content.</p>

					<p>Western Ghats are considered as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km<sup>2</sup> (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920–1975, 1975–1985, 1985–1995, 1995–2005 and 2005–2013. The grid cells of 1 km<sup>2</sup> have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920–1975, 0.13 during 1975–1985, 0.12 during 1985–1995 and 0.01 during 1995–2005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km<sup>2</sup> (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920's to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km<sup>2</sup> (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.</p>

				<title>Development of roughness updating based on artificial neural network in a river hydraulic model for flash flood forecasting</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0115-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Flood is the worst weather-related hazard in Taiwan because of steep terrain and storm. The tropical storm often results in disastrous flash flood. To provide reliable forecast of water stages in rivers is indispensable for proper actions in the emergency response during flood. The river hydraulic model based on dynamic wave theory using an implicit finite-difference method is developed with river roughness updating for flash flood forecast. The artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to update the roughness of rivers in accordance with the observed river stages at each time-step of the flood routing process. Several typhoon events at Tamsui River are utilized to evaluate the accuracy of flood forecasting. The results present the adaptive n-values of roughness for river hydraulic model that can provide a better flow state for subsequent forecasting at significant locations and longitudinal profiles along rivers.</p>

				<title>Geochemical evolution of groundwater in southern Bengal Basin: The example of Rajarhat and adjoining areas, West Bengal, India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0129-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Detailed geochemical analysis of groundwater beneath 1223 km<sup>2</sup> area in southern Bengal Basin along with statistical analysis on the chemical data was attempted, to develop a better understanding of the geochemical processes that control the groundwater evolution in the deltaic aquifer of the region. Groundwater is categorized into three types: `excellent', `good' and `poor' and seven hydrochemical facies are assigned to three broad types: `fresh', `mixed' and `brackish' waters. The `fresh' water type dominated with sodium indicates active flushing of the aquifer, whereas chloride-rich `brackish' groundwater represents freshening of modified connate water. The `mixed' type groundwater has possibly evolved due to hydraulic mixing of `fresh' and `brackish' waters. Enrichment of major ions in groundwater is due to weathering of feldspathic and ferro-magnesian minerals by percolating water. The groundwater of Rajarhat New Town (RNT) and adjacent areas in the north and southeast is contaminated with arsenic. Current-pumping may induce more arsenic to flow into the aquifers of RNT and Kolkata cities. Future large-scale pumping of groundwater beneath RNT can modify the hydrological system, which may transport arsenic and low quality water from adjacent aquifers to presently unpolluted aquifer.</p>

				<title>Geochemical characteristics of Kırka (Sarıkaya) borate deposit, northwestern Anatolia, Turkey</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0147-0164</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Kırka borate deposit was deposited in a Miocene lacustrine basin which is closely associated with volcanic activity which lasted from Paleogene to the beginning of Quaternary. Borate mineralization alternates with claystone, mudstone, tuff and fine-layered limestone and mostly shows a lenticular structure. The mineral paragenesis is composed of borax, tincalconite, ulexite, kurnakovite, probertite, tunellite, colemanite, dolomite, smectite group minerals, illite and some firstly reported minerals for the Kırka deposit including hydrochloroborite, brianroulstonite, hilgardite-4M and searlesite minerals. In comparison to average values of earth crust, concentrations of Cs, Sr, Li, As and Se were significantly enriched with respective rates of 21, 15, 14, 3 and 188 folds. Regarding KY, KS1 and KS2 locations, there are differences in both element abundances and their geochemical tendencies which are attributed to variations in discharge regime and physico-chemical conditions of the depositional environment. Independent behaviour of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> might indicate that boron is not associated with clays and carbonates and, therefore, most part of boron must be derived from volcanic activity (hydrothermal solutions, gases). REE data indicate that the Kırka borate deposit was formed in a sedimentary environment where highly alkaline (high pH) hydrothermal solutions also took part in borate precipitation process.</p>

				<title>Coal fire mapping of East Basuria Colliery, Jharia coalfield using vertical derivative technique of magnetic data</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0165-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study deals with the coal fire mapping of East Basuria Colliery, Jharia coalfield, India, using the magnetic method. It is based on the fact that rise in temperature would result significant changes in magnetic susceptibility and thermo-remanent magnetization (TRM) of the overlying rocks. Magnetism increases slowly with the rise of temperature until the Curie temperature. Generally, rock/overburden loses magnetization and becomes paramagnetic due to heating to Curie temperature, which results with significant reduction in magnetic susceptibility. However, magnetism increases significantly after cooling below the Curie temperature. Several data processing methods such as diurnal correction, reduction to pole (RTP), first and second vertical derivatives have been used for analysis of magnetic data and their interpretation. It is observed that the total magnetic field intensity anomaly of the area varies approximately from 44850 to 47460 nT and the residual magnetic anomaly varies approximately from −1323 to 1253 nT. The range of the magnetic anomaly after RTP is approximately 1050–1450 nT. About 20 low magnetic anomaly zones have been identified associated with active coal fire regions and 11 high magnetic anomaly zones have been identified associated with non-coal fire regions using vertical derivative techniques.</p>

				<title>Favourable uranium–phosphate exploration trends guided by the application of statistical factor analysis technique on the aerial gamma spectrometric data in Syrian desert (Area-1), Syria</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0203-0216</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A scored lithological map including 10 radiometric units is established through applying factor analysis approach to aerial spectrometric data of Area-1, Syrian desert, which includes Ur, eU, eTh, K%, eU/eTh, eU/K%, and eTh/K%. A model of four rotated factors F1, F2, F3, and F4 is adapted for representing 234,829 data measured points in Area-1, where 86% of total data variance is interpreted. A geological scored pseudo-section derived from the lithological scored map is established and analyzed in order to show the possible stratigraphic and structural traps for uranium occurrences associated with phosphate deposits in the studied Area-1. These identified traps presented in this paper need detailed investigation and must be necessarily followed and checked by ground validations and subsurface well logging, in order to locate the anomalous uranium occurrences and explore with more confidence and certitude their characteristics as a function of depth.</p>
