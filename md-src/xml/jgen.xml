				<title>Stationary-State Mutagenesis in <i>Escherichia coli</i>: a Model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stationary-phase mutagenesis in nondividing <i>E. coli</i> cells exposed to a nonlethal stress was, a few years ago, claimed to be a likely case of a Lamarckian mechanism capable of producing exclusively useful mutations in a directed manner. After a heated debate over the last decade it now appears to involve a Darwinian mechanism that generates a transient state of hypermutagenesis, operating on a large number of sites spread over the entire genome, at least in a proportion of the resting cells. Most of the studies that clarified this position were on the reversion of a frameshift mutation present in a <i>lacI -- lacZ</i> fusion in <i>E. coli</i> strain FC40. Several groups have extensively examined both the sequence changes associated with these reversions and the underlying genetic requirements. On the basis of our studies on the genomic sequence analysis, we recently proposed a model to explain the specific changes associated with the reversion hotspots. Here we propose a more detailed version of this model that also takes into account the observed genetic requirements of stationary-state mutagenesis. Briefly, G:T/U mismatches produced at methylatable cytosines are preferentially repaired in nondividing cells by the very short patch mismatch repair (VSPMR) mechanism which is itself mutagenic and can produce mutations in very short stretches located in the immediate vicinity of these cytosine methylation sites. This mechanism requires a homologous or homeologous strand invasion step and an error-prone DNA synthesis step and is dependent on RecA, RecBCD and a DNA polymerase. The process is initiated near sequences recognized by Dcm and Vsr enzymes and further stimulated if these sequences are a part of CHI or CHI-like sequences, but a double-strand-break-dependent recombination mediated by the RecBCD pathways proposed by others seems to be nonessential. The strand transfer step is proposed to depend on RecA, RuvA, RuvB and RuvC and is opposed by RecG and MutS. The model also gives interesting insights into the evolution of the <i>E. coli</i> genome.</p>

				<title>Conditions for the Trivers-Willard Hypothesis to be Valid: a Minimal Population-Genetic Model</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0009-0015</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The very insightful Trivers-Willard hypothesis, proposed in the early 1970s, states that females in good physiological condition are more likely to produce male offspring when the variance of reproductive success among males is high. The hypothesis has inspired a number of studies over the last three decades aimed at its experimental verification, and many of them have found adequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations, on the other hand, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model for describing the Trivers¬±Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly complex. The present study is aimed at using a minimal population-genetic model to explore one specific scenario, namely how is the preference for a male offspring by females in good condition altered when ùëî, the proportion of such females in the population, changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the proportion of such females in good condition is low in the population, i.e. for low values of ùëî, the Trivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment strategy. This holds true up to $g_\mathrm{max}$, a critical value of ùëî, above which the two strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily decreases as ùëî increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed males attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced, the TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of the TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance of the physiological condition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not large, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the difference increases. However, beyond a critical value of the difference, the TW strategy is found to be less and less likely to succeed as the difference becomes larger. Possible reasons for these effects are discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>During a study of deletions of Y-chromosomal DNA in infertile males, sY116, a Y-linked STS, showed different electrophoretic mobilities in three males, two infertile and one fertile. A study of this STS among 35 other normal males showed that this locus is polymorphic. sY116 has a poly A-rich stretch whose instability appears to be the most likely cause of this polymorphism. The possible usefulness of sY116 polymorphism in the detection of subtle genome-wide instabilities in some types of cancer is discussed.</p>

				<title>A spectrum of genes expressed during early stages of rice panicle and flower development</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0025-0032</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To unravel gene expression patterns during rice inflorescence development, particularly at early stages of panicle and floral organ specification, we have characterized random cloned cDNAs from developmental-stage-specific libraries. cDNA libraries were constructed from rice panicles at the stage of branching and flower primordia specification or from panicles undergoing floral organogenesis. Partial sequence analysis and expression patterns of some of these random cDNA clones from these two rice panicle libraries are presented. Sequence comparisons with known DNA sequences in databases reveal that approximately sixtyeight per cent of these expressed rice genes show varying degrees of similarity to genes in other species with assigned functions. In contrast, thirtytwo per cent represent uncharacterized genes. cDNAs reported here code for potential rice homologues of housekeeping molecules, regulators of gene expression, and signal transduction molecules. They comprise both single-copy and multicopy genes, and genes expressed differentially, both spatially and temporally, during rice plant development. New rice cDNAs requiring specific mention are those with similarity to <i>COP1</i>, a regulator of photomorphogenesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>; sequence-specific DNA binding plant proteins like <i>AP2</i>-domain-containing factors; genes that specify positional information in shoot meristems like leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptor kinases; regulators of chromatin structure like Polycomb domain protein; and also proteins induced by abiotic stresses.</p>

				<title>The <i>p10</i> gene of <i>Bombyx mori</i> nucleopolyhedrosis virus encodes a 7.5-kDa protein and is hypertranscribed from a TAAG motif</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0033-0040</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In baculovirus-based high-level expression of cloned foreign genes, the viral very late gene promoters of <i>polyhedrin (polh)</i> and <i>p10</i> are extensively exploited. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the <i>p10</i> gene from a local isolate of <i>Bombyx mori</i> nucleopolyhedrosis virus (BmNPV). The gene harbours a 213-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 70 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 7.5 kDa. The BmNPV <i>p10</i> showed deletion of a single A at +210 nucleotide compared to the prototype baculovirus, <i>Autographa californica</i> multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), <i>p10</i> gene, resulting in a translational frameshift to generate a termination codon and consequently a truncated polypeptide instead of the 10-kDa protein. This protein P7.5 from BmNPV has a putative leucine zipper dimerization motif towards the N-terminal end and the central nuclear disintegration domain but the carboxy-terminal domain implicated in protein association for fibrillar structure formation is absent. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>p10</i> is highly conserved among baculoviruses and the BmNPV strains are more closely related to AcMNPV than other baculoviruses. The transcription of <i>p10</i> is regulated in a temporal manner, reaching maximal levels by 72 h post-infection. RNAase protection and primer extension analysis mapped the transcription start sites at $-70$ and $-71$ nt with respect to the ATG, within the conserved baculovirus late gene motif T\underline{AA}G. The upstream region showed complete homology to the strong promoter of the AcMNPV <i>p10</i>, suggesting that this promoter from BmNPV could also be exploited for high-level expression of cloned foreign genes in silkworm cells or larvae.</p>

				<title>Congruence of genomic and ethnolinguistic affinities among five tribal populations of Madhya Pradesh (India)</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0041-0046</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh is home to a large number of tribal populations of diverse linguistic and ethnic backgrounds. With a view to examining how well genomic affinities among tribal populations of this state correspond with their ethnic and linguistic affinities, we analysed DNA samples of individuals drawn from five tribes with diverse, but reasonably well-documented, ethnohistorical and linguistic backgrounds. Each DNA sample was scored at 16 biallelic DNA marker loci. On the basis of these data, genomic affinities among these populations were estimated. We have found an extremely good correspondence between the genomic and ethnolinguistic affinities.</p>

				<title>An improved procedure of mapping a quantitative trait locus via the EM algorithm using posterior probabilities</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0047-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mapping a locus controlling a quantitative genetic trait (e.g. blood pressure) to a specific genomic region is of considerable contemporary interest. Data on the quantitative trait under consideration and several codominant genetic markers with known genomic locations are collected from members of families and statistically analysed to estimate the recombination fraction, ùúÉ, between the putative quantitative trait locus and a genetic marker. One of the major complications in estimating ùúÉ for a quantitative trait in humans is the lack of haplotype information on members of families. We have devised a computationally simple two-stage method of estimation of ùúÉ in the absence of haplotypic information using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the first stage, parameters of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) are estimated on the basis of data of a sample of unrelated individuals and a Bayes's rule is used to classify each parent into a QTL genotypic class. In the second stage, we have proposed an EM algorithm for obtaining the maximum-likelihood estimate of ùúÉ based on data of informative families (which are identified upon inferring parental QTL genotypes performed in the first stage). The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether, instead of using genotypically `classified' data of parents, the use of posterior probabilities of QT genotypes of parents at the second stage yields better estimators. We show, using simulated data, that the proposed procedure using posterior probabilities is statistically more efficient than our earlier classification procedure, although it is computationally heavier.</p>

					<p>It is shown that partial phenotypic suppression of two ochre mutations (<i>argE3</i> and <i>lacZU118</i>) and an amber mutation (in <i>argE</i>) by sublethal concentrations of streptomycin in an <i>rpsL<sup>+</sup></i> (streptomycin-sensitive) derivative of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain AB1157 greatly enhances their adaptive mutability under selection.

				<title>Negative regulation of <i>Ultrabithorax</i> expression by <i>engrailed</i> is required for proper specification of wing development in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0061-0070</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In both vertebrates and invertebrates, homeotic selector genes confer morphological differences along the antero-posterior axis. However, insect wing development is independent of all homeotic gene functions, reflecting the ground plan of an ancestral pterygote, which bore wings on all segments. Dipteran insects such as <i>Drosophila</i> are characterized by a pair of wings in the mesothoracic segment. In all other segments, wing development is essentially repressed by different homeotic genes, although in the metathorax they are modified into a pair of halteres. This necessitates that during development all homeotic genes are to be maintained in a repressed state in wing imaginal discs. In this report we show that</p> 
					<ol>
						<li>the function of the segment polarity <i>gene engrailed</i> (en) is critical to keep the homeotic selector gene <i>Ultrabithorax</i> (<i>Ubx</i>) repressed in wing imaginal discs,</li>
						<li>normal levels of En in the posterior compartment of haltere discs, however, are not enough to completely repress <i>Ubx</i>, and</li>
						<li>the repression of <i>Ubx</i> by <i>en</i> is independent of Hedgehog signalling through which the long-range signalling of <i>en</i> is mediated during wing development.</li> 
					</ol>
					<p>Finally we provide evidence for a possible mechanism by which en represses <i>Ubx</i>. On the basis of these results we propose that <i>en</i> has acquired two independent functions during the evolution of dorsal appendages. In addition to its well-known function of conferring posterior fate and inducing long-range signalling to pattern the developing appendages, it maintains wing fate by keeping <i>Ubx</i> repressed.</p>

					<p>Three transgenic cotton varieties (lines) were chosen for the study of inheritance and segregation of foreign Bt (<i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> toxin) and <i>tfdA</i> genes in cotton. The transformed cotton varieties CCRI 30 and NewCott 33B expressing the Bt <i>cryIA</i> gene, and cotton line TFD expressing the <i>tfdA</i> gene were crossed with CCRI 19, CCRI 12 and Lumian 6.

					</ol>
					<p>Both resistance characters were governed by a single dominant nuclear gene, and were not affected by cytoplasm. Our data support the conclusion that foreign traits encoded by single genes are inherited and expressed in Mendelian fashion in cotton.

				<title>Expression of the gene for large subunit of m-calpain is elevated in skeletal muscle from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0077-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Calpain is an intracellular nonlysosomal protease involved in essential regulatory or processing functions of the cell, mediated by physiological concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, in an environment of abnormal intracellular calcium, such as that seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), calpain is suggested to cause degeneration of muscle owing to enhanced activity. To test whether the reported increase in calpain activity in DMD results from <i>de novo</i> synthesis of the protease, we have assessed the quantitative changes in mRNA specific for m-calpain. mRNA isolated from DMD and control muscle was analysed by dot blot hybridization using a cDNA probe for the large subunit of m-calpain. Compared to control a four-fold increase in specific mRNAwas observed in dystrophic muscle. This enhanced expression of the m-calpain gene in dystrophic condition suggests that the reported increase in m-calpain activity results from <i>de novo</i> synthesis of protease and underlines the important role of m-calpain in DMD.</p>

				<title>Identification of four genes involved in suppression of the pre-mRNA splicing defect in the <i>sng1-1/rhp6<sup>-</sup></i> mutant of fission yeast</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0083-0090</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Apart from the global regulators of silencing in the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, namely <i>swi6, clr1, clr2, clr3, clr4</i> and <i>rik1</i>, the DNA repair gene <i>rhp6</i> plays a unique role in mating-type silencing. Recently, we showed that <i>sng1-1</i>, a mutation in the 5&#8242; splice junction of the second intron of the <i>rhp6</i> gene, leads to derepression of both the silent loci <i>mat2</i> and <i>mat3</i> in switching background. To address the mechanism of <i>rhp6</i> in silencing, we have isolated several extragenic suppressors of the <i>sng1-1/rhp6<sup>-</sup></i> mutation. These suppressors fall into four complementation groups and are referred to as suppressor of <i>rhp6: sur1, sur2, sur3</i> and <i>sur4</i>. Interestingly, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of the <i>rhp6</i> transcript shows that in contrast to about &#62; 50% level of unspliced <i>rhp6</i> pre-mRNA in the <i>sng1-1/rhp6<sup>-</sup></i> mutant, there is a restoration of normal splicing to varying degrees in the suppressors. The <i>sur2</i> gene belongs to the AAA-ATPase family of proteins, with maximum homology to the SIN1-associated protein SAP1 of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We propose that <i>sur2</i>, along with <i>sur1, sur3</i> and <i>sur4</i>, may play an as yet uncharacterized role in pre-mRNA splicing.</p>

				<title>Isolation of a <i>cdc28</i> mutation that abrogates the dependence of S phase on completion of M phase of the budding yeast cell cycle</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0091-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have isolated a mutation in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisisae CDC28</i> gene that allows <i>cdc13</i> cells, carrying damaged DNA, to continue with the cell division cycle. While <i>cdc13</i> mutant cells are arrested as large-budded cells at the nonpermissive temperature 37&#176;C, the <i>cdc13 cdc28</i> double mutant culture showed cells with one or more buds, most of which showed apical growth. The additional buds emerged without the intervening steps of nuclear division and cell separation. We suggest that the <i>cdc28</i> mutation abrogates a checkpoint function and allows cells with damaged or incompletely replicated DNA an entry to another round of cell cycle and bypasses the mitotic phase of the cell cycle.</p>

				<title>Meiosis and speciation: a study in a speciating <i>Mus terricolor</i> complex</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0105-0111</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The three chromosomal species of the <i>Mus terricolor</i> complex possess $2n = 40$ chromosomes. We show that their karyotypes differ in stable heterochromatin variations fixed in homozygous condition as prominent short arms in auto-somes 1, 3 and 6. The three chromosomal species exhibit a high incidence of polymorphisms for Robertsonian fusions and pericentric inversions. Breeding experiments and histological analysis of testis show that heterozygosity for pericentric inversions and Robertsonian fusions had no effect on fertility. Meiotic analysis shows normal overall progression of meiosis in the heterozygotes, which is consistent with their normal gametogenesis. Nevertheless, both the inversion and fusion heterozygotes had undergone some alterations in the regular process of homologous synapsis, and it appeared that certain features of the meiotic system circumvented the potential negative effects of these polymorphic chromosomal rearrangements. The results indicate that the attributes of the meiotic system in a given organism could modulate the potential of a chromosomal rearrangement as reproductive barrier. The meiotic modulation hypothesis offers an explanation for the contradictory effects of the similar kinds of chromosomal mutations reported in different species.</p>

				<title>Characterization of newly established colorectal cancer cell lines: correlation between cytogenetic abnormalities and allelic deletions associated with multistep tumorigenesis</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0113-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have established a series of 20 colorectal cancer cell lines and performed cytogenetic and RFLP analyses to show that the recurrent genetic abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 5, 17 and 18 associated with multistep tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer, and frequently detected as recurrent abnormalities in primary tumours, are also retained in long-term established cell lines. Earlier studies by us and other investigators showed that allelic losses of chromosomes 1 and 17 in primary colorectal cancers predicted poorer survival for the patients $(P = 0.03)$. We utilized the cell lines to identify specific chromosomal sites or gene(s) on chromosomes 1 and 17 which confer more aggressive phenotype. Cytogenetic deletions of chromosome 1p were detected in 14 out of the 20 (70%) cell lines, whereas allelic deletions for 1p using polymorphic markers were detected in 13 out of 18 (72%) informative cell lines for at least one polymorphic marker. We have performed Northern blotting, immunohistochemical staining (p53 mRNA, protein) and RFLP analysis using several probes including p53 and nm23. RFLP analysis using a total of seven polymorphic markers located on 17p and 17q arms showed allelic losses around the <i>p53</i> locus in 16 out of the 20 cell lines (80%), four of which were losses of the <i>p53</i> locus itself. In addition, seven cell lines (out of nine informative cases) also showed losses of the <i>nm23</i> gene, four with concurrent losses of the <i>p53</i> locus, while the remaining three were homozygous. In addition, five out of seven cell lines with <i>nm23</i> deletions were derived from hepatic metastatic tumours, and one cell line was obtained from recurrent tumour. A comparison between allelic deletions of 1p and functional loss of <i>nm23</i> gene revealed a close association between these two events in cell lines derived from hepatic metastasis. Following immunohistochemical staining, nine out of the twenty cell lines showed high levels (25‚Äì80%) of mutant p53, four showed intermediate levels (&#60; 20%), and seven had undetectable levels of the protein. Of these seven, four showed complete absence of mRNA. Of the remaining three cell lines one showed aberrant mRNA due to germline rearrangement of the <i>p53</i> gene, whereas in two cell lines normal levels of mRNA were present. Nineteen of the 20 cell lines had normal germline configurations for the <i>p53</i> gene, while one showed a rearrangement. These data suggest that functional loss of <i>p53</i> and <i>nm23</i> genes accomplished by a variety of mechanisms may be associated with poor prognosis and survival. In addition, concurrent deletions of chromosome regions 17p, 17q and 1p were closely associated with high-stage hepatic metastatic disease. These cell lines with well-characterized genetic alterations and known clinical history provide an invaluable source of material for various biological and clinical studies relating to multistep colorectal tumorigenesis.</p>

				<title>Understanding protein‚Äìprotein interactions by genetic suppression</title>
				<feature>Review article</feature>
				<page>0125-0129</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein‚Äìprotein interactions influence many cellular processes and it is increasingly being felt that even a weak and remote interplay between two subunits of a protein or between two proteins in a complex may govern the fate of a particular biochemical pathway. In a bacterial system where the complete genome sequence is available, it is an arduous task to assign function to a large number of proteins. It is possible that many of them are peripherally associated with a cellular event and it is very difficult to probe such interaction. However, mutations in the genes that encode such proteins (primary mutations) are useful in these studies. Isolation of a suppressor or a second-site mutation that restores the phenotype abolished by the primary mutation could be an elegant yet simple way to follow a set of interacting proteins. Such a reversion site need not necessarily be geometrically close to the primary mutation site.</p>

				<title>Evolution of faster development does not lead to greater fluctuating asymmetry of sternopleural bristle number in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Both strong directional selection and faster development are thought to destabilize development, giving rise to greater fluctuating asymmetry (FA), although there is no strong empirical evidence supporting this assertion. We compared FA in sternopleural bristle number in four populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> successfully selected for faster development from egg to adult, and in four control populations. The fraction of perfectly symmetric individuals was higher in the selected populations, whereas the FA levels did not differ significantly between selected and control populations, clearly indicating that directional selection for faster development has not led to increased FA in sternopleural bristle number in these populations. This may be because:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>development time and FA are uncorrelated,</li> 
						<li>faster development does result in FA, but selection has favoured developmentally stable individuals that can develop fast and still be symmetrical, or</li>
						<li>the increased fraction of symmetric individuals in the selected populations is an artifact of reduced body size.</li> 
					</ol>
					<p>Although we cannot discriminate among these explanations, our results suggest that the relationship between development time, FA and fitness may be far more subtle than often thought.</p>

				<title>Accelerated molecular evolution of insect orthologues of <i>ERG28/C14orf1</i>: a link with ecdysteroid metabolism?</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0017-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have analysed the evolution of <i>ERG28/C14orf1</i>, a gene coding for a protein involved in sterol biosynthesis. While primary sequence of the protein is well conserved in all organisms able to synthesize sterols <i>de novo</i>, strong divergence is noticed in insects, which are cholesterol auxotrophs. In spite of this virtual acceleration, our analysis suggests that the insect orthologues are evolving today at rates similar to those of the remaining members of the family. A plausible way to explain this acceleration and subsequent stabilization is that Erg28 plays a role in at least two different pathways. Discontinuation of the cholesterogenesis pathway in insects allowed the protein to evolve as much as the function in the other pathway was not compromised.</p>

				<page>0023-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variation at four minisatellite loci D1S7, D4S139, D5S110 and D17S79 in three predominant population groups of eastern India, namely Brahmin, Kayastha and Garo, are reported in this study. The Brahmin and Kayastha are of Indo-Caucasoid origin while the Garo community represents the Indo-Mongoloid ethnic group. The methodology employed comprised generation of <i>Hae</i>III-restricted fragments of isolated DNA, Southern blotting, and hybridization using chemiluminescent probes MS1, pH30, LH1 and V1 for the four loci. All four loci were highly polymorphic in the population groups. Heterozygosity values for the four loci ranged between 0.68 and 0.95. Neither departure from Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg expectations nor evidence of any association across alleles among the selected loci was observed. The gene differentiation value among the loci is moderate $(G_{\text{ST}} = 0.027)$. A neighbour-joining tree constructed on the basis of the generated data shows very low genetic distance between the Brahmin and Kayastha communities in relation to the Garo. Our results based on genetic distance analysis are consistent with results of earlier studies based on serological markers and linguistic as well as morphological affiliations of these populations and their Indo-Caucasoid and Indo-Mongoloid origin. The minisatellite loci studied here were found to be not only useful in showing significant genetic variation between the populations but also to be suitable for human identity testing among eastern Indian populations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Daunorubicin and its derivative doxorubicin are antitumour anthracycline antibiotics produced by <i>Streptomyces peucetius</i>. In this study we report isolation of stable mutants of <i>S. peucetius</i> blocked in different steps of the daunorubicin biosynthesis pathway. Mutants were screened on the basis of colony colour since producer strains are distinctively coloured on agar plates. Different mutants showed accumulation of aklaviketone, ùúñ-rhodomycinone, maggiemycin or 13-dihydrocarminomycin in their culture filtrates. These results indicate that the mutations in these isolates affect steps catalysed by <i>dnrE</i> (mutants SPAK and SPMAG), <i>dnrS</i> (SPFS and SPRHO) and <i>doxA</i> (SPDHC) gene products.</p>

				<title>Evidence for dominant suppression of repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) in crosses with the wild-isolated <i>Neurospora crassa</i> strains Sugartown and Adiopodoume-7</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0055-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A convenient assay to score repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) in <i>Neurospora</i> employs the <i>erg-3</i> locus as a mutagenesis target. Using this assay we screened 132 wild-isolated <i>Neurospora crassa</i> strains for ability to dominantly suppress RIP. RIP was exceptionally inefficient in crosses with the wild isolates Sugartown (P0854) and Adiopodoume-7 (P4305), thereby suggesting the presence of dominant RIP suppressors in these strains. In other experiments, we found no evidence for dominant RIP suppression by the <i>Spore killer</i> haplotypes <i>Sk-2</i> and <i>Sk-3</i>.</p>

				<title>ùêæ-selection, ùõº-selection, effectiveness, and tolerance in competition: density-dependent selection revisited</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0063-0075</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the <i>Drosophila</i> literature, selection for faster development and selection for adapting to high density are often confounded, leading, for example, to the expectation that selection for faster development should also lead to higher competitive ability. At the same time, results from experimental studies on evolution at high density do not agree with many of the predictions from classical density-dependent selection theory. We put together a number of theoretical and empirical results from the literature, and some new experimental results on <i>Drosophila</i> populations successfully subjected to selection for faster development, to argue for a broader interpretation of density-dependent selection. We show that incorporating notions of ùõº-selection, and the division of competitive ability into effectiveness and tolerance components, into the concept of density-dependent selection yields a formulation that allows for a better understanding of the empirical results. We also use this broader formulation to predict that selection for faster development in <i>Drosophila</i> should, in fact, lead to the correlated evolution of decreased competitive ability, even though it does lead to the evolution of greater efficiency and higher population growth rates at high density when in monotypic culture.</p>

				<title>Body size and mating success in <i>Drosophila willistoni</i> are uncorrelated under laboratory conditions</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0077-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mating activity and wing length were investigated in the F<sub>1</sub> progeny of <i>Drosophila willistoni</i> females collected in the field to examine any possible relationship between body size and mating success. The flies were observed in a mating chamber under laboratory conditions. No significant differences in wing length were observed between copulating and noncopulating flies, and there was no significant correlation between wing length and copulation latency for both males and females. These results therefore suggest that the commonly accepted view that large body size is positively correlated with mating success in <i>Drosophila</i> does not always hold true. The results support the view that the extent of environmentally induced variation in body size may be an important factor in determining whether an association between body size and mating success is observed in <i>Drosophila</i> species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We report novel findings on the cytogenetic location, functional complexity and maternal and germline roles of the <i>stambh A</i> locus of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. <i>stmA</i> is localized to polytene bands 44D1.2 on 2R. <i>stmA</i> mutations are of two types: temperature-sensitive (ts) adult and larval paralytic or unconditional embryonic or larval lethal. Twelve alleles reported in this study fall into two intragenic complementing groups suggesting that <i>stmA</i> is a complex locus with more than one functional domain. Some unconditional embryonic lethal alleles show a ‚Äòneurogenic‚Äô phenotype of cuticle loss accompanied by neural hypertrophy. It is shown that embryos of ts paralytic alleles also show mild neural hypertrophy at permissive temperatures while short exposure to heat induces severe cuticle loss in these embryos. <i>stmA</i> exerts a maternal influence over heat-induced cuticle loss. Unconditional embryonic lethal alleles of <i>stmA</i> are also germline lethal.</p>

				<title>Male sterility associated with overexpression of the noncoding $hsr\omega$ gene in cyst cells of testis of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0097-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Of the several noncoding transcripts produced by the $hsr\omega$ gene of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the nucleus-limited &#62; 10-kb hsrùúî-n transcript colocalizes with heterogeneous nuclear RNA binding proteins (hnRNPs) to form fine nucleoplasmic omega speckles. Our earlier studies suggested that the noncoding hsrùúî-n transcripts dynamically regulate the distribution of hnRNPs in active (chromatin bound) and inactive (in omega speckles) compartments. Here we show that a P transposon insertion in this gene‚Äôs promoter (at ‚Äì 130 bp) in the $hsr\omega^{05241}$ enhancer-trap line had no effect on viability or phenotype of males or females, but the insertion-homozygous males were sterile. Testes of $hsr\omega^{05241}$ homozygous flies contained nonmotile sperms while their seminal vesicles were empty. RNA : RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization showed that the somatic cyst cells in testes of the mutant male flies contained significantly higher amounts of hsrùúî-n transcripts, and unlike the characteristic fine omega speckles in other cell types they displayed large clusters of omega speckles as typically seen after heat shock. Two of the hnRNPs, viz. HRB87F and Hrp57A, which are expressed in cyst cells, also formed large clusters in these cells in parallel with the hsrùúî-n transcripts. A complete excision of the P transposon insertion restored male fertility as well as the fine-speckled pattern of omega speckles in the cyst cells. The <i>in situ</i> distribution patterns of these two hnRNPs and several other RNA-binding proteins (Hrp40, Hrb57A, S5, Sxl, SRp55 and Rb97D) were not affected by $hsr\omega$ mutation in any of the meiotic stages in adult testes. The present studies, however, revealed an unexpected presence (in wild-type as well as mutant) of the functional form of Sxl in primary spermatocytes and an unusual distribution of HRB87F along the retracting spindle during anaphase-telophase of the first meiotic division. It appears that the P transposon insertion in the promoter region causes a misregulated overexpression of $hsr\omega$ in cyst cells, which in turn results in excessive sequestration of hnRNPs and formation of large clusters of omega speckles in these cell nuclei. The consequent limiting availability of hnRNPs is likely to <i>trans</i>-dominantly affect processing of other pre-mRNAs in cyst cells. We suggest that a compromise in the activity of cyst cells due to the aberrant hnRNP distribution is responsible for the failure of individualization of sperms in $hsr\omega^{05241}$ mutant testes. These results further support a significant role of the noncoding hsrùúî-n transcripts in basic cellular activities, namely regulation of the availability of hnRNPs in active (chromatin bound) and inactive (in omega speckles) compartments.</p>

				<feature />
				<page>0111-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>More than 100 mutations have been reported till date in the rhodopsin gene in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The present study was undertaken to detect the reported rhodopsin gene point mutations in Indian retinitis pigmentosa patients. We looked for presence or absence of codon 345 and 347 mutations in exon 5 of the gene using the technique of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction by designing primers for each mutation. We have examined 100 patients from 76 families irrespective of genetic categories. Surprisingly, in our sample the very widely reported highly frequent mutations of codon 347 (P ‚Üí S/A/R/Q/L/T) were absent while the codon 345 mutation V ‚Üí M was seen in three cases in one family (autosomal dominant form) and in one sporadic case (total two families). This is the first report on codon 345 and 347 mutation in Indian retinitis pigmentosa subjects.</p>

				<title>Axial distortion as a sensor of supercoil changes: a molecular model for the homeostatic regulation of DNA gyrase</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0119-0124</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Negative supercoiling stimulates transcription of many genes. In contrast, transcription of the genes coding for DNA gyrase is subject to a novel mechanism of autoregulation, wherein relaxation of the template DNA stimulates their transcription. Since DNA gyrase is the sole supercoiling activity in the eubacterial cell, relaxation-stimulated transcription (RST) could reflect an autoregulatory mechanism to maintain supercoil levels within the cell. Extensive deletion and mutational analyses of <i>Escherichia coli gyrA</i> promoter have shown that the $-10$ region is essential for RST; however, a molecular model has proved to be elusive. We find a strong bend centre immediately downstream of the $-10$ region in the <i>gyrA</i> promoter. On the basis of analysis of various mutants in the $-10$ region, we propose a model where axial distortion acts as a sensor of topological changes in DNA. Our model is consistent with earlier data with <i>E. coli gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB</i> promoters. We also extrapolate the model to explain the phenomenon of RST of <i>gyr</i> promoters in other organisms and contrast it with promoters induced by supercoiling.</p>

				<title>High-resolution analysis of Y-chromosomal polymorphisms reveals signatures of population movements from Central Asia and West Asia into India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0125-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linguistic evidence suggests that West Asia and Central Asia have been the two major geographical sources of genes in the contemporary Indian gene pool. To test the nature and extent of similarities in the gene pools of these regions we have collected DNA samples from four ethnic populations of northern India, and have screened these samples for a set of 18 Y-chromosome polymorphic markers (12 unique event polymorphisms and six short tandem repeats). These data from Indian populations have been analysed in conjunction with published data from several West Asian and Central Asian populations. Our analyses have revealed traces of population movement from Central Asia and West Asia into India. Two haplogroups, HG-3 and HG-9, which are known to have arisen in the Central Asian region, are found in reasonably high frequencies (41.7% and 14.3% respectively) in the study populations. The ages estimated for these two haplogroups are less in the Indian populations than those estimated from data on Middle Eastern populations. A neighbour-joining tree based on Y-haplogroup frequencies shows that the North Indians are genetically placed between the West Asian and Central Asian populations. This is consistent with gene flow from West Asia and Central Asia into India.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Polymorphic allelic variants of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5, as well as of stromal-derived factor-1 SDF-1, the ligand for the chemokine receptor CXCR4, are known to have protective effects against HIV-1 infection and to be involved with delay in disease progression. We have studied the DNA polymorphisms at the loci that encode these proteins in 525 healthy individuals without any history of HIV-1 infection from 11 diverse populations of Andhra Pradesh, South India. The two protective alleles <i>SDF-1-3&#8242;A</i> and <i>CCR2-64I</i> at the SDF-1 and CCR2 loci, respectively, are present in all populations studied, although their frequencies differ considerably across populations (from 17% to 35% for the <i>SDF-1-3&#8242;A</i> allele, and from 3% to 17% for <i>CCR2-64I</i>). In contrast the <i>CCR5-ùõ•32</i> allele is observed only in three populations (Yamani, Pathan and Kamma), all in low frequencies (i.e. 1% to 3%). The mean number of mutant alleles (for the three loci together) carried by each individual varies from 0.475 (in Vizag Brahmins) to 0.959 (in Bohra Muslims). The estimated relative hazard values for the populations, computed from the three-locus genotype data, are comparable to those from Africa and Southeast Asia, where AIDS is known to be widespread.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Oryza malampuzhaensis</i> Krish. <i>et</i> Chand. ($2n = 4x = 48$; Poaceae, <i>Oryza</i>) is endemic to Western Ghats, South India, and shows a highly localized distribution over a small geographical area in this region. This is the most poorly understood taxon in genus <i>Oryza</i> and is often misidentified as <i>O. officinalis</i> owing to their close morphology. We assessed the nature and distribution of genetic variation among 11 populations of <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i> using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The analysis revealed low genetic variation in <i>O. malampuzhaensis.</i> Cluster analysis of pairwise genetic distances of populations revealed three distinct clusters and the grouping of populations largely corresponded to their geographical proximity. Restricted gene flow and a geography-dependent differentiation were evident among populations. The altitude-influenced differences in ecological factors among the natural habitats of the populations seem to be the cause of the geography-dependent differentiation. Genetically isolated smaller populations and a narrow genetic base in <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i> point to its vulnerability to genetic drift and genetic depauperation. Thus <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i> appears to be under the threat of extinction and needs to be conserved by use of suitable methods. The present study also identified molecular markers diagnostic for <i>O. malampuzhaensis</i>.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of the genetic variability of 13 microsatellite markers in native Indian pigs</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0149-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analysed polymorphism of 13 microsatellites in two Indian domesticated pig types (North Indian and Northeast Indian). Heterozygosity, polymorphism information content, and probability of identity of two random individuals were calculated for all microsatellites in both types. The number of alleles observed at a locus varied between five and 12. The evaluated microsatellites exhibited a very high heterozygosity and polymorphism information content. The probability of identity of two random individuals from different populations taking into account all the 13 microsatellites was as low as 3.51 &#215; 10<sup>-19</sup>. On the basis of these results, we propose that these microsatellite markers may be used with reliability for studying the genetic diversity and for identification of individuals in Indian pig types.</p>

				<title>Cloning and characterization of an insecticidal crystal protein gene from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subspecies <i>kenyae</i></title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0005-0011</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A sporulating culture of <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subsp. <i>kenyae</i> strain HD549 is toxic to larvae of lepidopteran insect species such as <i>Spodoptera litura, Helicoverpa armigera</i> and <i>Phthorimaea operculella</i>, and a dipteran insect, <i>Culex fatigans</i>. A 1.9-kb DNA fragment, PCR-amplified from HD549 using <i>cryII</i>-gene-specific primers, was cloned and expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. The recombinant protein produced 92% mortality in first-instar larvae of <i>Spodoptera litura</i> and 86% inhibition of adult emergence in <i>Phthorimaea operculella</i>, but showed very low toxicity against <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>, and lower mortality against third-instar larvae of dipteran insects <i>Culex fatigans, Anopheles stephensi</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. The sequence of the cloned crystal protein gene showed almost complete homology with a mosquitocidal toxin gene from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> var. <i>kurstaki</i>, with only five mutations scattered in different regions. Amino acid alignment with different insecticidal crystal proteins using the MUTALIN program suggested presence of the conserved block 3 region in the sequence of this protein. A mutation in codon 409 of this gene that changes a highly conserved phenylalanine residue to serine lies in this block.</p>

				<title><i>RPE65</i> gene: multiplex PCR and mutation screening in patients from India with retinal degenerative diseases</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0019-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We used multiplex PCR followed by sequencing to screen for mutations in the 14 exons of the <i>RPE65</i> gene in early-childhood-onset autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) and Leber‚Äôs congenital amaurosis (LCA) patients. The RPE65 protein is believed to play an important role in the metabolism of vitamin A in the visual cycle and mutations identified in the gene could have implications for vitamin A-based therapeutic intervention. We were able to identify a homozygous mutation (AAT ‚Üí AAG) in exon 9 in an arRP patient and a heterozygous missense transversion (AAT ‚Üí AAG) also in exon 9 of an LCA patient. We also identified a polymorphism in exon 10 (GAG ‚Üí GAA) in an arRP as well as an LCA patient. Mutation screening would be greatly facilitated by multiplex PCR which could cut down costs, labour and time involved. The nucleotide changes observed in this study could be <i>de novo</i>. Though a larger study has been undertaken, from the preliminary results it appears that in India the <i>RPE65</i> gene seems to be less involved in causation of LCA.</p>

				<title>Annotation and BAC/PAC localization of nonredundant ESTs from drought-stressed seedlings of an <i>indica</i> rice</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0025-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To decipher the genes associated with drought stress response and to identify novel genes in rice, we utilized 1540 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for functional annotation and mapping to rice genomic sequences. These ESTs were generated earlier by 3&#8242;-end single-pass sequencing of 2000 cDNA clones from normalized cDNA libraries constructed from drought-stressed seedlings of an <i>indica</i> rice. A rice UniGene set of 1025 transcripts was constructed from this collection through the BLASTN algorithm. Putative functions of 559 nonredundant ESTs were identified by BLAST similarity search against public databases. Putative functions were assigned at a stringency E value of 10<sup>-6</sup> in BLASTN and BLASTX algorithms. To understand the gene structure and function further, we have utilized the publicly available finished and unfinished rice BAC/PAC (BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; PAC, P1 artificial chromosome) sequences for similarity search using the BLASTN algorithm. Further, 603 nonredundant ESTs have been mapped to BAC/PAC clones. BAC clones were assigned by a homology of above 95% identity along 90% of EST sequence length in the aligned region. In all, 700 ESTs showed rice EST hits in GenBank. Of the 325 novel ESTs, 128 were localized to BAC clones. In addition, 127 ESTs with identified putative functions but with no homology in IRGSP (International Rice Genome Sequencing Program) BAC/PAC sequences were mapped to the Chinese WGS (whole genome shotgun contigs) draft sequence of the rice genome. Functional annotation uncovered about a hundred candidate ESTs associated with abiotic stress in rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i> that were previously reported based on microarray analysis and other studies. This study is a major effort in identifying genes associated with drought stress response and will serve as a resource to rice geneticists and molecular biologists.</p>

				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0059-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous disease and an important cause of blindness in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. In an attempt to identify the disease locus in families with the recessive form of the disease, we used the approach of screening for homozygosity by descent in offspring of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous families with RP. Microsatellite markers closely flanking 21 known candidate genes for RP were genotyped in parents and affected offspring to determine whether there was homozygosity at these loci that was shared by affected individuals of a family. This screening approach may be a rapid preliminary method to test known loci for possible cosegregation with disease.</p>

				<title>Candidate gene polymorphisms among North Indians and their association with schizophrenia in a case‚Äìcontrol study</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0065-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Knowledge of candidate gene polymorphisms in a population is useful for a variety of gene‚Äìdisease association studies, particularly for some complex traits. A number of candidate genes, a majority of them from the monoaminergic pathway in the brain, have been very popular in association studies with schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder. In this study diallelic/multiallelic polymorphisms in some dopaminergic, serotonergic and membrane-phospholipid-related genes have been evaluated in a control population recruited from North India. Association, if any, of these allelic variants with schizopherenia has been tested using a case‚Äìcontrol approach. The case data have been taken from our published family-based association studies in schizophrenia. Of the eight genes tested in this study, association with schizophrenia was observed for only two gene polymorphisms, one in the promoter region of the serotonin 2A receptor gene and the other in the tryptophan hydroxylase gene. One new allele for the dopamine transporter gene (with eight repeats, 570-bp size), not reported in any population so far, has been identified in one individual in our sample. The data generated in this study, besides providing a normative background for various disease association studies, are a significant contribution to the population-specific genome database, a currently growing requirement.</p>

				<title>Mobile genetic elements in protozoan parasites</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0073-0086</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mobile genetic elements, by virtue of their ability to move to new chromosomal locations, are considered important in shaping the evolutionary course of the genome. They are widespread in the biological kingdom. Among the protozoan parasites several types of transposable elements are encountered. The largest variety is seen in the trypanosomatids‚Äî<i>Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi</i> and <i>Crithidia fasciculata</i>. They contain elements that insert site-specifically in the spliced-leader RNA genes, and others that are dispersed in a variety of genomic locations. <i>Giardia lamblia</i> contains three families of transposable elements. Two of these are subtelomeric in location while one is chromosome-internal. <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> has an abundant retrotransposon dispersed in the genome. Nucleotide sequence analysis of all the elements shows that they are all retrotransposons, and, with the exception of one class of elements in <i>T. cruzi</i>, all of them are non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons. Although most copies have accumulated mutations, they can potentially encode reverse transcriptase, endonuclease and nucleic-acid-binding activities. Functionally and phylogenetically they do not belong to a single lineage, showing that retrotransposons were acquired early in the evolution of protozoan parasites. Many of the potentially autonomous elements that encode their own transposition functions have nonautonomous counterparts that probably utilize the functions in trans. In this respect these elements are similar to the mammalian LINEs and SINEs (long and short interspersed DNA elements), showing a common theme in the evolution of retrotransposons. So far there is no report of a DNA transposon in any protozoan parasite. The genome projects that are under way for most of these organisms will help understand the evolution and possible function of these genetic elements.</p>

				<title>The power and statistical behaviour of allele-sharing statistics when applied to models with two disease loci</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0099-0103</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have evaluated the power for detecting a common trait determined by two loci, using seven statistics, of which five are implemented in the computer program SimWalk2, and two are implemented in GENEHUNTER. Unlike most previous reports which involve evaluations of the power of allele-sharing statistics for a single disease locus, we have used a simulated data set of general pedigrees in which a two-locus disease is segregating and evaluated several non-parametric linkage statistics implemented in the two programs. We found that the power for detecting linkage using the $S_{\text{all}}$ statistic in GENEHUNTER (GH, version 2.1), implemented as statistic ùê∏ in SimWalk2 (version 2.82), is different in the two. The ùëÉ values associated with statistic ùê∏ output by SimWalk2 are consistently more conservative than those from GENEHUNTER except when the underlying model includes heterogeneity at a level of 50% where the ùëÉ values output are very comparable. On the other hand, when the thresholds are determined empirically under the null hypothesis, $S_{\text{all}}$ in GENEHUNTER and statistic ùê∏ have similar power.</p>

				<title>Extreme nuclear disproportion and constancy of enzyme activity in a heterokaryon of <i>Neurospora crassa</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0001-0006</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heterokaryons of <i>Neurospora crassa</i> were generated by transformation of multinucleate conidia of a <i>histidine-3</i> auxotroph with <i>his-3<sup>+</sup></i> plasmid. In one of the transformants, propagated on a medium with histidine supplementation, a gradual but drastic reduction occurred in the proportion of prototrophic nuclei that contained an ectopically integrated <i>his-3<sup>+</sup></i> allele. This response was specific to histidine. The reduction in prototrophic nuclei was confirmed by several criteria: inoculum size test, hyphal tip analysis, genomic Southern analysis, and by visual change in colour of the transformant incorporating genetic colour markers. Construction and analyses of three-component heterokaryons revealed that the change in nuclear ratio resulted from interaction of auxotrophic nucleus with prototrophic nucleus that contained an ectopically integrated <i>his-3<sup>+</sup></i> gene, but not with prototrophic nucleus that contained <i>his-3<sup>+</sup></i> gene at the normal chromosomal location. The growth rate of heterokaryons and the activity of histidinol dehydrogenase‚Äîthe protein encoded by the <i>his-3<sup>+</sup></i> gene‚Äîremained unchanged despite prototrophic nuclei becoming very scarce. The results suggest that not all nuclei in the coenocytic fungal mycelium may be active simultaneously, the rare active nuclei being sufficient to confer the wild-type phenotype.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>By employing a procedure that combines ELISA and photoacoustic spectroscopy, we have examined the content of 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) in DNA of individuals who differed from one another in the number of X chromosomes in their genomes. The results show that the human inactive X chromosome (Xi) contains very high amounts of this modified nucleotide. We estimate that in the 46,XX female there is more m<sup>5</sup>C in Xi (&#8764;3.6 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup>) than in all the remaining chromosomes put together (&#8764;2.1 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup>). Our results also suggest that nearly one-fifth of all cytosines in Xi are methylated and that, in addition to CpG methylation, there is extensive non-CpG methylation as well.</p>

				<title>Absence of <i>GABRA1</i> Ala322Asp mutation in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy families from India</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0017-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An Ala322Asp mutation in the <i>GABRA1</i> gene was recently reported to be responsible for causing the autosomal dominant (AD) form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) in a French-Canadian family. To study if JME families from India exhibiting the AD mode of inheritance carry the Ala322Asp mutation, we examined 35 unrelated JME-affected individuals from such families for the Ala322Asp mutation in <i>GABRA1</i>. Ala322Asp mutation was not observed in any of these JME-affected individuals, suggesting that this mutation is unlikely to be a predominant mutation involved in causation of epilepsy. To evaluate the possibility of other mutation(s) in and around <i>GABRA1</i> that may predispose to JME, we compared the allele frequencies at two marker loci, D5S2118 and D5S422, flanking <i>GABRA1</i>, in probands and 100 matched population controls. One of the allele frequencies at D5S422 shows a significant difference between the cases and controls (ùúí<sup>2</sup> = 11.44, d.f. = 1, $P = 0.0007$), suggesting genetic association between JME and genes located in the proximity of the DNA marker.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We isolated a 4301-bp cDNA from a human foetal brain cDNA library by high-throughput cDNA sequencing. It encodes a protein of 341 amino acids, which shows 69% identity with the human kinase CLIK1 (AAL99353), which was suggested to be the CLP-36 interacting kinase. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the putative kinase may interact with PDZ and LIM domain proteins. Therefore the protein and its cDNA were named ‚ÄòPDLIM1 interacting kinase 1 like‚Äô (PDIK1L; nomenclature approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee). Ensembl Genome Browser located <i>PDIK1L</i> to human chromosome 1p35.3. It spans about 13.7 kb and consists of four exons and three introns. Multiple-tissue cDNA panel PCR revealed that the gene is expressed widely in human tissues: liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus and prostate. The protein appears to be localized to the nucleus.</p>

				<title>Ethnic variations of a retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (<i>RB1</i>) polymorphism in eight Asian populations</title>
				<feature />

				<abstract>
					<p>An A ‚Üí G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at nucleotide 153,104 in the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (<i>RB1</i>) at 13q14 was previously reported to be present only in Asians. In this study, we determined the distribution of this SNP in normal Southeast Asian populations (Chinese, Malay, Javanese, Thai, Filipino), in South Asian populations (Bangladeshi, Pakistani Pushtun and Indian) and in Chinese retinoblastoma cases and control subjects. The <i>RB1</i> SNP was present in all populations at an overall frequency of &#8804; 0.18. Heterozygosity was higher in the Southeast Asian groups (0.14‚Äì0.34) than in the South Asian groups (Bangladeshi and Indian) (0.04‚Äì0.06). Significant differences in allele frequencies were found between the two population groups. Interestingly, our Pakistani population comprised of ethnic Pushtuns from northwest Pakistan was significantly different from the neighbouring Bangladeshi and Indian populations. No significant difference was found between Chinese case patients and control subjects. This <i>RB1</i> SNP appears to be an ethnic variant prevalent in Southeast Asian populations and may be useful for studying <i>RB1</i> inheritance by pedigree analysis.</p>

				<title>Molecular-genetic analysis of two cases with retinoblastoma: benefits for disease management</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0039-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effective counselling and management of retinoblastoma families using genetic information is presently practised in many parts of the world. We studied histopathological, chromosomal and molecular-genetic data of two retinoblastoma patients from India. The two patients, one with bilateral and the other with unilateral retinoblastoma, underwent complete ophthalmic examination, cytogenetic study, retinoblastoma gene (<i>RB1</i>) mutational analysis and <i>RB1</i> promoter region methylation screening. In the bilateral retinoblastoma patient deletion of chromosome region 13q14 in peripheral blood lymphocytes and a hemizygous novel 8-bp deletion in exon 4 of <i>RB1</i> in tumour sample were observed. In the unilaterally affected patient CGA to TGA transition protein truncation mutations were observed in exons 8 and 14 of <i>RB1</i>.</p>

				<title>What have two decades of laboratory life-history evolution studies on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> taught us?</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0045-0076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A series of laboratory selection experiments on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> over the past two decades has provided insights into the specifics of life-history tradeoffs in the species and greatly refined our understanding of how ecology and genetics interact in life-history evolution. Much of what has been learnt from these studies about the subtlety of the microevolutionary process also has significant implications for experimental design and inference in organismal biology beyond life-history evolution, as well as for studies of evolution in the wild. Here we review work on the ecology and evolution of life-histories in laboratory populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, emphasizing how environmental effects on life-history-related traits can influence evolutionary change. We discuss life-history tradeoffs‚Äîmany unexpected‚Äîrevealed by selection experiments, and also highlight recent work that underscores the importance to life-history evolution of cross-generation and cross-life-stage effects and interactions, sexual antagonism and sexual dimorphism, population dynamics, and the possible role of biological clocks in timing life-history events. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of typical selection experiments, and how these limitations might be transcended in the future by a combination of more elaborate and realistic selection experiments, developmental evolutionary biology, and the emerging discipline of phenomics.</p>

				<title>Genetic variability of sexual size dimorphism in a natural population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: an isofemale-line approach</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0079-0088</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most animal species exhibit sexual size dimorphism (SSD). SSD is a trait difficult to quantify for genetical purposes since it must be simultaneously measured on two kinds of individuals, and it is generally expressed either as a difference or as a ratio between sexes. Here we ask two related questions: What is the best way to describe SSD, and is it possible to conveniently demonstrate its genetic variability in a natural population? We show that a simple experimental design, the isofemale-line technique (full-sib families), may provide an estimate of genetic variability, using the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We consider two SSD indices, the female‚Äìmale difference and the female/male ratio. For two size-related traits, wing and thorax length, we found that both SSD indices were normally distributed. Within each family, the variability of SSD was estimated by considering individual values in one sex (the female) with respect to the mean value in the other sex (the male). In a homogeneous sample of 30 lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, both indices provided similar intraclass correlations, on average 0.21, significantly greater than zero but lower than those for the traits themselves: 0.50 and 0.36 for wing and thorax length respectively. Wing and thorax length were strongly positively correlated within each sex. SSD indices of wing and thorax length were also positively correlated, but to a lesser degree than for the traits themselves. For comparative evolutionary studies, the ratio between sexes seems a better index of SSD since it avoids scaling effects among populations or species, permits comparisons between different traits, and has an unambiguous biological significance. In the case of <i>D. melanogaster</i> grown at 25&#176;C, the average female/male ratios are very similar for the wing (1.16) and the thorax (1.15), and indicate that, on average, these size traits are 15‚Äì16% longer in females.</p>

				<title>Mild heat stress at a young age in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> leads to increased Hsp70 synthesis after stress exposure later in life</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0089-0094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a number of animal species it has been shown that exposure to low levels of stress at a young age has a positive effect on stress resistance later in life, and on longevity. The positive effects have been attributed to the activation of defence/cleaning systems (heat shock proteins (Hsps), antioxidases, DNA repair) or to effects of a changed metabolic rate, or both. We investigated the effect of mild stress exposures early in life on Hsp70 synthesis after a harder stress exposure later in life in five isofemale lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Female flies were either exposed to repeated bouts of mild heat stress (3 h at 34&#176;C) at a young age (days 2, 4 and 6 post-eclosion) or held under standard laboratory conditions. At 16 and 32 days of adult age, respectively, flies were exposed to a high temperature treatment known to induce Hsp70 in the investigated species (1 h at 37&#176;¬∫C). Thereafter, the inducible Hsp70 levels were measured. Our data show a tendency towards increased Hsp70 synthesis with increased age for both ‚Äòmild stress‚Äô and ‚Äòno stress‚Äô flies. Moreover, the results show that flies exposed to mild stress at a young age synthesized more Hsp70 upon induction, compared to control flies, and that this difference was accentuated at 32 days compared to 16 days of age. Thus, bouts of mild heat stress at a young age impact on the physiological stress response system later in life. This may be caused by an increased ability to react to future stresses. Alternatively, the mild stress exposure at a young age may actually have caused cellular damages increasing the need for Hsp70 levels after stress exposure later in life. The importance of an Hsp70 upregulation (throughout life) in explaining the phenomenon of hormesis is discussed, together with alternative hypotheses, and suggestions for further studies.</p>

				<title>Quantitative-genetic analysis of wing form and bilateral asymmetry in isochromosomal lines of <i>Drosophila subobscura</i> using Procrustes methods</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0095-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often used as a measure of underlying developmental instability (DI), motivated by the idea that morphological variance is maladaptive. Whether or not DI has evolutionary potential is a highly disputed topic, marred by methodological problems and fuzzy prejudices. We report here some results from an ongoing study of the effects of karyotype, homozygosity and temperature on wing form and bilateral asymmetry using isochromosomal lines of <i>Drosophila subobscura</i>. Our approach uses the recently developed methodologies in geometric morphometrics to analyse shape configurations of landmarks within the standard statistical framework employed in studies of bilateral asymmetries, and we have extended these methods to partition the individual variation and the variation in asymmetries into genetic and environmental causal components. The analyses revealed temperature-dependent expression of genetic variation for wing size and wing shape, directional asymmetry (DA) of wing size, increased asymmetries at suboptimal temperature, and a transition from FA to DA in males as a result of increase in the rearing temperature. No genetic variation was generally detected for FA in our samples, but these are preliminary results because no crosses between lines were carried out and, therefore, the contribution of dominance was not taken into account. In addition, only a subset of the standing genetic variation was represented in the experiments.</p>

				<title>Molecular population genetics of the ùõΩ-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0115-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have investigated nucleotide polymorphism at the ùõΩ-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster including the <i>Est-6</i> gene and ùúì<i>Est-6</i> putative pseudogene in four samples of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> derived from natural populations of southern Africa (Zimbabwe), Europe (Spain), North America (USA: California), and South America (Venezuela). A complex haplo-type structure is revealed in both <i>Est-6</i> and ùúì<i>Est-6</i>. Total nucleotide diversity is twice in ùúì<i>Est-6</i> as in <i>Est-6</i>; diversity is higher in the African sample than in the non-African ones. Strong linkage disequilibrium occurs within the ùõΩ-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster in non-African samples, but not in the African one. Intragenic gene conversion events are detected within <i>Est-6</i> and, to a much greater extent, within ùúì<i>Est-6</i>; intergenic gene conversion events are rare. Tests of neutrality with recombination are significant for the ùõΩ-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster in the non-African samples but not significant in the African one. We suggest that the demographic history (bottleneck and admixture of genetically differentiated populations) is the major factor shaping the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism in the ùõΩ-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster. However there are some ‚Äòfootprints‚Äô of directional and balancing selection shaping specific distribution of nucleotide polymorphism within the cluster. Intergenic epistatic selection between <i>Est-6</i> and ùúì<i>Est-6</i> may play an important role in the evolution of the ùõΩ-<i>esterase</i> gene cluster preserving the putative pseudogene from degenerative destruction and reflecting possible functional interaction between the functional gene and the putative pseudogene. <i>Est-6</i> and ùúì<i>Est-6</i> may represent an indivisible intergenic complex (‚Äòintergene‚Äô) in which each single component (<i>Est-6</i> or ùúì<i>Est-6</i>) cannot separately carry out the full functional role.</p>

				<title>The devil in the details of life-history evolution: instability and reversal of genetic correlations during selection on <i>Drosophila</i> development</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0133-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The evolutionary relationships between three major components of Darwinian fitness, development rate, growth rate and preadult survival, were estimated using a comparison of 55 distinct populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> variously selected for age-specific fertility, environmental-stress tolerance and accelerated development. Development rate displayed a strong net negative evolutionary correlation with weight at eclosion across all selection treatments, consistent with the existence of a size-versus-time tradeoff between these characters. However, within the data set, the magnitude of the evolutionary correlation depended upon the particular selection treatments contrasted. A previously proposed tradeoff between preadult viability and growth rate was apparent only under weak selection for juvenile fitness components. Direct selection for rapid development led to sharp reductions in both growth rates and viability. These data add to the mounting results from experimental evolution that illustrate the sensitivity of evolutionary correlations to</p>

					<p>Instability, disappearance and reversal of patterns of genetic covariation often occur over short evolutionary time frames and as the direct product of selection, rather than some stochastic process.

				<title>The contribution of ancestry, chance, and past and ongoing selection to adaptive evolution</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0147-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relative contributions of ancestry, chance, and past and ongoing selection to variation in one adaptive (larval feeding rate) and one seemingly nonadaptive (pupation height) trait were determined in populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> adapting to either low or high larval densities in the laboratory. Larval feeding rates increased rapidly in response to high density, and the effects of ancestry, past selection and chance were ameliorated by ongoing selection within 15‚Äì20 generations. Similarly, in populations previously kept at high larval density, and then switched to low larval density, the decline of larval feeding rate to ancestral levels was rapid (15‚Äì20 generations) and complete, providing support for a previously stated hypothesis regarding the costs of faster feeding in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. Variation among individuals was the major contributor to variation in pupation height, a trait that would superficially appear to be nonadaptive in the environmental context of the populations used in this study because it did not diverge between sets of populations kept at low versus high larval density for many generations. However, the degree of divergence among populations ($F_{\text{ST}}$) for pupation height was significantly less than expected for a selectively neutral trait, and we integrate results from previous studies to suggest that the variation for pupation height among populations is constrained by stabilizing selection, with a flat, plateau-like fitness function that, consequently, allows for substantial phenotypic variation within populations. Our results support the view that the genetic imprints of history (ancestry and past selection) in outbreeding sexual populations are typically likely to be transient in the face of ongoing selection and recombination. The results also illustrate the heuristic point that different forms of selection‚Äîfor example directional versus stabilizing selection‚Äîacting on a trait in different populations may often not be due to differently shaped fitness functions, but rather due to differences in how the fitness function maps onto the actual distribution of phenotypes in a given population. We discuss these results in the light of previous work on reverse evolution, and the role of ancestry, chance, and past and ongoing selection in adaptive evolution.</p>

				<title>Hybridization, transgressive segregation and evolution of new genetic systems in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0163-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Introgressive hybridization facilitates incorporation of genes from one species into the gene pool of another. Studies on long-term effects of introgressive hybridization in animal systems are sparse. <i>Drosophila nasuta</i> ($2n = 8$) and <i>D. albomicans</i> ($2n = 6$)‚Äîa pair of allopatric, morphologically almost identical, cross-fertile members of the <i>nasuta</i> subgroup of the <i>immigrans</i> species group‚Äîconstitute an excellent system to analyse the impact of hybridization followed by transgressive segregation of parental characters in the hybrid progeny. Hybrid populations of <i>D. nasuta</i> and <i>D. albomicans</i> maintained for over 500 generations in the laboratory constitute new recombinant hybrid genomes, here termed cytoraces. The impact of hybridization, followed by introgression and transgressive segregation, on chromosomal constitution and karyotypes, some fitness parameters, isozymes, components of mating behaviour and mating preference reveals a complex pattern of interracial divergence among parental species and cytoraces. This assemblage of characters in different combinations in a laboratory hybrid zone allows us to study the emergence of new genetic systems. Here, we summarize results from our ongoing studies comparing these hybrid cytoraces with the parental species, and discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the evolution of new genetic systems.</p>

				<title>Thermal adaptation in <i>Drosophila serrata</i> under conditions linked to its southern border: unexpected patterns from laboratory selection suggest limited evolutionary potential</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0179-0189</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To investigate the ability of <i>Drosophila serrata</i> to adapt to thermal conditions over winter at the species southern border, replicate lines from three source locations were held as discrete generations over three years at either 19&#176;C (40 generations) or temperatures fluctuating between 7&#176;C and 18&#176;C (20 generations). Populations in the fluctuating environment were maintained either with an adult 0&#176;C cold shock or without a shock. These conditions were expected to result in temperature-specific directional selection for increased viability and productivity under both temperature regimes, and reduced development time under the fluctuating-temperature regime. Selection responses of all lines were tested under both temperature regimes after controlling for carry-over effects by rearing lines in these environments for two generations. When tested in the 19&#176;C environment, lines evolving at 19&#176;C showed a faster development time and a lower productivity relative to the other lines, while cold shock reduced development time and productivity of all lines. When tested in the fluctuating environment, productivity of the 7‚Äì18&#176;C lines selected with a cold shock was relatively lower than that of lines selected without a shock, but this pattern was not observed in the other populations. Viability and body size as measured by wing length were not altered by selection or cold shock, although there were consistent effects of source population on wing length. These results provide little evidence for temperature-specific adaptation in <i>D. serrata</i>‚Äîalthough the lines had diverged for some traits, these changes were not consistent with a priori predictions. In particular, there was no evidence for life-history changes reflecting adaptation to winter conditions at the southern border. The potential for <i>D. serrata</i> to adapt to winter conditions may therefore be limited.</p>

				<title>Variation in adult life history and stress resistance across five species of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature />
				<page>0191-0205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dry weight at eclosion, adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, lipid and carbohydrate content at eclosion, and starvation and desiccation resistance at eclosion were assayed on a long-term laboratory population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and one recently wild-caught population each of four other species of <i>Drosophila</i>, two from the <i>melanogaster</i> and two from the <i>immigrans</i> species group. The relationships among trait means across the five species did not conform to expectations based on correlations among these traits inferred from selection studies on <i>D. melanogaster</i>. In particular, the expected positive relationships between fecundity and size/lipid content, lipid content and starvation resistance, carbohydrate (glycogen) content and desiccation resistance, and the expected negative relationship between lifespan and fecundity were not observed. Most traits were strongly positively correlated between sexes across species, except for fractional lipid content and starvation resistance per microgram lipid. For most traits, there was evidence for significant sexual dimorphism but the degree of dimorphism did not vary across species except in the case of adult lifespan, starvation resistance per microgram lipid, and desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate. Overall, <i>D. nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>D. sulfurigaster neonasuta</i> (<i>immigrans</i> group) were heavier at eclosion than the <i>melanogaster</i> group species, and tended to have somewhat higher absolute lipid content and starvation resistance. Yet, these two <i>immigrans</i> group species were shorter-lived and had lower average daily fecundity than the <i>melanogaster</i> group species. The smallest species, <i>D. malerkotliana</i> (<i>melanogaster</i> group), had relatively high daily fecundity, intermediate lifespan and high fractional lipid content, especially in females. <i>D. ananassae</i> (<i>melanogaster</i> group) had the highest absolute and fractional carbohydrate content, but its desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate was the lowest among the five species. In terms of overall performance, the laboratory population of <i>D. melanogaster</i> was clearly superior, under laboratory conditions, to the other four species if adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, average daily fecundity, and absolute starvation and desiccation resistance are considered. This finding is contrary to several recent reports of substantially higher adult lifespan and stress resistance in recently wild-caught flies, relative to flies maintained for a long time in discrete-generation laboratory cultures. Possible explanations for these apparent anomalies are discussed in the context of the differing selection pressures likely to be experienced by <i>Drosophila</i> populations in laboratory versus wild environments.</p>

				<title>Latitudinal clines in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: body size, allozyme frequencies, inversion frequencies, and the insulin-signalling pathway</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0207-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many latitudinal clines exist in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: in adult body size, in allele frequency at allozyme loci, and in frequencies of common cosmopolitan inversions. The question is raised whether these latitudinal clines are causally related. This review aims to connect data from two very different fields of study, evolutionary biology and cell biology, in explaining such natural genetic variation in <i>D. melanogaster</i> body size and development time. It is argued that adult body size clines, inversion frequency clines, and clines in allele frequency at loci involved in glycolysis and glycogen storage are part of the same adaptive strategy. Selection pressure is expected to differ at opposite ends of the clines. At high latitudes, selection on <i>D. melanogaster</i> would favour high larval growth rate at low temperatures, and resource storage in adults to survive winter. At low latitudes selection would favour lower larval critical size to survive crowding, and increased male activity leading to high male reproductive success. Studies of the insulin-signalling pathway in <i>D. melanogaster</i> point to the involvement of this pathway in metabolism and adult body size. The genes involved in the insulin-signalling pathway are associated with common cosmopolitan inversions that show latitudinal clines. Each chromosome region connected with a large common cosmopolitan inversion possesses a gene of the insulin transmembrane complex, a gene of the intermediate pathway and a gene of the TOR branch. The hypothesis is presented that temperate <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations have a higher frequency of a ‚Äòthrifty‚Äô genotype corresponding to high insulin level or high signal level, while tropical populations possess a more ‚Äòspendthrift‚Äô genotype corresponding to low insulin or low signal level.</p>

				<title>Refinement of the locus for non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2)</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0035-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Non-syndromic X-linked deafness is a rare form of genetic deafness in humans accounting for a small proportion of all hereditary hearing loss. Different clinical forms of non-syndromic X-linked deafness have been described, and most of these have been mapped. Here, we report a Chinese family affected by a congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss. All phenotypes of this family are clinically compatible with non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2). A maximum two-point Lod score of 2.32 was obtained at marker <i>DXS6797</i> (ùúÉ = 0.00). Recombinants define a region of 4.3 cm flanked by markers <i>DXS6799</i> and <i>GATA172D05</i>. This region overlaps the previously reported DFN2 region by 2.0 cm.</p>

				<title>Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in the Anatolian Peninsula (Turkey)</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0039-0048a</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Throughout human history, the region known today as the Anatolian peninsula (Turkey) has served as a junction connecting the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia, and, thus, has been subject to major population movements. The present study is undertaken to obtain information about the distribution of the existing mitochondrial D-loop sequence variations in the Turkish population of Anatolia. A few studies have previously reported mtDNA sequences in Turks. We attempted to extend these results by analysing a cohort that is not only larger, but also more representative of the Turkish population living in Anatolia. In order to obtain a descriptive picture for the phylogenetic distribution of the mitochondrial genome within Turkey, we analysed mitochondrial D-loop region sequence variations in 75 individuals from different parts of Anatolia by direct sequencing. Analysis of the two hypervariable segments within the noncoding region of the mitochondrial genome revealed the existence of 81 nucleotide mutations at 79 sites. The neighbour-joining tree of Kimura‚Äôs distance matrix has revealed the presence of six main clusters, of which H and U are the most common. The data obtained are also compared with several European and Turkic Central Asian populations.</p>

				<title>Deciphering diversity in populations of various linguistic and ethnic affiliations of different geographical regions of India: analysis based on 15 microsatellite markers</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0049-0063</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The extent of genetic polymorphism at fifteen autosomal microsatellite markers in 54 ethnically, linguistically and geographically diverse human populations of India was studied to decipher intrapopulation diversity. The parameters used to quantify intrapopulation diversity were average allele diversity, average heterozygosity, allele range (base pairs), and number of alleles. Multilocus genotype frequencies calculated for selected populations were utilized for testing conformity with the assumption of Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium. The exact test values, after Bonferroni correction, showed significant deviation amongst Gowda (vWA, Penta E); Dhangar, Satnami and Gounder (D8S1179); Hmar (FGA); Kuki and Balti (vWA) groups. Relatively low number of alleles and allelic diversity (base-pairs size) had been observed in populations of central India as compared with southern and northern regions of the country. The communities of Indo-Caucasoid ethnic origin and Indo-European linguistic family (Kshatriya of Uttar Pradesh) showed highest allelic diversity, as well as rare alleles, not reported in any other Indian populations. Analysis based on average heterozygosity was also found to be lowest among the populations of central India (0.729) and highest among the populations from north (0.777) and west (0.784) regions of the country, having Indo-Caucasoid ethnic origin and Austro-Asiatic linguistic affiliation. The maximum power of discrimination (85%‚Äì89%) had been observed at loci FGA, Penta E, D18S51 and D21S11, suggested high intrapopulation diversity in India. Genetic diversity revealed by STR markers was consistent with the known demographic histories of populations. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrated that the intrapopulation diversity is not only present at the national level, but also within smaller geographical regions of the country. This is the first attempt to understand the extent of diversity within populations of India at such a large scale at genomic level.</p>

				<title>Allelic structure and distribution of 103 STR loci in a Southern Tunisian population</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0065-0071</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genotypes of 103 short tandem repeat (STR) markers distributed at an average of 40 cM intervals throughout the genome were determined for 40 individuals from the village of BirEl Hfai (BEH). This village of approximately 31.000 individuals is localized in the south-west of Tunisia. The allele frequency distributions in BEH were compared with those obtained for individuals in the CEPH (Centre d‚ÄôEtude du Polymorphisme Humain) data using a Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov two-sample test. Fourteen out of the 103 markers (13.2%) showed significant differences ($P\lt 0.05$) in distribution between the two populations. Population heterogeneity in BEH was indicated by an excess of observed homozygosity deviations from Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium at 3 loci ($P\lt 0.0005$). No evidence for genotypic disequilibrium was found for any of the marker pairs. This demonstrated that in spite of a high inbreeding level in the population, few markers showed evidence for a different pattern of allelic distribution compared to CEPH.</p>

				<title>Circadian clocks and life-history related traits: is pupation height affected by circadian organization in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0073-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>D. melanogaster</i>, the observation of greater pupation height under constant darkness than under constant light has been explained by the hypothesis that light has an inhibitory effect on larval wandering behaviour, preventing larvae from crawling higher up the walls of culture vials prior to pupation. If this is the only role of light in affecting pupation height, then various light : dark regimes would be predicted to yield pupation heights intermediate between those seen in constant light and constant darkness. We tested this hypothesis by measuring pupation height under various light : dark regimes in four laboratory populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Pupation height was the greatest in constant darkness, intermediate in constant light, and the least in a light / dark regime of LD 14:14 h. The results clearly suggest that there is more to light regime effects on pupation height than mere behavioural inhibition of wandering larvae, and that circadian organization may play some role in determining pupation height, although the details of this role are not yet clear. We briefly discuss these results in the context of the possible involvement of circadian clocks in life-history evolution.</p>

				<title>Structural and functional analysis of rice genome</title>
				<feature>Review article</feature>
				<page>0079-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rice is an excellent system for plant genomics as it represents a modest size genome of 430 Mb. It feeds more than half the population of the world. Draft sequences of the rice genome, derived by whole-genome shotgun approach at relatively low coverage (4‚Äì6 X), were published and the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) declared high quality (&#62;10 X), genetically anchored, phase 2 level sequence in 2002. In addition, phase 3 level finished sequence of chromosomes 1, 4 and 10 (out of 12 chromosomes of rice) has already been reported by scientists from IRGSP consortium. Various estimates of genes in rice place the number at &#62; 50,000. Already, over 28,000 full-length cDNAs have been sequenced, most of which map to genetically anchored genome sequence. Such information is very useful in revealing novel features of macro- and micro-level synteny of rice genome with other cereals. Microarray analysis is unraveling the identity of rice genes expressing in temporal and spatial manner and should help target candidate genes useful for improving traits of agronomic importance. Simultaneously, functional analysis of rice genome has been initiated by marker-based characterization of useful genes and employing functional knock-outs created by mutation or gene tagging. Integration of this enormous information is expected to catalyze tremendous activity on basic and applied aspects of rice genomics.</p>

				<title>REML estimates of genetic parameters of sexual dimorphism for wing and thorax length in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0163-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate genetic parameters of male and female wing and thorax length in isofemale lines of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and results compared to estimates obtained earlier with the classical analysis of variance approach. As parents within an isofemale line were unknown, a total of 500 parental pedigrees were simulated and mean estimates computed. Full and half sibs were distinguished, in contrast to usual isofemale studies in which animals were all treated as half sibs and hence heritability was overestimated. Heritability was thus estimated at 0.33, 0.38, 0.30 and 0.33 for male and female wing length and male and female thorax length, respectively, whereas corresponding estimates obtained using analysis of variance were 0.46, 0.54, 0.35 and 0.38. Genetic correlations between male and female traits were 0.85 and 0.62 for wing and thorax length, respectively. Sexual dimorphism and the ratio of female to male traits were moderately heritable (0.30 and 0.23 for wing length, 0.38 and 0.23 for thorax length). Both were moderately and positively correlated with female traits, and weakly and negatively correlated with male traits. Such heritabilities confirmed that sexual dimorphism might be a fast evolving trait in <i>Drosophila.</i></p>

				<title>Genetic and genotype &#215; environment interaction effects for the content of seven essential amino acids in <i>indica</i> rice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0171-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is necessary for rice breeders to understand the genetic basis of nutrient quality traits of rice. Essential amino acids are most important in determining the nutrient quality of rice grain and can affect the health of people who depend on rice as a staple food. In view of the paucity of genetic information available on essential amino acids in <i>indica</i> rice, we estimated the genetic main effects and genotype &#215; environment (G &#215; E) interaction effects on the content of essential amino acids. Nine cytoplasmic male sterile lines as females and five restorer lines as males were introduced in a North Carolina II design across environments. Estimates of the content of the essential amino acids valine, methionine, leucine and phenylalanine showed that they were mainly controlled by genetic main effects, while the contents of threonine, cysteine and isoleucine were mainly affected by G &#215; E effects. In the case of genetic main effects, both cytoplasmic and maternal genetic effects were predominant for all essential amino acids, indicating that selection for improving essential amino acid content based on maternal performance would be more effective than that based on seeds. The total narrow-sense heritabilities were high and ranged from 0.72 to 0.83. Since general heritabilities for these essential amino acids (except for cysteine) were found to be much larger than G &#215; E interaction heritability, the improvement of content of most essential amino acids under selection would be expected under various environments. Rice varieties such as Zhenan 3, Yinchao 1, T49, 26715, 102 and 1391 should be selected as optimal parents for increasing the content of most essential amino acids, while the total genetic effects from Zhexie 2, Xieqingzao, Gangchao 1, V20, Zuo 5 and Zhenshan 97 were mainly negative and these parents could decrease the contents of most essential amino acids.</p>

				<title>Variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects in novel versus familiar environments in two <i>Drosophila</i> species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0179-0188</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Models of competitor coevolution, especially the genetic feedback hypothesis, suggest that a negative correlation between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects may be important in sustaining competitor coexistence, and can give rise to oscillatory dynamics with repeated reversals of competitive superiority. I reanalyzed previously published census data from an experiment in which populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>D. simulans</i> underwent competitive coevolution in one familiar and two novel environments, to specifically look for any evidence of a negative relationship between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates, and for any indication of short period cycling in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects. While there was considerable variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects over generations, among both populations and environments, there was no clear evidence supporting the genetic feedback hypothesis. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates were strongly positively correlated in novel environments, and uncorrelated in the familiar environment. Data from the familiar environment indicated that indices of competition of populations of the initially superior competitor, <i>D. melanogaster</i>, might be showing some cyclic behaviour, but I argue that this is likely to be transient, and not suggestive of sustained oscillatory dynamics predicted by the genetic feedback model. I discuss the results in the context of the importance of the genetic architecture of intraspecific and interspecific competitive abilities in determining the coevolutionary trajectory of competitive interactions.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0189-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Estrogen plays a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The CYP17 gene codes for the cytochrome P450c17ùõº enzyme that is involved in the estrogen biosynthesis. We aimed to investigate if CYP17 polymorphism could be used as marker to predict the susceptibility of endometriosis. Women were divided into two groups:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>severe endometriosis (n=119);</li>
						<li>non-endometriosis groups (n=128).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>A 169-bp fragment encompassing the T/C polymorphic site in 5&#8242;-untranslated promoter region (5&#8242;-UTR) of the CYP17 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, treated with restriction enzyme MspA1I, and electrophoresis. The polymorphism was divided into restriction- enzyme indigestible (T homozygote), T/C heterozygote, and digestible (C homozygote). Genotypes and allelic frequencies for this polymorphism in both groups were compared. We observed a higher but non-significant percentage of T homozygote in the endometriosis women compared with the non-endometriosis women. Proportions of T homozygote/heterozygote/C homozygote for CYP17 in both groups were:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>26.1/46.2/27.7% and</li> 
						<li>17.2/45.3/37.5% (p- value=0.131).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>T allele was related with higher susceptibility of endometriosis. T and C allele frequencies in both groups were:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>49.2/50.8%;</li>
						<li>39.8/60.2% (p- value=0.046).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Despite the CYP17* T allele appearing to be asscoiatd with a trend of increased risk of endometriosis, CYP17 5&#8242;-UTR gene polymorphism might not be a useful marker for prediction of endometriosis susceptibility.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We describe tests for detecting and locating quantitative trait loci (QTL) for traits in Hanwoo cattle. From results of a permutation test to detect QTL for marbling, we selected the microsatellite locus ILSTS035 on chromosome 6 for further analysis. ùêæ-means clustering analysis applied to five traits and nine DNA markers in ILSTS035 resulted in three cluster groups. Finally we employed the bootstrap test method to calculate confidence intervals using the resampling method to find major DNA markers. We conclude that the major markers of ILSTS035 locus on chromosome 6 of Hanwoo cattle are markers 235 bp and 266 bp.</p>

				<title>Excess of counterclockwise scalp hair-whorl rotation in homosexual men</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0251-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>While most men prefer women as their sexual partners, some are bisexual and others are homosexuals. It has been debated for a long time whether a person‚Äôs sexual preference is innate, learned, or due to a combination of both causes. It was recently discovered that the human right-versus-left-hand use preference and the direction of scalp hair-whorl rotation develop from a common genetic mechanism. Such a mechanism controls functional specialization of brain hemispheres. Whether the same mechanism specifying mental makeup influences sexual preference was determined here by comparing hair-whorl rotation in groups enriched with homosexual men with that in males at large. Only a minority of 8.2% ($n = 207$) unselected ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô group of males had counterclockwise rotation. In contrast, all three samples enriched with homosexual men exhibited highly significant ($P \lt 0.0001$), 3.6-fold excess (29.8%, $n = 272$) counterclockwise rotation. These results suggest that sexual preference may be influenced in a significant proportion of homosexual men by a biological/genetic factor that also controls direction of hair-whorl rotation.</p>

				<title>Cloning of a novel gene, <i>Cymg1</i>, related to family 2 cystatins and expressed at specific stages of mouse testis development</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0257-0263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have cloned a novel gene, <i>Cymg1</i> (GenBank accession number AY600990), from a mouse testis cDNA library. <i>Cymg1</i> is located in 2G3 of mouse chromosome 2. The cDNA includes an open reading frame that encodes 141 amino acid residues. The encoded polypeptide has a cysteine protease inhibitor domain found in the family 2 cystatins but lacks critical consensus sites important for cysteine protease inhibition. These characteristics are seen in the proteins of the CRES subfamily of the family 2 cystatins which are expressed specifically in the reproductive tract. CYMG1 protein shows 44% identity with mouse CRES and 30% identity with mouse cystatin C. Northern blot analysis showed that the <i>Cymg1</i> gene was specifically expressed in adult mouse testis. RT-PCR also showed that <i>Cymg1</i> was expressed in testis and spermatogonial cells. <i>Cymg1</i> expression level varied in the different developmental stages of mouse testis, and were coincidental with spermatogenesis and sex maturation. These results indicate that <i>Cymg1</i> may play important roles in mouse spermatogenesis and sex maturation</p>

				<title>Quantitative genetics of functional characters in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> populations subjected to laboratory selection</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0265-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>What are the genetics of phenotypes other than fitness, in outbred populations? To answer this question, the quantitative-genetic basis of divergence was characterized for outbred <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> populations that had previously undergone selection to enhance characters related to fitness. Line-cross analysis using first-generation and second-generation hybrids from reciprocal crosses was conducted for two types of cross, each replicated fivefold. One type of cross was between representatives of the ancestral population, a set of five populations maintained for several hundred generations on a two-week discrete-generation life cycle and a set of five populations adapted to starvation stress. The other type of cross was between the same set of ancestral-representative populations and another set of five populations selected for accelerated development from egg to egg. Developmental time from egg to eclosion, starvation resistance, dry body weight and fecundity at day 14 from egg were fit to regression models estimating single-locus additive and dominant effects, maternal and paternal effects, and digenic additive and dominance epistatic effects. Additive genetic variation explained most of the differences between populations, with additive maternal and cytoplasmic effects also commonly found. Both within-locus and between-locus dominance effects were inferred in some cases, as well as one instance of additive epistasis. Some of these effects may have been caused by linkage disequilibrium. We conclude with a brief discussion concerning the relationship of the genetics of population differentiation to adaptation.</p>

				<title>Exact Tandem Repeats Analyzer (E-TRA): A new program for DNA sequence mining</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0049-0054</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Exact Tandem Repeats Analyzer 1.0 (E-TRA) combines sequence motif searches with keywords such as ‚Äòorgans‚Äô, ‚Äòtissues‚Äô, ‚Äòcell lines‚Äô and ‚Äòdevelopment stages‚Äô for finding simple exact tandem repeats as well as non-simple repeats. E-TRA has several advanced repeat search parameters/options compared to other repeat finder programs as it not only accepts GenBank, FASTA and expressed sequence tags (EST) sequence files, but also does analysis of multiple files with multiple sequences. The minimum and maximum tandem repeat motif lengths that E-TRA finds vary from one to one thousand. Advanced user defined parameters/options let the researchers use different minimum motif repeats search criteria for varying motif lengths simultaneously. One of the most interesting features of genomes is the presence of relatively short tandem repeats (TRs). These repeated DNA sequences are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, distributed almost at random throughout the genome. Some of the tandem repeats play important roles in the regulation of gene expression whereas others do not have any known biological function as yet. Nevertheless, they have proven to be very beneficial in DNA profiling and genetic linkage analysis studies. To demonstrate the use of E-TRA, we used 5,465,605 human EST sequences derived from 18,814,550 GenBank EST sequences. Our results indicated that 12.44% (679,800) of the human EST sequences contained simple and non-simple repeat string patterns varying from one to 126 nucleotides in length. The results also revealed that human organs, tissues, cell lines and different developmental stages differed in number of repeats as well as repeat composition, indicating that the distribution of expressed tandem repeats among tissues or organs are not random, thus differing from the un-transcribed repeats found in genomes.</p>

				<title>Comparative studies on codon usage pattern of chloroplasts and their host nuclear genes in four plant species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0055-0062</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A detailed comparison was made of codon usage of chloroplast genes with their host (nuclear) genes in the four angiosperm species <i>Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Triticum aestivum</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The average GC content of the entire genes, and at the three codon positions individually, was higher in nuclear than in chloroplast genes, suggesting different genomic organization and mutation pressures in nuclear and chloroplast genes. The results of Nc-plots and neutrality plots suggested that nucleotide compositional constraint had a large contribution to codon usage bias of nuclear genes in <i>O. sativa, Z. mays,</i> and <i>T. aestivum</i>, whereas natural selection was likely to be playing a large role in codon usage bias in chloroplast genomes. Correspondence analysis and chi-test showed that regardless of the genomic environment (species) of the host, the codon usage pattern of chloroplast genes differed from nuclear genes of their host species by their AU-richness. All the chloroplast genomes have predominantly A- and/or U-ending codons, whereas nuclear genomes have G-, C- or U-ending codons as their optimal codons. These findings suggest that the chloroplast genome might display particular characteristics of codon usage that are different from its host nuclear genome. However, one feature common to both chloroplast and nuclear genomes in this study was that pyrimidines were found more frequently than purines at the synonymous codon position of optimal codons.</p>

				<title>Mutational analysis of the <i>BRCA1</i> gene in 30 Czech ovarian cancer patients</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0063-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ovarian cancer is one of the most severe of oncological diseases. Inherited mutations in cancer susceptibility genes play a causal role in 5‚Äì10% of newly diagnosed tumours. <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> gene alterations are found in the majority of these cases. The aim of this study was to analyse the <i>BRCA1</i> gene in the ovarian cancer risk group to characterize the spectrum of its mutations in the Czech Republic. Five overlapping fragments amplified on both genomic DNA and cDNA were used to screen for the whole protein-coding sequence of the <i>BRCA1</i> gene. These fragments were analysed by the protein truncation test (PTT) and direct sequencing. Three inactivating mutations were identified in the group of 30 Czech ovarian cancer patients: the 5382insC mutation in two unrelated patients and a deletion of exons 21 and 22 in another patient. In addition, we have found an alternatively spliced product lacking exon 5 in two other unrelated patients. The 5382insC is the most frequent alteration of the <i>BRCA1</i> gene in Central and Eastern Europe. The deletion of exons 21 and 22 affects the BRCT functional domain of the BRCA1 protein. Although large genomic rearragements are known to be relatively frequent in Western European populations, no analyses have been performed in our region yet.</p>

				<title>Marker-aided genetic divergence analysis in <i>Brassica</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0123-0130</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic divergence was evaluated in 31 breeding lines from four <i>Brassica</i> species using Mahalanobis‚Äô $D^{2}$. A new method of grouping using $D^{2}$ values was used to group the 31 lines, based on diagnostic morphological traits (called morphoqts). Isozyme variation of the individual enzymes esterase and glutamate oxaloacetate was quantified by five parameters (called isoqts) developed earlier. Grouping by the same method was also done based on the isoqts, and the grouping by isozymes was compared with that by morphoqts. Overall, there was an agreement of 73% suggesting that isoqts can be used in the choice of parents and also first stage selection of segregants in the laboratory. It was suggested that such an exercise would help to take care of season-bound and field-related problems of breeding. The new isozyme QTs, within lane variance of relative mobility and relative absorption, accounted for about 50% of the total divergence. The utility of the new method and isoqts in cost-effective breeding were highlighted.</p>

				<title>Effect of splice-site polymorphisms of the <i>TMPRSS4, NPHP4</i> and <i>ORCTL4</i> genes on their mRNA expression</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0131-0136</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic polymorphisms associated with structural changes of their gene product are important in terms of their potential relation with diseases. Therefore, in this study, splice-site variants of the transmembrane serine protease gene <i>TMPRSS4</i>, nephronophthisis gene <i>NPHP4</i>, and organic-cation transporter gene <i>ORCTL4</i>, were selected from the dbSNP single nucleotide polymorphism database as candidates to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with a structural change in their mRNA transcripts. The allele frequencies of the <i>TMPRSS4</i> c.4-7A&#62;G, <i>NPHP4</i> c.2818-2A&#62;T, and <i>ORCTL4</i> c.517-2A&#62;C polymorphisms in a Japanese population were determined to be 0.42, 0.10, and 0.27, respectively, by PCR-SSCP analysis. Next, the effect of these polymorphisms on the mode of pre-mRNA splicing was investigated by RT-PCR analysis followed by sequencing analysis. The <i>TMPRSS4</i>, <i>NPHP4</i>, and <i>ORCTL4</i> polymorphisms were associated with the production of the r.4-6_4-1ins transcript, the r.2818_2823del and r.2818_2859del transcripts, and the r.517-94_517-1ins; r.517-2a&#62;c and r.517_620del transcripts, respectively. Since the proteins encoded by all these transcripts are associated with relatively significant structural changes in the form amino acid insertion/deletion and premature termination, their functional ability may be greatly reduced. Our demonstration of structural changes in mRNA transcripts as a result of splice-site polymorphisms implies that they may be of biological significance in certain pathological conditions.</p>

				<title>Molecular phylogeny of the domesticated silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, based on the sequences of mitochondrial <i>cytochrome b</i> genes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0137-0142</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pupae from the Chinese wild mulberry silkworm, <i>Bombyx mandarina</i>, and 11 representative strains of the domesticated silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i> were selected for preparation of mitochondrial DNA. The 5&#8242;-end fragments of <i>cytochrome b</i> genes (<i>Cytb</i>) were generated by polymerase chain reaction products and sequenced directly. The homologous sequences of the Japanese <i>B. mandarina</i> and three strains of <i>B. mori</i> were from the GenBank database. The sequences of the 16 silkworm strains were analysed with DNASTAR software and a phylogenic tree was constructed using PHYLIP software. The result showed that:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The sequence divergence between the strains of <i>B. mori</i> and the Japanese <i>B. mandarina</i> was larger (5.4% ‚àº 5.8%) compared with that between strains of <i>B. mori</i> and the Chinese <i>B. mandarina</i> (0.8% ‚àº 1.9%). Analysis of clustering also showed that the sequences of <i>B. mori</i> strains and Chinese <i>B. mandarina</i> clustered into group (B group), while that of Japanese <i>B. mandarina</i> (<i>A group</i>) was outside this cluster. This may be evidence for the hypothesis that <i>B. mori</i> originated from Chinese <i>B. mandarina.</i></li> 
						<li>Among 14 strains of <i>B. mori</i>, sequence divergence was small and the most divergence was seen between strains Yanhe-1 and Chuxiong, whose sequences branched off from those of the other <i>B. mori</i> strains on the phylogenetic tree. From this and from historical records, we infer that the strains Yanhe-1 and Chuxiong originated independently from southwest China.</li>

				<title>Dissecting the correlation structure of a bivariate phenotype: common genes or shared environment?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0143-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High correlations between two quantitative traits may be either due to common genetic factors or common environmental factors or a combination of both. In this study, we develop statistical methods to extract the genetic contribution to the total correlation between the components of a bivariate phenotype. Using data on bivariate phenotypes and marker genotypes for sib-pairs, we propose a test for linkage between a common QTL and a marker locus based on the conditional cross-sib trait correlations (trait 1 of sib 1 ‚Äì trait 2 of sib 2 and conversely) given the identity-by-descent (i.b.d.) sharing at the marker locus. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed test under different trait parameters and quantitative trait distributions. An application of the method is illustrated using data on two alcohol-related phenotypes from a project on the collaborative study on the genetics of alcoholism.</p>

				<title>Homogeneity of common cosmopolitan inversion frequencies in Southeast Asian <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0173-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>East Asian <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> are known for great variation in morphological and physiological characters among populations, variation that is believed to be maintained by genetic drift. To understand the genetic properties of Asian <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations, we initiated a population genetic study of chromosome inversion polymorphisms in hitherto unanalysed population samples from Southeast (SE) Asia. We generally found a high frequency of each of the four common cosmopolitan inversions in comparison to populations from Africa, Asia, and Australia. In contrast to the great phenotypic variation among Asian populations, however, we could not detect differences in inversion frequencies among populations. Furthermore, we observed neither correlations of inversion frequencies with population latitude and longitude, nor evidence for linkage disequilibrium between different inversion loci. We propose two explanations for the observed genetic homogeneity among these SE Asian <i>D. melanogaster</i> populations:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the observed pattern simply reflects the retention of ancestral polymorphisms originating from a panmictic population that was once present on a large single landmass (Sundaland), and/or is a consequence of high recent gene flow between populations; and</li>
						<li>it is caused by selective forces (e.g. balancing selection).</li>

				<title>Is premating isolation in <i>Drosophila</i> overestimated due to uncontrolled factors?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0259-0264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sexual isolation in <i>Drosophila</i> is typically measured by multiple-choice mating tests. While many environmental variables during such tests are controlled by the researcher, there are some factors that are usually uncontrolled. We demonstrate, using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>D. pseudoobscura</i> flies, that the temperature of rearing, preadult density, and level of consanguinity, can all produce differences in mating propensity between genetically equivalent flies. These differences in mating propensity, in turn, can give rise to statistically significant results in multiple-choice mating tests, leading to positive isolation values and the artifactual inference of sexual isolation between populations. This fact agrees with a nonrandom excess of significant positive tests found in a review of the literature of <i>Drosophila</i> intraspecific mating choice. An overestimate of true cases of sexual isolation in <i>Drosophila</i> in the literature can, therefore, not be ruled out.</p>

				<title>The <i>Hsp60C</i> gene in the 25F cytogenetic region in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is essential for tracheal development and fertility</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0265-0281</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Earlier studies have shown that of the four genes (<i>Hsp60A, Hsp60B, Hsp60C, Hsp60D</i> genes) predicted to encode the conserved Hsp60 family chaperones in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the <i>Hsp60A</i> gene (at the 10A polytene region) is expressed in all cell types of the organism and is essential from early embryonic stages, while the <i>Hsp60B</i> gene (at 21D region) is expressed only in testis, being essential for sperm individualization. In the present study, we characterized the <i>Hsp60C</i> gene (at 25F region), which shows high sequence homology with the other three <i>Hsp60</i> genes of <i>D. melanogaster</i>. <i>In situ</i> hybridization of <i>Hsp60C</i>-specific riboprobe shows that expression of this gene begins in late embryonic stages (stage 14 onwards), particularly in the developing tracheal system and salivary glands; during larval and adult stages, it is widely expressed in many cell types but much more strongly in tracheae and in developing and differentiating germ cells. A P-insertion mutant (<i>Hsp60C<sup>1</sup></i>) allele with the P transposon inserted at $-251$ position of the <i>Hsp60C</i> gene promoter was generated. This early larval recessive lethal mutation significantly reduces levels of <i>Hsp60C</i> transcripts in developing tracheae and this is associated with a variety of defects in the tracheal system, including lack of liquid clearance. About 10% of the homozygotes survive as weak, shortlived and completely sterile adults. Testes of the surviving mutant males are significantly smaller, with fewer spermatocytes, most of which do not develop beyond the round spermatid stage. <i>In situ</i> and Northern hybridizations show significantly reduced levels of the <i>Hsp60C</i> transcripts in <i>Hsp60C<sup>1</sup></i> homozygous adult males. The absence of early meiotic stages in the <i>Hsp60C<sup>1</sup></i> homozygous testes contrasts with the effect of testis-specific <i>Hsp60B</i> (21D) gene, whose mutation affects individualization of sperm bundles later in spermiogenesis. In view of the specific effects in tracheal development and in early stages of spermatogenesis, it is likely that, besides its functions as a chaperone, Hsp60C may have signalling functions and may also be involved in cation transport across the developing tracheal epithelial cells.</p>

				<title>Coexistence of three different <i>Drosophila</i> species by rescheduling their life history traits in a natural population</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0283-0293</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present evidence for coexistence of three different <i>Drosophila</i> species by rescheduling their life history traits in a natural population using the same resource, at the same time and same place. <i>D. ananassae</i> has faster larval development time (DT) and faster DT(egg-fly) than other two species thus utilizing the resources at maximum at both larval and adult stages respectively. Therefore, <i>D. ananassae</i> skips the interspecific competition at preadult stage but suffers more from intraspecific competition. However, <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. biarmipes</i> have rescheduled their various life history traits to avoid interspecific competition. Differences of ranks tests for various life history traits suggest that except for DT(egg-pupa), the difference of ranks is highest for the combination of <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. ananassae</i> for all other life history traits. This difference is maintained by tradeoffs between larval development time and pupal period and between pupal period and DT(egg-pupa) in <i>D. ananassae.</i></p>

				<title>Genetic diversity and bottleneck studies in the Marwari horse breed</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0295-0301</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic diversity within the Marwari breed of horses was evaluated using 26 different microsatellite pairs with 48 DNA samples from unrelated horses. This molecular characterisation was undertaken to evaluate the problem of genetic bottlenecks also, if any, in this breed. The estimated mean (¬± s.e.) allelic diversity was 5.9 (¬± 2.24), with a total of 133 alleles. A high level of genetic variability within this breed was observed in terms of high values of mean (¬± s.e.) effective number of alleles (3.3 ¬± 1.27), observed heterozygosity (0.5306 ¬± 0.22), expected Levene‚Äôs heterozygosity (0.6612 ¬± 0.15), expected Nei‚Äôs heterozygosity (0.6535 ¬± 0.14), and polymorphism information content (0.6120 ¬± 0.03). Low values of Wright‚Äôs fixation index, $F_{\text{IS}}$ (0.2433 ¬± 0.05) indicated low levels of inbreeding. This basic study indicated the existence of substantial genetic diversity in the Marwari horse population. No significant genotypic linkage disequilibrium was detected across the population, suggesting no evidence of linkage between loci. A normal ‚ÄòL‚Äô shaped distribution of mode‚Äìshift test, non-significant heterozygote excess on the basis of different models, as revealed from Sign, Standardized differences and Wilcoxon sign rank tests as well as non-significant ùëÄ ratio value suggested that there was no recent bottleneck in the existing Marwari breed population, which is important information for equine breeders. This study also revealed that the Marwari breed can be differentiated from some other exotic breeds of horses on the basis of three microsatellite primers.</p>

				<title>Genetics of adult plant stripe rust resistance in CSP44, a selection from Australian wheat</title>
				<feature>Research Note</feature>
				<page>0337-0340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Wheat line CSP44, a selection from an Australian bread wheat cultivar Condor, has shown resistance to stripe rust in India since the last twenty years. Seedlings and adult plants of CSP44 showed susceptible infection types against stripe rust race 46S119 but displayed average terminal disease severity of 2.67 on adult plants against this race as compared to 70.33 of susceptible Indian cultivar, WL711. This suggests the presence of nonhypersensitive adult plant stripe rust resistance in the line CSP44. The evaluation of F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> generations and F<sub>6</sub> SSD families from the cross of CSP44 with susceptible wheat cultivar WL711 for stripe rust severity indicated that the resistance in CSP44 is based on two genes showing additive effect. One of these two genes is <i>Yr18</i> and the second gene is not yet described.</p>

				<title>Phenotypic plasticity of body size in a temperate population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: when the temperature‚Äìsize rule does not apply</title>
				<feature />
				<page>0009-0023</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A natural population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> in southern France was sampled in three different years and 10 isofemale lines were investigated from each sample. Two size-related traits, wing and thorax length, were measured and the wing/thorax ratio was also calculated. Phenotypic plasticity was analysed after development at seven different constant temperatures, ranging from 12&#176;C to 31&#176;C. The three year samples exhibited similar reaction norms, suggesting a stable genetic architecture in the natural population. The whole sample (30 lines) was used to determine precisely the shape of each reaction norm, using a derivative analysis. The practical conclusion was that polynomial adjustments could be used in all cases, but with different degrees: linear for the wing/thorax ratio, quadratic for thorax length, and cubic for wing length. Both wing and thorax length exhibited concave reaction norms, with a maximum within the viable thermal range. The temperatures of the maxima were, however, quite different, around 15&#176;C for the wing and 19.5&#176;C for the thorax. Assuming that thorax length is a better estimate of body size, it is not possible to state that increasing the temperature results in monotonically decreasing size (the temperature‚Äìsize rule), although this is often seen to be the case for genetic variations in latitudinal clines. The variability of the traits was investigated at two levels‚Äîwithin and between lines‚Äîand expressed as a coefficient of variation. The within-line (environmental) variability revealed a regular, quadratic convex reaction norm for the three traits, with a minimum around 21&#176;C. This temperature of minimum variability may be considered as a physiological optimum, while extreme temperatures are stressful. The between-line (genetic) variability could also be adjusted to quadratic polynomials, but the curvature parameters were not significant. Our results show that the mean values of the traits and their variance are both plastic, but react in different ways along a temperature gradient. Extreme low or high temperatures decrease the size but increase the variability. These effects may be considered as a functional response to environmental stress.</p>

				<title>Introgressive hybridization and evolution of a novel protein phenotype: glue protein profiles in the <i>nasuta‚Äìalbomicans</i> complex of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0025-0030</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glue proteins are tissue-specific proteins synthesized by larval salivary gland cells of <i>Drosophila</i>. In <i>Drosophila nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>D. n. albomicans</i> of the <i>nasuta</i> subgroup, the genes that encode the major glue protein fractions are X-linked. In the present study, these X-linked markers have been employed to trace the pattern of introgression of <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and <i>D. n. albomicans</i> genomes with respect to the major glue protein fractions in their interracial hybrids, called cytoraces. These cytoraces have inherited the chromosomes of both parents and have been maintained in the laboratory for over 400‚Äì550 generations. The analysis has revealed that cytoraces with <i>D. n. albomicans</i> X chromosome show either <i>D. n. nasuta</i> pattern or a completely novel pattern of glue protein fractions. Further, quantitative analysis also shows lack of correlation between the chromosomal pattern of inheritance and overall quantity of the major glue protein fractions in the cytoraces. Thus, in cytoraces the parental chromosomes are not just differentially represented but there is evidence for introgression even at the gene level.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have examined the molecular-phylogenetic relationships between nonmulberry and mulberry silkwormspecies that belong to the families Saturniidae, Bombycidae and Lasiocampidae using 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (<i>coxI</i>) gene sequences. Aligned nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA and <i>coxI</i> from 14 silk-producing species were used for construction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods. The tree topology on the basis of 16S rRNA supports monophyly for members of Saturniidae and Bombycidae. Weighted parsimony analysis weighted towards transversions relative to transitions (ts, tv4) for <i>coxI</i> resulted in more robust bootstrap support over unweighted parsimony and favours the 16S rRNA tree topology. Combined analysis reflected clear biogeographic pattern, and agrees with morphological and cytological data.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Karyotype structures of <i>Scenedesmus acuminatus</i> (Lagerch.) Chod. and <i>Scenedesmus pectinatus</i> Meyen are compared. The karyotype of <i>S. acuminatus</i> ($n = 5$) is described for the first time. It reveals four large metacentric and one large submetacentric chromosomes (4M + 1SM). The established karyotype differences have been helpful in clarifying the taxonomic position of these two species. The cytological analyses of other related clonal cultures suggest an evolutionary transition from <i>S. pectinatus</i> towards <i>S. regularis</i> through <i>S. pectinatus</i> f. <i>regularis</i>, which correlates with the morphological data about their variability. These results are discussed from the cytogenetic, morphological and evolutionary point of view. On the basis of the karyotypic analysis, it was confirmed that from a taxonomic point of view <i>S. pectinatus, S. acuminatus</i> and <i>S. regularis</i> are separate biological species.</p>

				<title>Genetic analyses of agronomic and seed quality traits of synthetic oilseed <i>Brassica napus</i> produced from interspecific hybridization of <i>B. campestris</i> and <i>B. oleracea</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0045-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The heritability, the number of segregating genes and the type of gene interaction of nine agronomic traits were analysed based on F<sub>2</sub> populations of synthetic oilseed <i>Brassica napus</i> produced from interspecific hybridization of <i>B. campestris</i> and <i>B. oleracea</i> through ovary culture. The nine traits‚Äîplant height, stem width, number of branches, length of main raceme, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, length of pod, seed weight per plant and 1000-seed weight‚Äîhad heritabilities of 0.927, 0.215, 0.172, 0.381, 0.360, 0.972, 0.952, 0.516 and 0.987 respectively, while the mean numbers of controlling genes for these characters were 7.4, 10.4, 9.9, 12.9, 11.5, 21.7, 20.5, 19.8 and 6.4 respectively. According to estimated coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of the traits tested, no significant gene interaction was found for plant height, stem width, number of branches, length of main raceme, number of seeds per pod and 1000-seed weight. Seed yield per plant is an important target for oilseed production. In partial correlation analysis, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and 1000-seed weight were positively correlated with seed yield per plant. On the other hand, length of pod was negatively correlated ($r = -0.69$) with seed yield per plant. Other agronomic characters had no significant correlation to seed yield per plant. In this experiment, the linear regressions of seed yield per plant and other agronomic traits were also analysed. The linear regression equation was $y = 0.074x_{8} + 1.819x_{9} + 6.72x_{12} - 60.78 (R^{2} = 0.993)$, where $x_{8}$, $x_{9}$ and $x_{12}$ represent number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and 1000-seed weight respectively. The experiment also showed that erucic acid and oil contents of seeds from F<sub>2</sub> plants were lower than those of their maternal parents. However, glucosinolate content was higher than that of the maternal plants. As for protein content, similar results were found in the F<sub>2</sub> plants and their maternal parents. It was shown that the four quality traits, i.e. erucic acid, glucosinolate, oil content, and protein content, had heritability values of 0.614, 0.405, 0.153 and 0.680 respectively.</p>

				<title>Highly conserved D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequences (Numts) in tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0107-0116</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using oligonucleotide primers designed to match hypervariable segments I (HVS-1) of <i>Panthera tigris</i> mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we amplified two different PCR products (500 bp and 287 bp) in the tiger (<i>Panthera tigris</i>), but got only one PCR product (287 bp) in the leopard (<i>Panthera pardus</i>). Sequence analyses indicated that the sequence of 287 bp was a D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequence (Numts), indicating a nuclear transfer that occurred approximately 4.8‚Äì17 million years ago in the tiger and 4.6‚Äì16 million years ago in the leopard. Although the mtDNA D-loop sequence has a rapid rate of evolution, the 287-bp Numts are highly conserved; they are nearly identical in tiger subspecies and only 1.742% different between tiger and leopard. Thus, such sequences represent molecular ‚Äòfossils‚Äô that can shed light on evolution of the mitochondrial genome and may be the most appropriate outgroup for phylogenetic analysis. This is also proved by comparing the phylogenetic trees reconstructed using the D-loop sequence of snow leopard and the 287-bp Numts as outgroup.</p>

				<title>Genetic diversity studies of Kherigarh cattle based on microsatellite markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0117-0122</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report a genetic diversity study of Kherigarh cattle, a utility draught-purpose breed of India, currently declining at a startling rate, by use of microsatellite markers recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Microsatellite genotypes were derived, and allelic and genotypic frequencies, heterozygosities and gene diversity were estimated. A total of 131 alleles were distinguished by the 21 microsatellite markers used. All the microsatellites were highly polymorphic, with mean (¬± s.e.) allelic number of 6.24 ¬± 1.7, ranging 4‚Äì10 per locus. The observed heterozygosity in the population ranged between 0.261 and 0.809, with mean (¬± s.e.) of 0.574 ¬± 0.131, indicating considerable genetic variation in this population. Genetic bottleneck hypotheses were also explored. Our data suggest that the Kherigarh breed has not experienced a genetic bottleneck in the recent past.</p>

				<title>Morphological, yield, cytological and molecular characterization of a bread wheat &#215; tritordeum F<sub>1</sub> hybrid</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0123-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The morphological, yield, cytological and molecular characteristics of bread wheat &#215; tritordeum F<sub>1</sub> hybrids ($2n = 6x = 42$; AABBDH<sup>ch</sup>) and their parents were analysed. Morphologically, these hybrids resembled the wheat parent. They were slightly bigger than both parents, had more spikelets per spike, and tillered more profusely. The hybrids are self-fertile but a reduction of average values of yield parameters was observed. For the cytological approach we used a double-target fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization performed with total genomic DNA from <i>Hordeum chilense</i> L. and the ribosomal sequence pTa71. This technique allowed us to confirm the hybrid nature and to analyse chromosome pairing in this material. Our results showed that the expected complete homologous pairing (14 bivalents plus 14 univalents) was only observed in 9.59% of the pollen mother cells (PMCs) analysed. Some PMCs presented autosyndetic pairing of H<sup>ch</sup> and A, B or D chromosomes. The average number of univalents was higher in the wheat genome (6.8) than in the H<sup>ch</sup> genome (5.4). The maximum number of univalents per PMC was 20. We only observed wheat multivalents (one per PMC) but the frequency of trivalents (0.08) was higher than that of quadrivalents (0.058). We amplified 50 RAPD bands polymorphic between the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid and one of its parents, and 31 ISSR polymorphic bands. Both sets of markers proved to be reliable for DNA fingerprinting. The complementary use of morphological and yield analysis, molecular cytogenetic techniques and molecular markers allowed a more accurate evaluation and characterization of the hybrids analysed here.</p>

				<title>Homeotic-like modification of stamens to petals is associated with aberrant mitochondrial gene expression in cytoplasmic male sterile Ogura <i>Brassica juncea</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0133-0139</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have previously reported correction of severe leaf chlorosis in the cytoplasmic male sterile Ogura (also called Ogu) <i>Brassica juncea</i> line carrying Ogura cytoplasm by plastid substitution via protoplast fusion. Two cybrids obtained from the fusion experiment, Og1 and Og2, were green and carried the plastid genome of <i>B. juncea</i> cv. RLM198. While Og1 displayed normal flower morphology comparable to that of its euplasmic <i>B. juncea</i> counterpart except for sterile anthers, Og2 retained homeotic-like floral modification of stamens to petal-like structures and several other floral deformities observed in the chlorotic (Ogu) <i>B. juncea</i> cv. RLM198 (or OgRLM). With respect to the mitochondrial genome, Og1 showed 81% genetic similarity to the fertile cultivar RLM while Og2 showed 93% similarity to OgRLM. In spite of recombination and rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes in the cybrids, expression patterns of 10 out of 11 mitochondrial genes were similar in all the three CMS lines; the only exception was <i>atp6</i>, whose expression was altered. While Og1 showed normal <i>atp6</i> transcript similar to that in RLM, in Og2 and OgRLM weak expression of a longer transcript was detected. These results suggest that the homeotic-like changes in floral patterning leading to petaloid stamens in Og2 and OgRLM may be associated with aberrant mitochondrial gene expression.</p>

				<title>Microsatellite DNA typing for assessment of genetic variability in Tharparkar breed of Indian zebu (<i>Bos indicus</i>) cattle, a major breed of Rajasthan</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0165-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study estimates genetic variability with a set of 25 microsatellite markers in a random sample of 50 animals of Tharparkar breed of Indian zebu (<i>Bos indicus</i>) cattle. Tharparkar is a dual-purpose breed, valued for its milk as well as draught utility, and is adapted to the inhospitable Thar desert conditions of Rajasthan typified by summer temperature hovering above 50&#176;C, sparse rainfall and vegetation, and scarcity of even drinking water. The observed number of alleles ranged from 4 (ETH3, ILSTS030, INRA5, INRA63 and MM8) to 11 (HEL9 and ILSTS034), with allelic diversity (average number of observed alleles per locus) of 6.20. Observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.25 (INRA63) to 0.77 (ETH10), and from 0.51 (HEL5 and HAUT27) to 0.88 (HEL9) respectively. Wide range of genetic variability supported the utility of these microsatellite loci in measurement of genetic diversity indices in other Indian cattle breeds too. Various average genetic variability measures, namely allele diversity (6.20), observed heterozygosity (0.57), expected heterozygosity (0.67) and mean polymorphism information content (0.60) values showed substantial within-breed genetic variability in this major breed of Rajasthan, despite accumulated inbreeding as reflected by high average inbreeding coefficient $(F_{\text{IS}} = 0.39)$. The Tharparkar population has not experienced a bottleneck in the recent past.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0171-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Some members of <i>hairy/Enhancer-of-split</i>-related gene (HES) family have important effects on axial mesoderm segmentation and the establishment and maintenance of the somite fringe. In fishes, the <i>her6</i> gene, a member of the HES family, is the homologue of <i>hes1</i> in mammals and chicken. In this study, the <i>her6</i> gene and its full-length cDNA from the common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) were isolated and characterized. The genomic sequence of common carp <i>her6</i> is approximately 1.7 kb, with four exons and three introns, and the full-length cDNA of 1314 bp encodes a putative polypeptide of 271 amino acids. To analyse the promoter sequence of common carp <i>her6</i>, sequences of various lengths upstream from the transcription initiation site of <i>her6</i> were fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (<i>eGFP</i>) and introduced into zebrafish embryos by microinjection to generate transgenic embryos. Our results show that the upstream sequence of 500 bp can direct highly efficient and tissue-specific expression of <i>eGFP</i> in zebrafish embryos, whereas a fragment of 200 bp containing the TATA box and a partial suppressor of hairless paired site sequence (SPS) is not sufficient to drive <i>eGFP</i> expression in zebrafish embryos.</p>

				<title>Recent integrations of mammalian <i>Hmg</i> retropseudogenes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0179-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We propose that select retropseudogenes of the high mobility group nonhistone chromosomal protein genes have recently integrated into mammalian genomes on the basis of the high sequence identity of the copies to the cDNA sequences derived from the original genes. These include the <i>Hmg1</i> gene family in mice and the <i>Hmgn2</i> family in humans. We investigated orthologous loci of several strains and species of <i>Mus</i> for presence or absence of apparently young <i>Hmg1</i> retropseudogenes. Three of four analysed elements were specific to <i>Mus musculus</i>, two of which were not fixed, indicative of recent evolutionary origins. Additionally, we datamined a presumptive subfamily (<i>Hmgz</i>) of mouse <i>Hmg1</i>, but only identified one true element in the GenBank database, which is not consistent with a separate subfamily status. Two of four analysed <i>Hmgn2</i> retropseudogenes were specific for the human genome, whereas a third was identified in human, chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, and a fourth additionally found in orangutan but absent in African green monkey. Flanking target-site duplications were consistent with LINE integration sites supporting LINE machinery for their mechanism of amplification. The human <i>Hmgn2</i> retropseudogenes were full length, whereas the mouse <i>Hmg1</i> elements were either full length or 3&#8242;-truncated at specific positions, most plausibly the result of use of alternative polyadenylation sites. The nature of their recent amplification success in relation to other retropseudogenes is unclear, although availability of a large number of transcripts during gametogenesis may be a reason. It is apparent that retropseudogenes continue to shape mammalian genomes, and may provide insight into the process of retrotransposition, as well as offer potential use as phylogenetic markers.</p>

				<title>Antioxidative response mechanisms in halophytes: their role in stress defence</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0237-0254</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Normal growth and development of plants is greatly dependent on the capacity to overcome environmental stresses. Environmental stress conditions like high salinity, drought, high incident light and low or high temperature cause major crop losses worldwide. A common denominator in all these adverse conditions is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within different cellular compartments of the plant cell. Plants have developed robust mechanisms including enzymatic or nonenzymatic scavenging pathways to counter the deleterious effects of ROS production. There are a number of general reviews on oxidative stress in plants and few on the role of ROS scavengers during stress conditions. Here we review the regulation of antioxidant enzymes during salt stress in halophytes, especially mangroves. We conclude that</p>
					<ol>
						<li>antioxidant enzymes protect halophytes from deleterious ROS production during salt stress, and</li>
						<li>genetic information from mangroves and other halophytes would be helpful in defining the roles of individual isoforms.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>This information would be critical in using the appropriate genes for oxidative stress defence for genetic engineering of enhanced stress tolerance in crop systems.</p>

				<title>A new method of testing for Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium and ordering populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0001-0007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The assumption of Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) among alleles in a nonevolving population is of fundamental importance in genetic studies. Deviation from HWE in a population usually indicates inbreeding, stratification and sometimes problems in genotyping. In populations of affected individuals, these deviations can also provide evidence for association. In this paper, we introduce a measure based on the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler discrimination information function that quantifies the deviation from HWE in a population. We use this measure to order populations. We also propose a test for HWE based on an estimate of this measure. The test is a statistically consistent test of the null hypothesis for all alternatives and is very easy to implement. Our proposed test statistic is compared with an earlier, widely used, test. Finally, the use of the proposed new test is shown in an illustrative example.</p>

				<title>Genetic structure of the rattan <i>Calamus thwaitesii</i> in core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in centralWestern Ghats, India: do protected areas serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0009-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on forests, the various protected areas‚Äînational parks, sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves‚Äîserve as the last footholds for conserving biological diversity. However, because protected areas are often targeted for the conservation of selected species, particularly charismatic animals, concerns have been raised about their effectiveness in conserving nontarget taxa and their genetic resources. In this paper, we evaluate whether protected areas can serve as refugia for genetic resources of economically important plants that are threatened due to extraction pressures. We examine the population structure and genetic diversity of an economically important rattan, <i>Calamus thwaitesii</i>, in the core, buffer and peripheral regions of three protected areas in the central Western Ghats, southern India. Our results indicate that in all the three protected areas, the core and buffer regions maintain a better population structure, as well as higher genetic diversity, than the peripheral regions of the protected area. Thus, despite the escalating pressures of extraction, the protected areas are effective in conserving the genetic resources of rattan. These results underscore the importance of protected areas in conservation of nontarget species and emphasize the need to further strengthen the protected-area network to offer refugia for economically important plant species.</p>

				<title>Chromosomal evolution and phylogenetic analyses in <i>Tayassu pecari</i> and <i>Pecari tajacu</i> (Tayassuidae): tales from constitutive heterochromatin</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0019-0026</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The mammalian family Tayassuidae (peccaries) is confined to the New World and comprises three recognized extant species, white-lipped (<i>Tayassu pecari</i>), collared (<i>Pecari tajacu</i>) and chacoan (<i>Catagonus wagneri</i>) peccaries, which exhibit distinct morphological and chromosomal features. The phylogenetic relationships among the tayassuids are unclear and have instigated debate over the palaeontological, cytogenetic and molecular aspects. Constitutive heterochromatin analysis can be used in understanding the phylogenetic relationships between related species. Here we describe, for the first time, the constitutive heterochromatin (C-positive heterochromatin) of two tayassuid species, <i>Tayassu pecari</i> and <i>Pecari tajacu</i>. We demonstrate that in <i>situ</i> restriction endonuclease digestion with sequential C-banding could be a complementary tool in the study of constitutive heterochromatin heterogeneity in chromosomes of the Tayassuidae. Our characterization of peccary chromosomes suggests that the <i>Pecari tajacu</i> autosomal karyotype is more primitive and has accumulated great diversity in its constitutive heterochromatin. This idea is supported by several other studies that analysed nuclear and mitochondrial sequences of the living peccary species. Finally, the tayassuid X chromosome primitive form seems to be the one of <i>Tayassu pecari</i>.</p>

				<title>Unique nucleotide polymorphism of ankyrin gene cluster in <i>Arabidopsis</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0027-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ankyrin (<i>ANK</i>) gene cluster is a part of a multigene family encoding ANK transmembrane proteins in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, and plays an important role in protein‚Äìprotein interactions and in signal pathways. In contrast to other regions of a genome, the <i>ANK</i> gene cluster exhibits an extremely high level of DNA polymorphism in an &#8764;5-kb region, without apparent decay. Phylogenetic analysis detects two clear, deeply differentiated haplotypes (dimorphism). The divergence between haplotypes of accession Col-0 and Ler-0 (Hap-C and Hap-L) is estimated to be 10.7%, approximately equal to the 10.5% average divergence between <i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>A. lyrata</i>. Sequence comparisons for the <i>ANK</i> gene cluster homologues in Col-0 indicate that the members evolve independently, and that the similarity among paralogues is lower than between alleles. Very little intralocus recombination or gene conversion is detected in <i>ANK</i> regions. All these characteristics of the <i>ANK</i> gene cluster are consistent with a tandem gene duplication and birth-and-death process. The possible mechanisms for and implications of this elevated nucleotide variation are also discussed, including the suggestion of balancing selection.</p>

				<title>Transposon display supports transpositional activity of ùëÉ elements in species of the <i>saltans</i> group of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0037-0043</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mobilization of two ùëÉ element subfamilies (canonical and O-type) from <i>Drosophila sturtevanti</i> and <i>D. saltans</i> was evaluated for copy number and transposition activity using the transposon display (TD) technique. Pairwise distances between strains regarding the insertion polymorphism profile were estimated. Amplification of the ùëÉ element based on copy number estimates was highly variable among the strains (<i>D. sturtevanti</i>, canonical 20.11, O-type 9.00; <i>D. saltans</i>, canonical 16.4, O-type 12.60 insertions, on average). The larger values obtained by TD compared to our previous data by Southern blotting support the higher sensitivity of TD over Southern analysis for estimating transposable element copy numbers. The higher numbers of the canonical ùëÉ element and the greater divergence in its distribution within the genome of <i>D. sturtevanti</i> (24.8%) compared to the O-type (16.7%), as well as the greater divergence in the distribution of the canonical P element, between the <i>D. sturtevanti</i> (24.8%) and the <i>D. saltans</i> (18.3%) strains, suggest that the canonical element occupies more sites within the <i>D. sturtevanti</i> genome, most probably due to recent transposition activity. These data corroborate the hypothesis that the O-type is the oldest subfamily of ùëÉ elements in the <i>saltans</i> group and suggest that the canonical ùëÉ element is or has been transpositionally active until more recently in <i>D. sturtevanti.</i></p>

				<title>Meiosis in a triploid hybrid of <i>Gossypium</i>: high frequency of secondary bipolar spindles at metaphase II</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0045-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Studies on meiosis in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of a triploid interspecific hybrid ($3x = 39$ chromosomes, AAD) between tetraploid <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> ($4n = 2x = 52$,AADD) and diploid <i>G. arboreum</i> ($2n = 2x = 26$,AA) are reported. During meiotic metaphase I, 13 AA bivalents and 13 D univalents are expected in the hybrid. However, only 28% of the PMCs had this expected configuration. The rest of the PMCs had between 8 and 12 bivalents and between 12 and 17 univalents. Univalents lagged at anaphase I, and at metaphase II one or a group of univalents remained scattered in the cytoplasm and failed to assemble at a single metaphase plate. Primary bipolar spindles organized around the bivalents and multivalents. In addition to the primary spindle, several secondary and smaller bipolar spindles organized themselves around individual univalents and groups of univalents. Almost all (97%) of the PMCs showed secondary spindles. Each spindle functioned independently and despite their multiple numbers in a cell, meiosis I proceeded normally, with polyad formation. These observations strongly support the view that in plant meiocytes bilateral kinetochore symmetry is not required for establishing a bipolar spindle and that single unpaired chromosomes can initiate and stabilize the formation of a functional bipolar spindle.</p>

				<title>The costae presenting in high-temperature-induced <i>vestigial</i> wings of <i>Drosophila</i>: implications for anterior wing margin formation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0051-0057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has long been noted that high temperature produces great variation in wing forms of the <i>vestigial</i> mutant of <i>Drosophila</i>. Most of the wings have defects in the wing blade and partially formed wing margin, which are the result of autonomous cell death in the presumptive wing blade or costal region of the wing disc. The <i>vestigial</i> gene ($vg$) and the interaction of Vg protein with other gene products are well understood. With this biochemical knowledge, reinvestigations of the high-temperature-induced vestigial wings and the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the large-scale variation of the wing forms may provide insight into further understanding of development of the wing of <i>Drosophila</i>. As a first step of such explorations, I examined high-temperature-induced (29&#176;C) vestigial wings. In the first part of this paper, I provide evidences to show that the proximal and distal costae in these wings exhibit regular and continuous variation, which suggests different developmental processes for the proximal and distal costal sections. Judging by the costae presenting in the anterior wing margin, I propose that the proximal and distal costal sections are independent growth units. The genes that regulate formation of the distal costal section also strongly affect proliferation of cells nearby; however, the same phenomenon has not been found in the proximal costal section. The distal costal section seems to be an extension of the radius vein. <i>vestigial</i>, one of the most intensely researched temperature-sensitive mutations, is a good candidate for the study of marginal vein formation. In the second part of the paper, I regroup the wing forms of these wings, chiefly by comparison of venation among these wings, and try to elucidate the variation of the wing forms according to the results of previous work and the conclusions reached in the first part of this paper, and provide clues for further researches.</p>

				<page>0085-0091</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>Sox9</i> gene is one of the important transcription factors in the development of many tissues and organs, particularly in sex determination and chondrogenesis. We amplified the genomic DNA of <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> using degenerate primers, and found that there were two versions of <i>Sox9</i> in this species: <i>Sox9a</i> and <i>Sox9b</i>, that differ in having an intron of different length (704 bp and 616 bp, respectively) in the conserved HMG box region that codes for identical amino acid sequences. We used a two-phase rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for the isolation of full-length cDNA of <i>Sox9b</i>. Sequence analyses revealed a 2447-bp cDNA containing 233-bp 5&#8242; untranslated region, a 927-bp 3&#8242; untranslated region, including poly(A), and a 1287 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 428 amino acids. The HMG box of 79 amino acid motif was confirmed from positions 96‚Äì174. Sequence alignment showed that the identity of amino acids of <i>Sox9</i> among ten animal species, including <i>C. carpio</i>, is 75%, indicating that the <i>Sox9</i> gene is evolutionarily quite conserved. The expression level of <i>Sox9b</i> gene varied among several organs of adult <i>C. carpio</i>, with the level of expression being highest in the brain and testis.</p>

				<title>A duplicated <i>coxI</i> gene is associated with cytoplasmic male sterility in an alloplasmic <i>Brassica juncea</i> line derived from somatic hybridization with <i>Diplotaxis catholica</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0093-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line of <i>Brassica juncea</i> was derived by repeated backcrossing of the somatic hybrid (<i>Diplotaxis catholica</i> + <i>B. juncea</i>) to <i>B. juncea</i>. The new CMS line is comparable to euplasmic lines for almost all characters, except for flowers which bear slender, needle-like anthers with aborted pollen. Detailed Southern analysis revealed two copies of <i>coxI</i> gene in the CMS line. One copy, coxI-1 is similar to the coxI gene of B. juncea, whereas the second copy, <i>coxI-2</i> is present in a novel rearranged region. Northern analysis with eight mitochondrial gene probes showed altered transcript pattern only for the <i>coxI</i> gene. Two transcripts of 2.0 and 2.4 kb, respectively, were detected in the CMS line. The novel 2.4 kb transcript was present in floral bud tissue but absent in the leaf tissue. In plants where male sterility broke down under high temperature during the later part of the growing season, the 2.4 kb <i>coxI</i> transcript was absent, which suggested its association with the CMS. The two <i>coxI</i> genes from the CMS line showed two amino acid changes in the coding region. The novel <i>coxI</i> gene showed unique repeats in the 5&#8242; region suggesting recombination of mitochondrial genomes of the two species. The possible role of the duplicated <i>coxI</i> gene in causing male sterility is discussed.</p>

				<title>Highly expressed genes are associated with inverse antisense transcription in mouse</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0103-0109</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There is a growing evidence, that antisense transcription might have a key role in a range of human diseases. Although predefined sense‚Äìantisense pairs were extensively studied, the antisense expression of the known sense genes is rarely investigated. We retrieved and correlated the expression of sense and antisense sequences of 1182 mouse transcripts to assess the prevalence and to find the characteristic pattern of antisense transcription. We contrasted three Affymetrix MGU74A version 1 mouse genome chips to six MGU74A version 2 chips. For these 1182 transcripts, the version 1 chips contain the antisense sequences of the transcripts presented on the version 2 chips. The original data was taken from the GEO database (GDS431 and GDS432). As the Affymetrix data are semiquantitative, the relative expression levels of antisense partners were analysed. We detected antisense transcription, although the average antisense expression is shifted towards smaller expression values (MGU74A version 1, 516; version 2, 1688). An inverse direct correlation between sense and antisense expression values could be observed at high expression values. At a very high relative expression‚Äîabove 40,000‚Äîthe Pearson correlation coefficient is getting closer to ‚àí1. Transcripts with high inverse expression ratio may be correlated to the investigated gene (major histocompatibility complex class II <i>trans</i> activator). The ratio of sense to antisense transcripts varied among different chromosomes; on chromosomes 14 and 1 the level of antisense expression was higher than that of sense. We conclude that antisense transcription is a common phenomenon in the mouse genome. The hypothesis of regulatory role of antisense transcripts is supported by the inverse antisense gene expression of highly expressed genes.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0111-0123</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The putative regulatory relationships between <i>Antennapedia (Antp), spalt major (salm)</i> and <i>homothorax (hth)</i> are tested with regard to the sensitive period of antenna-to-leg transformations. Although Antp expression repressed <i>hth</i> as predicted, contrary to expectations, <i>hth</i> did not show increased repression at higher Antp doses, whereas <i>salm</i>, a gene downstream of <i>hth</i>, did show such a dose response. Loss of <i>hth</i> allowed antenna-to-leg transformations but the relative timing of proximal‚Äìdistal transformations was reversed, relative to transformations induced by ectopic Antp. Finally, overexpression of Hth was only partially able to rescue transformations induced by ectopic Antp. These results indicate that there may be additional molecules involved in antenna/leg identity and that spatial, temporal and dosage relationships are more subtle than suspected and must be part of a robust understanding of molecular network behaviour involved in determining appendage identity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster.</i></p>

				<title>Nucleotide variation at the dopa decarboxylase (<i>Ddc</i>) gene in natural populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0125-0137</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We studied nucleotide sequence variation at the gene coding for dopa decarboxylase (<i>Ddc</i>) in seven populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Strength and pattern of linkage disequilibrium are somewhat distinct in the extensively sampled Spanish and Raleigh populations. In the Spanish population, a few sites are in strong positive association, whereas a large number of sites in the Raleigh population are associated nonrandomly but the association is not strong. Linkage disequilibrium analysis shows presence of two groups of haplotypes in the populations, each of which is fairly diverged, suggesting epistasis or inversion polymorphism. There is evidence of two forms of natural selection acting on <i>Ddc</i>. The McDonald‚ÄìKreitman test indicates a deficit of fixed amino acid differences between <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. simulans</i>, which may be due to negative selection. An excess of derived alleles at high frequency, significant according to the ùêª-test, is consistent with the effect of hitchhiking. The hitchhiking may have been caused by directional selection downstream of the locus studied, as suggested by a gradual decrease of the polymorphism-to-divergence ratio. Altogether, the <i>Ddc</i> locus exhibits a complicated pattern of variation apparently due to several evolutionary forces. Such a complex pattern may be a result of an unusually high density of functionally important genes.</p>

				<title>Mapping autonomously replicating sequence elements in a 73-kb region of chromosome II of the fission yeast, <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0139-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) elements are the genetic determinants of replication origin function in yeasts. They can be easily identified as the plasmids containing them transform yeast cells at a high frequency. As the first step towards identifying all potential replication origins in a 73-kb region of the long arm of fission yeast chromosome II, we have mapped five new ARS elements using systematic subcloning and transformation assay. 2D analysis of one of the ARS plasmids that showed highest transformation frequency localized the replication origin activity within the cloned genomic DNA. All the new ARS elements are localized in two clusters in centromere proximal 40 kb of the region. The presence of at least six ARS elements, including the previously reported <i>ars727</i>, is suggestive of a higher origin density in this region than that predicted earlier using a computer based search.</p>

				<title>Mesosternal bristle number in a cosmopolitan drosophilid: an X-linked variable trait independent of sternopleural bristles</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0149-0158</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mesosternal (MS) bristles in <i>Drosophila</i> are a pair of machrochaetae found at the sternal end of the sternopleural (STP) microchaetae, and are thought to be invariable. In a closely related drosophilid genus, <i>Zaprionus</i>, their number is four and, in contrast to <i>Drosophila</i>, they show interspecific and intraspecific variability. The genetic basis of MS bristle number variability was studied in <i>Z. indianus</i>, the only cosmopolitan species of the genus. The trait responded rapidly to selection and two lines were obtained, one lacking any bristles (0-0) and the other bearing the normal phenotype (2-2). Other symmetrical phenotypes, (1-1) and (3-3), could also be selected for, but with lesser success. By contrast, STP bristle number did not vary significantly between the two lines (0-0) and (2-2), revealing its genetic independence from MS bristle number. Reciprocal crosses between these two lines showed that MS bristle number is mainly influenced by a major gene on the X chromosome (i.e. F<sub>1</sub> males always resembled their mothers) with codominant expression (i.e. heterozygous F<sub>1</sub> females harboured an average phenotype of 2 bristles). However, trait penetrance was incomplete and backcrosses revealed that this variability was partly due to genetic modifiers, most likely autosomal. The canalization of MS bristle number was investigated under different temperatures, and the increased appearance of abnormal phenotypes mainly occurred at extreme temperatures. There was a bias, however, towards bristle loss, as shown by a liability (developmental map) analysis. Finally, when ancestral and introduced populations were compared, the latter were far less stable, suggesting that genetic bottlenecks may perturb the MS bristle number canalization system. MS bristle number, thus, appears to be an excellent model for investigating developmental canalization at both the quantitative and the molecular level.</p>

				<title>Genetic variation and population structure of interleukin genes among seven ethnic populations from Karnataka, India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0189-0194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The extent of genetic variation and the degree of genetic differentiation among seven ethnic populations from Karnataka, India (Bunt, Havyak, Iyengar, Lingayath, Smartha, Vaishya, Vokkaliga), was investigated using four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: <i>IL-1A 4845, IL-1B 3954, IL-1B 511</i> and <i>IL-1RA 2018</i>) of the interleukin gene cluster. Allele frequencies varied by threefold among these populations, which also differed for gene diversity and heterozygosity levels. The average degree of population subdivision among these castes was low ($F_{ST} = 0.02$). However, pair-wise interpopulation differentiation ranged from 0‚Äì7%, indicating no detectable differentiation to moderate differentiation between specific populations. The results of phylogenetic analysis based on genetic distances between populations agreed with known social and cultural data on these ethnic groups. Variation in the allele frequencies, as well as differentiation, may be attributed to differential selection and demographic factors including consanguinity among the ethnic groups. Information on the distribution of functionally relevant polymorphisms among ethnic populations may be important towards developing community medicine and public health policies.</p>

				<title>Mutations in the ùëÜ gene region of hepatitis B virus genotype ùê∑ in Turkish patients</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0195-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ùëÜ gene region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for the expression of surface antigens and includes the ‚Äòa‚Äô-determinant region. Thus, mutation(s) in this region would afford HBV variants a distinct survival advantage, permitting the mutant virus to escape from the immune system. The aim of this study was to search for mutations of the ùëÜ gene region in different patient groups infected with genotype ùê∑ variants of HBV, and to analyse the biological significance of these mutations. Moreover, we investigated ùëÜ gene mutation inductance among family members. Forty HBV-DNA-positive patients were determined among 132 hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) carriers by the first stage of seminested PCR. Genotypes and subtypes were established by sequencing of the amplified S gene regions. Variants were compared with original sequences of these serotypes, and mutations were identified. All variants were designated as genotype ùê∑ and subtype <i>ayw3</i>. Ten kinds of point mutations were identified within the ùëÜ region. The highest rates of mutation were found in chronic hepatitis patients and their family members. The amino acid mutations 125 (M ‚Üí T) and 127 (T ‚Üí P) were found on the first loop of ‚Äòa‚Äô-determinant. The other consequence was mutation inductance in a family member. We found some mutations in the S gene region known to be stable and observed that some of these mutations affected ùëÜ gene expression.</p>

				<title><i>Drosophila simulans Lethal hybrid rescue</i> mutation (<i>Lhr</i>) rescues inviable hybrids by restoring X chromosomal dosage compensation and causes fluctuating asymmetry of development</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0203-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>Drosophila simulans Lhr</i> rescues lethal hybrids from the cross of <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. simulans</i>. We describe here, the phenotypes of <i>Lhr</i> dependent rescue hybrids and demonstrate the effects of <i>Lhr</i> on functional morphology of the salivary chromosomes in the hybrids. Our results reveal that the phenotypes of the ‚Äò<i>Lhr</i> dependent rescued‚Äô hybrids were largely dependent on the genetic background and the dominance in species and hybrids, and not on <i>Lhr</i>. Cytological examination reveal that while the salivary chromosome of ‚Äòlarval lethal‚Äô male carrying <i>melanogaster</i> X chromosome was unusually thin and contracted, in ‚Äòrescued‚Äô hybrid males (C$_{mel}ùëã_{mel}ùëå_{sim}$;A$_{mel}ùê¥_{sim}$) the X chromosome showed typical pale staining, enlarged diameter and incorporated higher rate of <sup>3</sup>H-uridine in presence of one dose <i>Lhr</i> in the genome. In hybrid males carrying <i>simulans</i> X chromosome (C$_{mel}ùëã_{sim}ùëå_{mel}$;A$_{mel}ùê¥_{sim}$), enlarged width of the polytene X chromosome was noted in most of the nuclei, in <i>Lhr</i> background, and transcribed at higher rate than that of the single X chromosome of male. In hybrid females (both viable, e.g., C$_{mel}$ X$_{mel}$ X$_{sim}$; A$_{mel}$ A$_{sim}$ and rescued, e.g., C$_{mel}$ X$_{mel}$ X$_{mel}$; A$_{mel}$ A$_{sim}$), the functional morphology of the X chromosomes were comparable to that of diploid autosomes in presence of one dose of <i>Lhr</i>. In hybrid metafemales, (C$_{mel}ùëã_{mel}ùëã_{mel}ùëã_{sim}$; A$_{mel}ùê¥_{sim}$), two dose of <i>melanogaster</i> X chromosomes and one dose of <i>simulans</i> X chromosome were transcribed almost at ‚Äòfemale‚Äô rate in hybrid genetic background in presence of one dose of <i>Lhr</i>. In rescued hybrid males, the <i>melanogaster</i>-derived X chromosome appeared to complete its replication faster than autosomes. These results together have been interpreted to have suggested that <i>Lhr</i> suppresses the lethality of hybrids by regulating functional activities of the X chromosome(s) for dosage compensation.</p>

					<p>Male accessory gland secretory protein polymorphism was analysed in natural populations of <i>Drosophila nasuta nasuta</i> and <i>D. sulfurigaster neonasuta</i> for the first time, using SDS-PAGE to score polymorphism of these proteins in 2788 individuals of <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and 2232 individuals of <i>D. s. neonasuta</i> from 12 different populations from southern India. A total of 25 and 18 variant protein phenotypes were identified in <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and <i>D. s. neonasuta</i>, respectively. Protein fractions of group III were more polymorphic than those from groups I and II. The results show that accessory gland secretory proteins show high levels of polymorphism, irrespective of species or habitat. Moreover, we have used the variation in the accessory gland proteins to assess the extent of divergence between the species and to infer their population structure. The study suggests that though both <i>D. n. nasuta</i> and <i>D. s. neonasuta</i> belong to the same subgroup, they differ in population structure, as far as accessory gland protein polymorphism is concerned.</p>

				<title>Patterns of nucleotide sequence variation in <i>ICAM1</i> and <i>TNF</i> genes in twelve ethnic groups of India: roles of demographic history and natural selection</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0225-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied DNA sequence variation in and around the genes <i>ICAM1</i> and <i>TNF</i>, which play functional and correlated roles in inflammatory processes and immune cell responses, in 12 diverse ethnic groups of India, with a view to investigating the relative roles of demographic history and natural selection in shaping the observed patterns of variation. The total numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected at the <i>ICAM1</i> and <i>TNF</i> loci were 29 and 12, respectively. Haplotype and allele frequencies differed significantly across populations. The site frequency spectra at these loci were significantly different from those expected under neutrality, and showed an excess of intermediate-frequency variants consistent with balancing selection. However, as expected under balancing selection, there was no significant reduction of $F_{ST}$ values compared to neutral autosomal loci. Mismatch distributions were consistent with population expansion for both loci. On the other hand, the phylogenetic network among haplotypes for the <i>TNF</i> locus was similar to expectations under population expansion, while that for the <i>ICAM1</i> was as expected under balancing selection. Nucleotide diversity at the <i>ICAM1</i> locus was an order of magnitude lower in the promoter region, compared to the introns or exons, but no such difference was noted for the <i>TNF</i> gene. Thus, we conclude that the pattern of nucleotide variation in these genes has been modulated by both demographic history and selection. This is not surprising in view of the known allelic associations of several polymorphisms in these genes with various diseases, both infectious and noninfectious.</p>

				<title>Isolation, characterization and genetic analysis of canine <i>GATA4</i> gene in a family of Doberman Pinschers with an atrial septal defect</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0241-0247</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>GATA4</i> is expressed early in the developing heart where it plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes encoding myocardial contractile proteins. Gene mutations in the human <i>GATA4</i> have been implicated in various congenital heart defects (CHD), including atrial septal defect (ASD). Although ASD is the third most common CHD in humans, it is generally rare in dogs and cats. There is also no obvious predilection for ASD in dogs and cats, based on sex or breed. However, among dogs, the incidence rate of ASD is relatively high in Samoyeds and Doberman Pinschers, where its inheritance and genetic aetiology are not well understood. In this study, we identified and investigated the genetic aetiology of an ASD affected family in a pure breed dog population. Although the <i>GATA4</i> gene was screened, we did not find any mutations that would result in the alteration of the coding sequence and hence, the predicted <i>GATA4</i> structure and function. Although the aetiology of ASD is multifactorial, our findings indicate that <i>GATA4</i> may not be responsible for the ASD in the dogs used in this study. However, this does not eliminate <i>GATA4</i> as a candidate for ASD in other dog breeds.</p>

				<title>Origin of new <i>Brassica</i> types from a single intergeneric hybrid between <i>B. rapa</i> and <i>Orychophragmus violaceus</i> by rapid chromosome evolution and introgression</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0249-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many novel lines were established from an intergeneric mixoploid between <i>Brassica rapa</i> ($2n = 20$) and <i>Orychophragmus violaceus</i> ($2n = 24$) through successive selections for fertility and viability. Pedigrees of individual F<sub>2</sub> plants were advanced to the 10th generation by selfing. Their breeding habit was self-compatible and different from the self-incompatibility of their female parent <i>B. rapa</i>, and these lines were reproductively isolated to different degrees from <i>B. rapa</i> and <i>B. napus</i>. The lines with high productivity showed not only a wide spectrum of phenotypes but also obvious variations in fatty acid profiles of seed oil and glucosinolate contents in seed meal. These lines had $2n = 36$, 37, 38, 39 and 40, with $2n = 38$ being most frequent (64.56%), and no intact <i>O. violaceus</i> chromosomes were detected by genomic <i>in situ</i> hybridization (GISH) analysis. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses revealed a high extent of variation in genomic compositions across all the lines. <i>O. violaceus</i>-specific bands, deleted bands in <i>B. rapa</i> and novel bands for two parents were detected in these lines, with novel bands being the most frequent. The morphological and genetic divergence of these novel types derived from a single hybrid is probably due to rapid chromosomal evolution and introgression, and provides new genetic resources for rapeseed breeding.</p>

				<page>0259-0268</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An integrated genetic linkage map of the medicinal and ornamental plant <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>, based on different types of molecular and morphological markers was constructed, using a F<sub>2</sub> population of 144 plants. The map defines 14 linkage groups (LGs) and consists of 131 marker loci, including 125 molecular DNA markers (76 RAPD, 3 RAPD combinations; 7 ISSR; 2 EST-SSR from <i>Medicago truncatula</i> and 37 other PCR based DNA markers), selected from a total of 472 primers or primer pairs, and six morphological markers (stem pigmentation, leaf lamina pigmentation and shape, leaf petiole and pod size, and petal colour). The total map length is 1131.9 cM (centiMorgans), giving an average map length and distance between two markers equal to 80.9 cM and 8.6 cM, respectively. The morphological markers/genes were found linked with nearest molecular or morphological markers at distances varying from 0.7 to 11.4 cM. Linkage was observed between the morphological markers concerned with lamina shape and petiole size of leaf on LG1 and leaf, stem and petiole pigmentation and pod size on LG8. This is the first genetic linkage map of <i>C. roseus</i>.</p>

				<title>Association study of the oestrogen signalling pathway genes in relation to age at natural menopause</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0269-0276</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic factors play a significant role in influencing the variation of age at natural menopause (AANM). Estrogen receptor ùõΩ (<i>ESR2</i>), is an important factor in the mechanism of action of estrogen, while the aromatase gene (<i>CYP19</i>) and the 17-alpha-hydroxylase gene (<i>CYP17</i>) are involved in the biosynthesis of estrogen. We tested whether polymorphisms of <i>ESR2, CYP19</i> and <i>CYP17</i> genes are associated with AANM in Caucasian females. A total of 52 SNPs (17 for <i>ESR2</i>, 28 for <i>CYP19</i>, and 7 for <i>CYP17</i>) were successfully genotyped for 229 Caucasian women having experienced natural menopause. Comprehensive statistical analyses focusing on the association of these genes with AANM were conducted. The effects of age, height and age at menarche on AANM were adjusted when conducting association analyses. We found that six SNPs (2, 6-7, 9, 13 and 16) within <i>ESR2</i> were not significantly associated with AANM after Bonferroni correction. However, two blocks of <i>ESR2</i> were associated with AANM. For <i>CYP19</i>, two SNPs (24 and 27) were nominally associated with AANM. No significant association was observed between <i>CYP17</i> and AANM. Our results suggest that genetic variation in the <i>ESR2</i> and <i>CYP19</i> genes may influence the variation in AANM in Caucasian women.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Analyses of frequency profiles of markers on disease or drug-response related genes in diverse populations are important for the dissection of common diseases. We report the results of analyses of data on 405 SNPs from 75 such genes and a 5.2 Mb chromosome, 22 genomic region in 1871 individuals from diverse 55 endogamous Indian populations. These include 32 large (&#62;10 million individuals) and 23 isolated populations, representing a large fraction of the people of India. We observe high levels of genetic divergence between groups of populations that cluster largely on the basis of ethnicity and language. Indian populations not only overlap with the diversity of HapMap populations, but also contain population groups that are genetically distinct. These data and results are useful for addressing stratification and study design issues in complex traits especially for heterogeneous populations.</p>

				<title><i>Eucalyptus</i> microsatellites mined in <i>silico</i>: survey and evaluation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0021-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Eucalyptus</i> is an important short rotation pulpy woody plant, grown widely in the tropics. Recently, many genomic programmes are underway leading to the accumulation of voluminous genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences in public databases. These sequences can be utilized for analysis of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) available in the transcribed genes. In this study, <i>in silico</i> analysis of 15,285 sequences representing partial and full-length mRNA from <i>Eucalyptus</i> species for their use in developing SSRs or microsatellites were carried out. A total of 875 EST-SSRs were identified from 772 SSR containing ESTs. Motif size of 6 for dinucleotide and 5 for trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, and pentanucleotides were considered in locating the microsatellites. The average frequency of identified SSRs was 12.9%. The dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant among the dinucleotide, trinucleotide and tetranucleotide motifs and accounted for 50.9% of the <i>Eucalyptus</i> genome. Primer designing analysis showed that 571 sequences with SSRs had sufficient flanking regions for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer synthesis. Evaluation of the usefulness of the SSRs showed that EST-derived SSRs can generate polymorphic markers as all the primers showed allelic diversity among the 16 provenances of <i>E. tereticornis.</i></p>

				<title>Desynapsis and precocious cytokinesis in <i>Brachiaria humidicola</i> (Poaceae) compromise meiotic division</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0027-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The forage grass species <i>Brachiaria humidicola</i> is native to African savannas. Owing to its good adaptation to poorly drained and infertile acid soils, it has achieved wide utilization for pastures in Brazilian farms. Among the 55 accessions of <i>B. humidicola</i> analysed from the Embrapa Beef Cattle collection, one (H022), presented desynapsis and an abnormal pattern of cytokinesis in the first meiotic division. Among 28 inflorescences analysed in this accession, 12 were affected by the anomaly. In affected meiocytes, the first cytokinesis occurred in metaphase I and was generally perpendicular to a wide-metaphase plate, dividing the genome into two parts with an equal or unequal number of chromosomes. The normal cytokinesis after telophase I did not occur, and the meiocytes entered metaphase II, progressing to the end of meiosis with the occurrence of the second cytokinesis. As the first cytokinesis occurred precociously, whereas the second was normal, tetrads were formed but with unbalanced chromosome numbers in microspores. Abnormal cytokinesis occurred only in those meiocytes that underwent desynapsis after diakinesis. The implications of this abnormality in the <i>Brachiaria</i> breeding programme are discussed.</p>

				<title>Meiotic behaviour in three interspecific three-way hybrids between <i>Brachiaria ruziziensis</i> and <i>B. brizantha</i> (Poaceae: Paniceae)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0033-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The meiotic behaviour of three three-way interspecific promising hybrids (H17, H27, and H34) was evaluated. These hybrids resulted from the crosses between <i>B. ruziziensis</i> &#215; <i>B. brizantha</i> and crossed to another <i>B. brizantha</i>. Two half-sib hybrids (H27 and H34) presented an aneuploid chromosome number ($2n = 4x = 33$), whereas hybrid H17 was a tetraploid ($2n = 4x = 36$), as expected. Chromosome paired predominantly as multivalents suggesting that genetic recombination and introgression of specific target genes from <i>B. brizantha</i> into <i>B. ruziziensis</i> can be expected. Arrangement of parental genomes in distinct metaphase plates was observed in H27 and H34, which have different male genitors. Hybrids H17 and H34 have the same male genitor, but did not display this abnormality. In H17, abnormalities were more frequent from anaphase II, when many laggard chromosomes appeared, suggesting that each genome presented a different genetic control for meiotic phase timing. Despite the phylogenetic proximity among these two species, these three hybrids presented a high frequency of meiotic abnormalities, mainly those related to irregular chromosome segregation typical of polyploids, H34, 69.1%; H27, 56.1% and H17, 44.9%. From the accumulated results obtained through cytological studies in <i>Brachiaria hybrids</i>, it is evident that cytogenetical analysis is of prime importance in determining which genotypes can continue in the process of cultivar development and which can be successfully used in the breeding. Hybrids with high frequency of meiotic abnormalities can seriously compromise seed production, a key trait in assuring adoption of a new apomictic cultivar of <i>Brachiaria</i> for pasture formation.</p>

				<title>Simple sequence repeat marker development and genetic mapping in quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0039-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quinoa is a regionally important grain crop in the Andean region of South America. Recently quinoa has gained international attention for its high nutritional value and tolerances of extreme abiotic stresses. DNA markers and linkage maps are important tools for germplasm conservation and crop improvement programmes. Here we report the development of 216 new polymorphic SSR (simple sequence repeats) markers from libraries enriched for GA, CAA and AAT repeats, as well as 6 SSR markers developed from bacterial artificial chromosome-end sequences (BES-SSRs). Heterozygosity (H) values of the SSR markers ranges from 0.12 to 0.90, with an average value of 0.57. A linkage map was constructed for a newly developed recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population using these SSR markers. Additional markers, including amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), two 11S seed storage protein loci, and the nucleolar organizing region (NOR), were also placed on the linkage map. The linkage map presented here is the first SSR-based map in quinoa and contains 275 markers, including 200 SSR. The map consists of 38 linkage groups (LGs) covering 913 cM. Segregation distortion was observed in the mapping population for several marker loci, indicating possible chromosomal regions associated with selection or gametophytic lethality. As this map is based primarily on simple and easily-transferable SSR markers, it will be particularly valuable for research in laboratories in Andean regions of South America.</p>

				<title><i>GJB2</i> and mitochondrial A1555G gene mutations in nonsyndromic profound hearing loss and carrier frequencies in healthy individuals</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0053-0057</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study aimed to assess mutations in <i>GJB2</i> gene (connexin 26), as well as A1555G mitochondrial mutation in both the patients with profound genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss and healthy controls. Ninety-five patients with profound hearing loss (&#62;90 dB) and 67 healthy controls were included. All patients had genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss. Molecular analyses were performed for connexin 26 (35delG, M34T, L90P, R184P, delE120, 167delT, 235delC and IVS1+1 A ‚Üí G) mutations, and for mitochondrial A1555G mutation. Twenty-two connexin 26 mutations were found in 14.7% of the patients, which were 35delG, R184P, del120E and IVS1+1 A ‚Üí G. Mitochondrial A1555G mutation was not encountered. The most common <i>GJB2</i> gene mutation was 35delG, which was followed by del120E, IVS1+1 A ‚Üí G and R184P, and 14.3% of the patients segregated with DFNB1. In consanguineous marriages, the most common mutation was 35delG. The carrier frequency for 35delG mutation was 1.4% in the controls. 35delG and del120E populations, seems the most common connexin 26 mutations that cause genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss in this country. Nonsyndromic hearing loss mostly shows DFNB1 form of segregation.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The fact that malaria is still an uncontrolled disease is reflected by the genetic organization of the parasite genome. Efforts to curb malaria should begin with proper understanding of the mechanism by which the parasites evade human immune system and evolve resistance to different antimalarial drugs. We have initiated such a study and presented herewith the results from the in <i>silico</i> understanding of a seventh chromosomal region of the malarial parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> encompassing the antigenic <i>var</i> genes (coding <i>pfemp1</i>) and the drug-resistant gene <i>pfcrt</i> located at a specified region of the chromosome 7. We found 60 genes of various functions and lengths, majority (61.67%) of them were performing known functions. Almost all the genes have orthologs in other four species of <i>Plasmodium</i>, of which <i>P. chabaudi</i> seems to be the closest to <i>P. falciparum</i>. However, only two genes were found to be paralogous. Interestingly, the drug-resistant gene, <i>pfcrt</i> was found to be surrounded by seven genes coding for several CG proteins out of which six were reported to be responsible for providing drug resistance to <i>P. vivax</i>. The intergenic regions, in this specified region were generally large in size, majority (73%) of them were of more than 500 nucleotide bp length. We also designed primers for amplification of 21 noncoding DNA fragments in the whole region for estimating genetic diversity and inferring the evolutionary history of this region of <i>P. falciparum</i> genome.</p>

				<title>Molecular assessment of genetic diversity in mung bean germplasm</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0065-0074</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>RAPD profiles were used to identify the extent of diversity among 54 accessions of mung bean that included both improved and local land races. Out of the 40 primers screened, seven primers generated 174 amplification products with an average of 24.85 bands per primer. The RAPD profiles were analysed for Jaccard‚Äôs similarity coefficients that was found to be in the range from 0 to 0.48, indicating the presence of wide range of genetic diversity at molecular level. Cluster analysis was carried out based on distances (1-similarity coefficient) using neighbour-joining method in Free Tree package. The dendrogram resolved all the accessions into two major clusters, I (with 11 accessions) and II (with 43 accessions). However, the cluster was further divided into four subclusters (II A with six, II B with nine, II C with 15 and II D with 13 accessions). The distribution of the accessions in different clusters and subclusters appeares to be related to their performance in field conditions for 10 morphological traits that were scored. This study indicated that the RAPD profiles provide an easy and simple technique for preliminary genetic diversity assessment of mung bean accessions that may reflect morphological trait differences among them.</p>

				<title>Novel non-HLA-susceptible regions determined by meta-analysis of four genomewide scans for ankylosing spondylitis</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0075-0081</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We identified novel non-HLA-susceptible regions for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) by applying the genome-search-meta-analysis (GSMA) method to combine the previous four AS genomewide scan studies including 479 families with 1175 affected individuals. Three original genomescans were mainly analysed for Caucasian families and one analysed for Han Mongolian families. Ten bins had both Psumrnk and Pord &#60; 0.05, suggesting these bins most likely contain AS-linked loci. The 10 bins are 6.2, 16.3, 6.1, 3.3, 6.3, 16.4, 10.5, 17.1, 2.5 and 2.9. The most significant result of linkage was on chromosome 6p22.3‚Äìp21.1 (bin 6.2, Psumrnk &#60; 0.000417), where HLA loci are located. By addition of a genome scan of Chinese origin, our GSMA result further confirmed the HLA loci as the greatest susceptible region to AS and suggested that non-HLA loci chromosome 16q, 3p, 10q, 2p, 2q and 17p, may also contain AS-linked loci. The novel loci identified in our result give hints to further studies.	</p>

				<title>Characterization of gene expression regulated by human <i>OTK18</i> using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model system for innate immunity</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0109-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>OTK18 is a human transcriptional suppressor implicated in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type-one infection of mononuclear phagocytes. It is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues, but its normal homeostatic function is yet to be characterized. One hypothesis is that OTK18 aids in the regulation of the innate immune system. To test this hypothesis, cDNA microarray analysis was performed on the total RNA extracted from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> embryonic Schneider 2 (S2) cells transfected with either <i>pEGFP-OTK18</i> (enhanced green fluorescent protein) or empty vector controls (<i>pEGFP-N3</i>) for 6, 12 and 24 h. cDNA microarray analysis revealed differential expression of genes known to be important in regulation of <i>Drosophila</i> innate immunity. The expression levels of two genes, <i>Metchnikowin</i> and <i>CG16708</i> were verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. These results suggest a role for OTK18 in innate immunity.</p>

				<page>0119-0125</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chromosome identification is essential in oyster genomic research. Fluorescence in <i>situ</i> hybridization (FISH) offers new opportunities for the identification of oyster chromosomes. It has been used to locate satellite DNAs, telomeres or ribosomal DNA sequences. However, regarding chromosome identification, no study has been conducted with simple sequence repeats (SSRs). FISH was used to probe the physical organization of three particular SSRs, (GGAT)<sub>4</sub>, (GT)<sub>7</sub> and (TA)<sub>10</sub> onto metaphase chromosomes of the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>. Hybridization signals were observed in all the SSR probes, but the distribution and intensity of signals varied according to the oligonucleotide repeat. The intercalary, centromeric and telomeric bands were observed along the chromosomes, and for each particular repeat every chromosome pair presented a similar pattern, allowing karyotypic analysis with all the SSRs tested. Our study is the first in mollusks to show the application of SSR in <i>situ</i> hybridization for chromosome identification and karyotyping. This technique can be a useful tool for oyster comparative studies and to understand genome organization in different oyster taxa.</p>

				<title>A search for transmission ratio distortions in offspring from crosses between inbred mice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0127-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Equal transmission of the two alleles at a locus from a heterozygote parent to the offspring is rarely violated. Beside the differential embryonic mortality, nondisjunction and gene conversion that are rather irregular forms of transmission‚Äìratio distortion (TRD), there are two major forms of departure from Mendelian segregation. The first, found in females, based on the asymmetric nature of female meiosis, is usually referred to as meiotic drive, and has been well documented in a few cases. The second is segregation distortion found in males. There are several known male-related segregation distortion systems that are caused by different fertilizing capacity of sperm cells carrying alternative alleles at a particular locus. Observation of TRD effects requires a sufficient number of offspring produced by a parental pair. As individuals in a population most likely have different genotypes in TRD affecting loci, the total transmission ratio is close to the expected Mendelian ratio and masks potential TRD effects. Highly inbred strains of laboratory mice provide a very good model for studying this phenomenon, because comparing two mice strains is effectively similar as comparison of two individuals in a population. This study tests both forms of TRD in progeny of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids from reciprocal crosses of inbred mice. Three previously unknown instances of TRD in females were observed. Therefore, this study concludes that some genes in females may carry alleles that can cause segregation distortion.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The exact localization of an insertion in the genome of transgenic plants obtained by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation is an integral part of most experiments aimed at studying these types of mutants. There are several methods for isolating unknown nucleotide sequences of genomic DNA which flank the borders of T-DNA integrated in the genome of plants. However, all the methods based on PCR have limitations which in some cases do not permit the desired objective to be achieved. We have developed a new technique for isolating flanking sequence tags (FSTs) via modified inverse PCR. This method is highly efficient and simple, but also retains the advantages of previously well-documented approaches.</p>

				<page>0141-0146</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The gene <i>EG:22E5.5</i> or <i>CG4199</i> (accession number O77266, Q9W529) from Berkeley <i>Drosophila</i> Genome Project (BDGP) was found using the partial amino acid sequences of three tryptic peptides obtained from purified <i>Drosophila virilis</i> diaphorase-1. This gene is located on the X chromosome at position 2C9‚Äì2C10. The structure of the gene reveals three exons and two long introns. Using BDGP, we found six transcripts in this gene. The difference between these transcripts is in their 5&#8242; ends; the 3&#8242; ends of the six transcripts are identical. Thirty-four ESTs from different cDNA libraries were found, most of them from Schneider L2 cell culture (SH) cDNA library. The transcripts are represented at very low level in the cells of different organs and at different stages of <i>Drosophila</i> development. Using RT-PCR, we obtained five of these transcripts in cDNA samples from female adult flies. However, we could not find any of them in cDNA samples from male adult flies. Moreover, we obtained only the third transcript (CG4199-RC) in the sample of testis from adult flies and the fourth transcript (CG4199-RD) in an embryo sample. None of the other five transcripts were found in the samples of different organs and in the samples obtained at different stages of <i>Drosophila</i> development.</p>

				<title>Human oocyte chromosome analysis: complicated cases and major pitfalls</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0147-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Human oocytes that remained unfertilized in programmes of assisted reproduction have been analysed cytogenetically for more than 20 years to assess the incidence of aneuploidy in female gametes. However, the results obtained so far are not indisputable as a consequence of difficulties in evaluating oocyte chromosome preparations. Because of the lack of guidelines, we decided to summarize for the first time, the possible pitfalls in human oocyte chromosome analysis. Therefore, we screened the material from our previous studies and compiled representative, complicated cases with recommendations for their cytogenetic classification. We point out that maturity and size of the oocyte are important parameters and that fixation artefacts, as well as the particular structure of oocyte chromosomes, may predispose one to misinterpretations. Moreover, phenomena related to oocyte activation and fertilization are illustrated and explained. This compilation may help to avoid major problems in future studies and contribute to a more precise, and uniform assessment of human oocyte chromosomes.</p>

				<title>Mapping quantitative trait loci for binary trait in the F<sub>2:3</sub> design</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0201-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the analysis of inheritance of quantitative traits with low heritability, an F<sub>2:3</sub> design that genotypes plants in F<sub>2</sub> and phenotypes plants in F<sub>2:3</sub> progeny is often used in plant genetics. Although statistical approaches for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the F<sub>2:3</sub> design have been well developed, those for binary traits of biological interest and economic importance are seldom addressed. In this study, an attempt was made to map binary trait loci (BTL) in the F<sub>2:3</sub> design. The fundamental idea was: the F<sub>2</sub> plants were genotyped, all phenotypic values of each F<sub>2:3</sub> progeny were measured for binary trait, and these binary trait values and the marker genotype informations were used to detect BTL under the penetrance and liability models. The proposed method was verified by a series of Monte‚ÄìCarlo simulation experiments. These results showed that maximum likelihood approaches under the penetrance and liability models provide accurate estimates for the effects and the locations of BTL with high statistical power, even under of low heritability. Moreover, the penetrance model is as efficient as the liability model, and the F<sub>2:3</sub> design is more efficient than classical F<sub>2</sub> design, even though only a single progeny is collected from each F<sub>2:3</sub> family. With the maximum likelihood approaches under the penetrance and the liability models developed in this study, we can map binary traits as we can do for quantitative trait in the F<sub>2:3</sub> design.</p>

				<title>Adaptation to different climates results in divergent phenotypic plasticity of wing size and shape in an invasive drosophilid</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0209-0217</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phenotypic plasticity of wing size and wing shape of <i>Zaprionus indianus</i> was investigated in relation to growth temperature (17&#176;C to 31&#176;C) in two natural populations living under different climates, equatorial and subtropical. The two populations were clearly distinguished not only by their wing size (the populations from the colder climate being bigger in size), but also by the shape of the response curves to growth temperature i.e., their reaction norms. In this respect, the temperature at which the size of the wing was maximum was about 3&#176;C higher in the equatorial population. Such a difference in size plasticity is already found in two other nonclosely related species, might be a general evolutionary pattern in drosophilids. Wing shape was investigated by calculating an ellipse included into the wing blade, then by considering the ratio of the two axes, and also by analysing the angular position of 10 wing-vein landmarks. For an overall shape index (ratio of the two axes of the ellipse), a regular and almost linear increase was observed with increasing temperature i.e., a more round shape at high temperatures. Wing shape was also analysed by considering the variations of the various angles according to temperature. A diversity of response curves was observed, revealing either a monotonous increase or decrease with increasing temperature, and sometimes a bell shape curve. An interesting conclusion is that, in most cases, a significant difference was observed between the two populations, and the difference was more pronounced at low temperatures. These angular variations are difficult to interpret in an evolutionary context. More comparative studies should be undertaken before reaching some general conclusions.</p>

				<title>Expression and identification of folate-sensitive fragile sites in British Suffolk sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>)</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>An investigation to understand the dynamics and biological significance of fragile site expression, and identification of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) induced chromosomal gaps/breaks, were carried out in an experimental flock of 45 Suffolk sheep. The statistical comparison revealed, highly significant variation in the frequency of chromosomal fragile site expression between control and FUdR cultures. Mean (¬± S.D.) values for cells with gaps and breaks, or aberrant cell count (AC), and the number of aberrations (NoA) per animal were 2.02 ¬± 0.34, 2.42 ¬± 0.48, 13.26 ¬± 0.85 and 21.87 ¬± 1.88 ($P \lt 0.01$) in control and FUdR cultures, respectively. The comparison of age revealed nonsignificant variation between control and FUdR cultures. The G-band analysis of fragile site data revealed gaps in 29 autosomal and two X-chromosomal bands in the control cultures, whereas FUdR treated cultures scored 78 unstable bands in autosomes of which 56 were significantly fragile. X-chromosomes expressed breaks and gaps in six G-negative bands and five of them (Xq13, Xq15, Xq17, Xq24 and Xq26) were significantly fragile. The distribution comparison of autosomal fragile sites between sex groups did not reveal any significant variation. Female X-chromosomes were significantly more fragile than the male X-chromosomes. The distribution comparison for age groups (lambs versus adults) revealed significantly higher number of fragile bands in adults. Comparison of published data on reciprocal translocations in sheep with the fragile-site data obtained in this study indicated that the break sites of both phenomena were correlated. Similarities were also found between fragile sites and breakpoints of evolutionary significance in family Bovidae.</p>

				<title>ùõº-Thalassaemia in Tunisia: some epidemiological and molecular data</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0229-0234</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Unlike the other haemoglobinopathies, few researches have been published concerning ùõº-thalassaemia in Tunisia. The aim of the present work is to acquire further data concerning ùõº-thalassaemia prevalence and molecular defects spectrum in Tunisia, by collecting and studying several kinds of samples carrying ùõº-thalassaemia. The first survey conducted on 529 cord blood samples using cellulose acetate electrophoresis, have displayed the prevalence of 7.38% Hb Bart‚Äôs carriers at birth. Molecular analyses were conducted by PCR and DNA sequencing on 20 families‚Äô cases from the above survey carrying the Hb Bart‚Äôs at birth and on 10 Hb H diseased patients. The results showed six ùõº-globin gene molecular defects and were responsible for ùõº-thalassaemia: -ùõº<sup>3.7</sup>, - -<sup>MedI</sup>, ùõº<sup>TSaudi</sup>, ùõº<sup>cd23GAG</sup> \to Stop<sub>2</sub>, Hb Greone Hart: ùõº<sup>119CCT</sup> \to TCT<sub>1</sub> corresponding to 11 genotypes out of which two are responsible for Hb H disease (--<sup>Med</sup>/$-$ùõº<sup>3.7</sup>) and (ùõº<sup>TSaudi</sup>ùõº/ùõº<sup>TSaudi</sup>ùõº) and a newly described polymorphism: ùõº<sup>+6 ‚Üí G</sup>. The geographical repartition of ùõº-thal carriers showed that the $-$ùõº<sup>3.7</sup> deletion is distributed all over the country, respectively the ùõº<sup>HphI</sup> and ùõº<sup>TSaudi</sup> seem to be more frequent in the central region of the northeast region. The haematological and clinical data showed a moderate phenotype with a late age of diagnosis for Hb H disease. This work had permitted, in addition to an overview on ùõº-thalassaemia in the country, the optimization of protocols for ùõº-thalassaemia detection in our lab, allowing further investigations concerning phenotype‚Äìgenotype correlation in sickle cell disease or ùõΩ-thalassaemia.</p>

				<title>Cold-induced alteration in the global structure of the male sex chromosome of <i>In(1)B</i>$^{M2}$<i>(reinverted)</i> of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is associated with increased acetylation of histone 4 at lysine 16</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0235-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, dosage compensation occurs through hypertranscription of sex-linked genes in males. The hypertranscription involves acetylation of histone 4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) on amale X-chromosome, brought about by a histone acetyltransferase encoded by the dosage compensation gene, <i>males absent on the first (mof)</i>. We report a phenomenon in the strain <i>In(1)B</i>$^{M2}$(<i>reinverted</i>) of <i>D. melanogaster</i> where the global structure of the male X-chromosome can be altered at the third instar larval stage through a 4-h cold shock at 12¬±1&#176;C. We show that the cold shock results in a transient hyperacetylation of H4K16 and an increased expression of <i>MOF</i>. Control proteins H4 acetylated at lysine 5, and the dosage compensation gene <i>msl-2</i>, do not show any change in expression after cold shock. Cytology of the male X-chromosome at different time points during cold shock and recovery, suggests that the hyperacetylation of H4 at lysine 16 causes the X-chromosome to corkscrew into itself, thereby achieving the cold-induced change in the higher order structure of the male polytene X-chromosome. Our studies suggest a role for H4K16 in maintaining the structure of the male X-chromosome in <i>Drosophila.</i></p>

				<title>Morphological and microsatellite diversity associated with ecological factors in natural populations of <i>Medicago laciniata</i> Mill. (Fabaceae)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0241-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variability in 10 natural Tunisian populations of <i>Medicago laciniata</i> were analysed using 19 quantitative traits and 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. A large degree of genetic variability within-populations and among-populations was detected for both quantitative characters and molecular markers. High genetic differentiation among populations for quantitative traits was seen, with $Q_{ST} = 0.47$, and $F_{ST} = 0.47$ for microsatellite markers. Several quantitative traits displayed no statistical difference in the levels of $Q_{ST}$ and $F_{ST}$. Further, significant correlations between quantitative traits and eco-geographical factors suggest that divergence in the traits among populations may track environmental differences. There was no significant correlation between genetic variability at quantitative traits and microsatellite markers within populations. The site-of-origin of eco-geographical factors explain between 18.13% and 23.40% of genetic variance among populations at quantitative traits and microsatellite markers, respectively. The environmental factors that most influence variation in measured traits among populations are assimilated phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>0<sub>5</sub>) and mean annual rainfall, followed by climate and soil texture, altitude and organic matter. Significant associations between eco-geographical factors and gene diversity, $H_{e}$, were established in five-microsatellite loci suggesting that these simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are not necessarily biologically neutral.</p>

				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0321-0325</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The theory of evolution is perceived by many people, particularly but not only in the United States, as a controversial theory not yet fully demonstrated. Yet, that living organisms, including humans, have evolved from ancestors who were very different from them is beyond reasonable doubt, confirmed by at least as much evidence as any other widely accepted scientific theory. I argue that Darwin‚Äôs contribution to science goes much beyond the theory of evolution in itself. The theory of natural selection explains the adaptations of organisms, their ‚Äòdesign‚Äô. The ‚ÄòCopernican Revolution‚Äô brought the phenomena of the physical universe into the realm of science: explanations by natural causes that can be tested by observation and experiment. However, the scientific revolution that occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries had left the living world out of scientific explanations, because organisms seemingly show that they are ‚Äòdesigned,‚Äô and thus call for an intentional designer. It was Darwin‚Äôs greatest contribution to science, to demonstrate that the adaptations of organisms, their apparent ‚Äòdesign‚Äô, can be explained by natural processes governed by natural laws. At that point, science came into maturity, because all natural phenomena in the universe, living as well as nonliving, could be investigated scientifically, and explained as matter in motion governed by natural laws.</p>

				<title>The molecular basis of speciation: from patterns to processes, rules to mechanisms</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0327-0338</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The empirical study of speciation has brought us closer to unlocking the origins of life‚Äôs vast diversity. By examining recently formed species, a number of general patterns, or rules, become apparent. Among fixed differences between species, sexual genes and traits are one of the most rapidly evolving and novel functional classes, and premating isolation often develops earlier than postmating isolation. Among interspecific hybrids, sterility evolves faster than inviability, the X-chromosome has a greater effect on incompatibilities than autosomes, and hybrid dysfunction affects the heterogametic sex more frequently than the homogametic sex (Haldane‚Äôs rule). Haldane‚Äôs rule, in particular, has played a major role in reviving interest in the genetics of speciation. However, the large genetic and reproductive differences between taxa and the multi-factorial nature of each rule have made it difficult to ascribe general mechanisms. Here, we review the extensive progress made since Darwin on understanding the origin of species. We revisit the rules of speciation, regarding them as landmarks as species evolve through time. We contrast these ‚Äòrules‚Äô of speciation to ‚Äòmechanisms‚Äô of speciation representing primary causal factors ranging across various levels of organization‚Äîfrom genic to chromosomal to organismal. To explain the rules, we propose a new ‚Äòhierarchical faster-sex‚Äô theory: the rapid evolution of sex and reproduction-related (SRR) genes (faster-SRR evolution), in combination with the preferential involvement of the X-chromosome (hemizygous X-effects) and sexually selected male traits (faster-male evolution). This unified theory explains a comprehensive set of speciation rules at both the prezyotic and postzygotic levels and also serves as a cohesive alternative to dominance, composite, and recent genomic conflict interpretations of Haldane‚Äôs rule.</p>

				<title>Defining fitness in evolutionary models</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0339-0348</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The analysis of evolutionary models requires an appropriate definition for fitness. In this paper, I review such definitions in relation to the five major dimensions by which models may be described, namely</p>
					<ol>
						<li>finite versus infinite (or very large) population size,</li>
						<li>type of environment (constant, fixed length, temporally stochastic, temporally predictable, spatially stochastic, spatially predictable and social environment),</li>
						<li>density-independent or density-dependent,</li>
						<li>inherent population dynamics (equilibrium, cyclical and chaotic), and</li>
						<li>frequency-dependent or independent.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>In simple models, the Malthusian parameter ‚Äòùëü‚Äô or the net reproductive rate $R_0$ may be satisfactory, but once density-dependence or complex population dynamics is introduced the invasion exponent should be used. Defining fitness in a social environment or when there is frequency-dependence requires special consideration.</p>

				<title>Maintaining evolvability</title>
				<feature>Perspectives</feature>
				<page>0349-0353</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although molecular methods, such as QTL mapping, have revealed a number of loci with large effects, it is still likely that the bulk of quantitative variability is due to multiple factors, each with small effect. Typically, these have a large additive component. Conventional wisdom argues that selection, natural or artificial, uses up additive variance and thus depletes its supply. Over time, the variance should be reduced, and at equilibrium be near zero. This is especially expected for fitness and traits highly correlated with it. Yet, populations typically have a great deal of additive variance, and do not seem to run out of genetic variability even after many generations of directional selection. Long-term selection experiments show that populations continue to retain seemingly undiminished additive variance despite large changes in the mean value. I propose that there are several reasons for this.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The environment is continually changing so that what was formerly most fit no longer is.</li>
						<li>There is an input of genetic variance from mutation, and sometimes from migration.</li>
						<li>As intermediate-frequency alleles increase in frequency towards one, producing less variance (as $p \to 1$, $p(1 - p) \to 0$), others that were originally near zero become more common and increase the variance. Thus, a roughly constant variance is maintained.</li>
						<li>There is always selection for fitness and for characters closely related to it.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>To the extent that the trait is heritable, later generations inherit a disproportionate number of genes acting additively on the trait, thus increasing genetic variance. For these reasons a selected population retains its ability to evolve. Of course, genes with large effect are also important. Conspicuous examples are the small number of loci that changed teosinte to maize, and major phylogenetic changes in the animal kingdom. The relative importance of these along with duplications, chromosome rearrangements, horizontal transmission and polyploidy is yet to be determined. It is likely that only a case-by-case analysis will provide the answers. Despite the difficulties that complex interactions cause for evolution in Mendelian populations, such populations nevertheless evolve very well. Long-lasting species must have evolved mechanisms for coping with such problems. Since such difficulties do not arise in asexual populations, a comparison of epistatic patterns in closely related sexual and asexual species might provide some important insights.</p>

				<title>Genotype‚Äìenvironment interaction for total fitness in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0355-0362</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A fundamental assumption of models for the maintenance of genetic variation by environmental heterogeneity is that selection favours different genotypes in different environments. Here, I use a method for measuring total fitness of chromosomal heterozygotes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to assess genotype‚Äìenvironment interaction for fitness across two ecologically relevant environments, medium with and without added ethanol. Two-third chromosomes are compared, one from a population selected for ethanol tolerance, and the other from a control population. The results show strong crossing of reaction norms for outbred, total fitness, with the chromosome from the ethanol-adapted population increasing fitness on ethanol-supplemented food, but decreasing fitness on regular food, relative to the chromosome from the control population. Although I did not map the fitness effects below the chromosome level, the method could be adapted for quantitative trait locus mapping, to determine whether a substantial proportion of fitness variation is contributed by loci at which different alleles are favoured in different environments.</p>

				<title>Evolution of ageing since Darwin</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0363-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the late 19th century, the evolutionary approach to the problem of ageing was initiated by August Weismann, who argued that natural selection was more important for ageing than any physiological mechanism. In the mid-twentieth century, J. B. S. Haldane, P. B. Medawar and G. C. Williams informally argued that the force of natural selection falls with adult age. In 1966, W. D. Hamilton published formal equations that showed mathematically that two ‚Äòforces of natural selection‚Äô do indeed decline with age, though his analysis was not genetically explicit. Brian Charlesworth then developed the required mathematical population genetics for the evolution of ageing in the 1970‚Äôs. In the 1980‚Äôs, experiments using <i>Drosophila</i> showed that the rate of ageing evolves as predicted by Hamilton‚Äôs ‚Äòforces of natural selection‚Äô. The discovery of the cessation of ageing late in life in the 1990‚Äôs was followed by its explanation in terms of evolutionary theory based on Hamilton‚Äôs forces. Recently, it has been shown that the cessation of ageing can also be manipulated experimentally using Hamilton‚Äôs ‚Äòforces of natural selection‚Äô. Despite the success of evolutionary research on ageing, mainstream gerontological research has largely ignored both this work and the opportunity that it provides for effective intervention in ageing.</p>

				<title>Quantitative morphometrical analysis of a North African population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: sexual dimorphism, and comparison with European populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0373-0382</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variability of quantitative traits was investigated in aMoroccan population of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, with an isofemale line design. Results were compared with data previously obtained from French populations. Although the environmental and thermal conditions are very different in France and Morocco, only two significant differences were observed: a shorter wing and a lighter abdomen pigmentation in Morocco. It is, therefore, concluded that Moroccan <i>D. melanogaster</i> are quite typical temperate flies, belonging to the Palaearctic region, and very different from the ancestral Afrotropical populations. Almost all traits were genetically variable, as shown by significant intraclass correlations among lines. Genetic correlations were highly significant among three size-related traits, while much lower between size and bristle numbers. Fluctuating asymmetry was greater for abdominal bristles than for sternopleural bristles. Sex dimorphism, analysed as a female/male ratio, was identical in French and Moroccan populations. Examination of the thorax length/thorax width ratio showed that the thorax is more elongated in females. Sexual dimorphism of wing length was significantly more correlated to thorax width than to thorax length. The results illustrate the value of measuring numerous quantitative traits on the same flies for characterizing the genetic architecture of a natural population. In several cases, and especially for genetic correlations, some interesting suggestions could be made, which should be confirmed, or invalidated, by more extensive investigations.</p>

				<title>Sexual conflict and environmental change: trade-offs within and between the sexes during the evolution of desiccation resistance</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0383-0394</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when males and females experience sex-specific selection on a shared genome. With several notable exceptions, intralocus sexual conflict has been investigated in constant environments to which the study organisms have had an opportunity to adapt. However, a change in the environment can result in differential or even opposing selection pressures on males and females, creating sexual conflict. We used experimental evolution to explore the interaction between intralocus sexual conflict, sexual dimorphism and environmental variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six populations were selected for adult desiccation resistance (D), with six matched control populations maintained in parallel (C). After 46 generations, the D populations had increased in survival time under arid conditions by 68% and in body weight by 20% compared to the C populations. The increase in size was the result of both extended development and faster growth rate of D juveniles. Adaptation to the stress came at a cost in terms of preadult viability and female fecundity. Because males are innately less tolerant of desiccation stress, very few D males survived desiccation-selection; while potentially a windfall for survivors, these conditions mean that most males‚Äô fitness was determined posthumously. We conjectured that selection for early maturation and mating in males was in conflict with selection for survival and later reproduction in females. Consistent with this prediction, the sexes showed different patterns of age-specific desiccation resistance and resource acquisition, and there was a trend towards increasingly female-biased sexual size dimorphism. However, levels of desiccation resistance were unaffected, with D males and females increasing in parallel. Either there is a strong positive genetic correlation between the sexes that limits independent evolution of desiccation resistance, or fitness pay-offs from the strategy of riding out the stress bout are great enough to sustain concordant selection on the two sexes. We discuss the forces that mould fitness in males under a regimen where trade-offs between survival and reproduction may be considerable.</p>

				<title>Potential constraints on evolution: sexual dimorphism and the problem of protandry in the butterfly <i>Bicyclus anynana</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0395-0405</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The earlier mean adult emergence between males and females, protandry, has been well studied mathematically and in comparative studies. However, quantitative and evolutionary genetic research on protandry is scarce. The butterfly, <i>Bicyclus anynana</i> exhibits protandry and here we selected for each of the different combinations of male and female development time in this species, thus including direct selection on protandry (i.e., FAST, fast males and fast females; SLOW, slow males and slow females; FMSF, fast males and slow females; and SMFF, slow males and fast females). After eight generations of selection there was no significant response for increased or decreased protandry, whereas selection for increased or decreased development time in both sexes (FAST or SLOW) was successful. Continued selection (&#62; 30 generations) for decreased or increased protandry showed a significant difference between the FMSF<sub>C</sub> and SMFF<sub>C</sub> lines (subscript c for continued selection), which was of the same magnitude as the nonsignificant difference observed between the FMSF and SMFF lines at generation eight. This indicated that the initial selection was successful, but that the difference between the lines did not increase with continued selection. Our results also indicate that the genetic covariance across sexes for development time is near unity. Interestingly, lines selected for decreased protandry (SMFF) had lower egg-to-adult survival, and broods from these lines had lower rates of egg hatching. This suggests that interactions with fertility might constrain certain directions of change in patterns of protandry. Moreover, selection yielded a change in the ratio of male to female development time for slow lines, suggesting that some amount of sex-specific genetic variance for development time is still present in this population. The FMSF<sub>C</sub> line showed the largest effect of selection on protandry, mainly through an effect on female developmental time. Lastly, our results show that temperature has an effect on the amount of protandry in the selected lines. These results are discussed in relation to the ecology of this species and the evolution of protandry.</p>

				<title>Multidimensional analysis of <i>Drosophila</i> wing variation in Evolution Canyon</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0407-0419</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Environmental stress has been suggested to be a major evolutionary force, both through inducing strong selection and because of its direct impact on developmental buffering processes that alter the evolvability of organisms. In particular, temperature has attracted much attention because of its importance as an ecological feature and the relative ease with which it can be experimentally manipulated in the lab. Evolution Canyon, Lower Nahal Oren, Israel, is a well studied natural site where ecological parameters are suspected to drive evolutionary differentiation. In this study, using Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines derived from wild flies collected on both slopes of the canyon, we investigated the effect of developmental temperature upon the different components of phenotypic variation of a complex trait: the wing. Combining geometric and traditional morphometrics, we find only limited evidence for a differentiation among slopes. Investigating simultaneously phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation among isofemale lines, variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, we could not identify a consistent effect of the stressful conditions encountered on the south facing slope. The prevailing structuring effect is that of the experimentally manipulated temperature which clearly influences wing mean size and shape. Variability, in contrast, is not consistently affected by temperature. Finally, we investigated the specific relationship between individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry. Using metric multi-dimensional scaling we show that the related patterns of wing shape variation are not identical, supporting the view that the underlying developmental processes are to a certain extent different.</p>

				<title>The simplest formal argument for fitness optimization</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0421-0433</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Formal Darwinism Project aims to provide a formal argument linking population genetics to fitness optimization, which of necessity includes defining fitness. This bridges the gulf between those biologists who assume that natural selection leads to something close to fitness optimization and those biologists who believe on theoretical grounds that there is no sense of fitness that can usefully be said to be optimized. The current paper‚Äôs main objective is to provide a careful mathematical introduction to the project, and it also reflects on the project‚Äôs scope and limitations. The central argument is the proof of close ties between the mathematics of motion, as embodied in the Price equation, and the mathematics of optimization, as represented by optimization programmes. To make these links, a general and abstract model linking genotype, phenotype and number of successful gametes is assumed. The project has begun with simple dynamic models and simple linking models, and its progress will involve more realistic versions of them. The versions given here are fully mathematically rigorous, but elementary enough to serve as an introduction.</p>

				<title>Energy-responsive timekeeping</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0447-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An essential component of energy homeostasis lies in an organism‚Äôs ability to coordinate daily patterns in activity, feeding, energy utilization and energy storage across the daily 24-h cycle. Most tissues of the body contain the molecular clock machinery required for circadian oscillation and rhythmic gene expression. Under normal circumstances, behavioural and physiological rhythms are orchestrated and synchronized by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, considered to be the master circadian clock. However, metabolic processes are easily decoupled from the primarily light-driven SCN when food intake is desynchronized from normal diurnal patterns of activity. This dissociation from SCN based timing demonstrates that the circadian system is responsive to changes in energy supply and metabolic status. There has long been evidence for the existence of an anatomically distinct and autonomous food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) that can govern behavioural rhythms, when feeding becomes the dominant entraining stimulus. But now rapidly growing evidence suggests that core circadian clock genes are involved in reciprocal transcriptional feedback with genetic regulators of metabolism, and are directly responsive to cellular energy supply. This close interaction is likely to be critical for normal circadian regulation of metabolism, and may also underlie the disruption of proper metabolic rhythms observed in metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type-II diabetes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Circadian clocks are thought to regulate retinal physiology in anticipation of the large variation in environmental irradiance associated with the earth‚Äôs rotation upon its axis. In this review we discuss some of the rhythmic events that occur in the mammalian retina, and their consequences for retinal physiology. We also review methods of tracing retinal rhythmicity <i>in vivo</i> and highlight the electroretinogram (ERG) as a useful technique in this field. Principally, we discuss how this technique can be used as a quick and noninvasive way of assessing physiological changes that occur in the retina over the course of the day. We highlight some important recent findings facilitated by this approach and discuss its strengths and limitations.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>In mammals, the mechanism for the generation of circadian rhythms and entrainment by light‚Äìdark (LD) cycles resides in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and the principal signal that adjusts this biological clock with environmental timing is the light:dark cycle. Within the SCN, rhythms are generated by a complex of molecular feedback loops that regulate the transcription of clock genes, including <i>per</i> and <i>cry</i>. Posttranslational modification plays an essential role in the regulation of biological rhythms; in particular, clock gene phosphorylation by casein kinase I, both epsilon (CKIùúñ) and delta (CKIùõø), regulates key molecular mechanisms in the circadian clock. In this paper, we report for the first time that CKI activity undergoes a significant circadian rhythm in the SCN (peaking at circadian time 12, the start of the subjective night), and its pharmacological inhibition alters photic entrainment of the clock, indicating that CKI may be a key element in this pathway.</p>

				<title>Is vertical migration in Antarctic krill (<i>Euphausia superba</i>) influenced by an underlying circadian rhythm?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0473-0483</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Antarctic krill (<i>Euphausia superba</i>) is a keystone species in the southern ocean ecosystem where it is the main consumer of phytoplankton and constitutes the main food item of many higher predators. Both food and predators are most abundant at the surface, thus krill hide in the depth of the ocean during the day and migrate to the upper layers at night, to feed at a time when the predatory risk is lowest. Although the functional significance of this diel vertical migration (DVM) is clear and its modulation by environmental factors has been described, the involvement of an endogenous circadian clock in this behaviour is as yet not fully resolved. We have analysed the circadian behaviour of <i>Euphausia superba</i> in a laboratory setting and here we present the first description of locomotor activity rhythms for this species. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the circadian clock plays a key role in DVM. They also suggest that the interplay between food availability, social cues and the light:dark cycle acts as the predominant <i>Zeitgeber</i> for DVM in this species.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>As an experimental model system, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> has been seminal in shaping our understanding of the circadian clockwork. The wealth of genetic tools at our disposal over the past four decades has enabled discovery of the genetic and molecular bases of circadian rhythmicity. More recently, detailed investigation leading to the anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological characterization of the various neuronal subgroups that comprise the circadian machinery has revealed pathways through which these neurons come together to act as a neuronal circuit. Thus the <i>D. melanogaster</i> circadian pacemaker circuit presents a relatively simple and attractive model for the study of neuronal circuits and their functions.</p>

				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0495-0504</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Extensive research has been carried out to understand how circadian clocks regulate various physiological processes in organisms. The discovery of clock genes and the molecular clockwork has helped researchers to understand the possible role of these genes in regulating various metabolic processes. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, many studies have shown that the basic architecture of circadian clocks is multi-oscillatory. In nature, different neuronal subgroups in the brain of <i>D. melanogaster</i> have been demonstrated to control different circadian behavioural rhythms or different aspects of the same circadian rhythm. Among the circadian phenomena that have been studied so far in <i>Drosophila</i>, the egg-laying rhythm is unique, and relatively less explored. Unlike most other circadian rhythms, the egg-laying rhythm is rhythmic under constant light conditions, and the endogenous or free-running period of the rhythm is greater than those of most other rhythms. Although the clock genes and neurons required for the persistence of adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms have been studied extensively, those underlying the circadian egg-laying rhythm still remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the circadian egg-laying rhythm in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, and the possible molecular and physiological mechanisms that control the rhythmic output of the egg-laying process.</p>

				<title>The role of microRNAs (miRNA) in circadian rhythmicity</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0505-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MicroRNA (miRNA) is a recently discovered new class of small RNA molecules that have a significant role in regulating gene and protein expression. These small RNAs (‚àº22 nt) bind to 3&#8242; untranslated regions (3&#8242;UTRs) and induce degradation or repression of translation of their mRNA targets. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in various organisms and have been shown to play a significant role in development and normal cell functioning. Recently, a few studies have suggested that miRNAs may be an important regulators of circadian rhythmicity, providing a new dimension (posttranscriptional) of our understanding of biological clocks. Here, we describe the mechanisms of miRNA regulation, and recent studies attempting to identify clock miRNAs and their function in the circadian system.</p>

				<title>Phenotypic effects of genetic variability in human clock genes on circadian and sleep parameters</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0513-0519</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Circadian rhythms and sleep are two separate but intimately related processes. Circadian rhythms are generated through the precisely controlled, cyclic expression of a number of genes designated clock genes. Genetic variability in these genes has been associated with a number of phenotypic differences in circadian as well as sleep parameters, both in mouse models and in humans. Diurnal preferences as determined by the selfreported Horne‚Äì√ñstberg (H√ñ) questionnaire, has been associated with polymorphisms in the human genes <i>CLOCK, PER1, PER2</i> and <i>PER3</i>. Circadian rhythm-related sleep disorders have also been associated with mutations and polymorphisms in clock genes, with the advanced type cosegrating in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with mutations in the genes <i>PER2</i> and <i>CSNK1D</i>, and the delayed type associating without discernible Mendelian inheritance with polymorphisms in <i>CLOCK</i> and <i>PER3</i>. Several mouse models of clock gene null alleles have been demonstrated to have affected sleep homeostasis. Recent findings have shown that the variable number tandem polymorphism in <i>PER3</i>, previously linked to diurnal preference, has profound effects on sleep homeostasis and cognitive performance following sleep loss, confirming the close association between the processes of circadian rhythms and sleep at the genetic level.</p>

				<title>Remarkable evolutionary conservation of SOX14 orthologues</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0015-0024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>SOX proteins constitute a large family of diverse, well-conserved transcription factors present in vertebrates and invertebrates, and also implicated in control of many developmental processes. Our objectives have been to identify <i>Sox14</i> gene of goat (<i>Capra hircus</i>), cow (<i>Bos taurus</i>) and rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), and to perform comparative analyses and mapping of SOX14 orthologues from numerous vertebrate species. PCR based approach was used to identify <i>Sox14</i> of goat, cow and rat, while nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments and mapping were performed using information currently available in public database. Comparative sequence analysis revealed remarkable identity among <i>Sox14</i> orthologues and helped us to identify highly conserved motifs that represent molecular signatures of SOX14 protein that might have structural or functional significance. Further, we determined chromosomal locations of numerous predicted group B <i>Sox</i> genes and their neighbouring genes using currently available genome database. In conclusion, our study has not only supported the proposed model of group B <i>Sox</i> genes evolution in chicken and mammals, but has also revealed that additional evolutionary events split <i>Sox</i> B genes into different chromosomes in some mammals. Mapping data presented in this study could help in refining the understanding of the evolution of group B <i>Sox</i> genes in vertebrates.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The mating system and seed variation of <i>Acacia</i> hybrid (<i>A. mangium</i> &#215; <i>A. auriculiformis</i>) were studied using allozymes and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, respectively. Multi-locus outcrossing rate estimations indicated that the hybrid was predominantly outcrossed (mean¬±s.e. $t_{m} = 0.86\pm 0.01$). Seed variation was investigated using 35 polymorphic RAPD fragments. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed the highest genetic variation among seeds within a pod (66%‚Äì70%), followed by among pods within inflorescence (29%‚Äì37%), and the least variation among inflorescences within tree (&#60; 1%). In addition, two to four RAPD profiles could be detected among seeds within pod. Therefore, the results suggest that a maximum of four seeds per pod could be sampled for the establishment of a mapping population for further studies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>Neurospora crassa fmf-1</i> mutation exerts an unusual ‚Äòperithecium-dominant‚Äô developmental arrest; <i>fmf-1</i> &#215; <i>fmf-1<sup>+</sup></i> cross becomes arrested in perithecial development regardless of whether the mutant participates in the cross as the male or female parent. We localized <i>fmf-1</i> to the LG IL genome segment between the centromere-proximal breakpoint of the chromosome segment duplication <i>Dp(IL)39311</i> and the centromere. By mapping crossovers with respect to RFLP markers in this region we further localized <i>fmf-1</i> to an approximately 34-kb-genome segment. Partial sequencing of this segment revealed a point mutation in the gene <i>NCU 09387.1</i>, a homologue of the <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe ste11<sup>+</sup></i> regulator of sexual development. The <i>fmf-1</i> mutation did not complement a <i>NCU 09387.1</i> deletion mutation, and transformation with wild-type <i>NCU 09387.1</i> complemented <i>fmf-1. S. pombe</i> Ste11 protein (Ste 11p) is a transcription factor required for sexual differentiation and for the expression of genes required for mating pheromone signalling in <i>matP</i> and <i>matM</i> cells. If FMF-1 also plays a corresponding role in mating pheromone signalling in <i>Neurospora</i>, then protoperithecia in an <i>fmf-1</i> &#215; <i>fmf-1<sup>+</sup></i> cross would be unable to either send or receive sexual differentiation signals and thus become arrested in development.</p>

					<p>Somatostatin and its receptors have a critical role in mammalian growth through their control pattern of secretion of growth hormone, but the evolutionary history of somatostatin and somatostatin receptors are ill defined. We used comparative whole genome analysis of <i>Danio rerio, Carassius auratus, Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus, Monodelphis domestica, Homo sapiens, Sus scrofa, Bos taurus, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis lupus familiaris, Ovis aries, Equus caballus, Pan troglodytes</i> and <i>Macaca mulatto</i> to identify somatostatin and somatostatin receptors in each species. To date, we have identified a minimum of two genes of somatostatin and five somatostatin receptor genes in mammalian species with variable forms. We established a clear evolutionary history of the somatostatin system and traced the origin of the somatostatin system to 395 million years ago (MYA), identifying critical steps in their evolution.</p>

				<page>0055-0060</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stratification in heterogeneous populations poses an enormous challenge in linkage disequilibrium (LD) based identification of causal loci using surrogate markers. In this study, we demonstrate the enormous potential of endogamous Indian populations for mapping mutations in candidate genes using minimal SNPs, mainly due to larger regions of LD. We show this by a case study of the <i>PPP2R2B</i> gene (‚àº400 kb) that harbours a CAG repeat, expansion of which has been implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12). Using LD information derived from Indian Genome Variation database (IGVdb) on populations which share similar ethnic and linguistic backgrounds as the SCA12 study population, we could map the causal loci using a minimal set of three SNPs, without the generation of additional basal data from the ethnically matched population. We could also demonstrate transferability of tagSNPs from a related HapMap population for mapping the mutation.</p>

				<title>QTL identification of grain protein concentration and its genetic correlation with starch concentration and grain weight using two populations in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0061-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Protein is one of the three main storage chemical components in maize grains, and is negatively correlated with starch concentration (SC). Our objective was to analyse the influence of genetic backgrounds on QTL detection for protein concentration (PC) and to reveal the molecular genetic associations between PC and both SC and grain weight (GWP). Two hundred and eighty-four (Pop1) and 265 (Pop2) F<sub>2:3</sub> families were developed from two crosses between one high-oil maize inbred GY220 and two normal maize inbreds 8984 and 8622 respectively, and were genotyped with 185 and 173 pairs of SSR markers. PC, SC and GWP were evaluated under two environments. Composite interval mapping (CIM) and multiple interval mapping (MIM) methods were used to detect single-trait QTL for PC, and multiple-trait QTL for PC with both SC and GWP. No common QTL were shared between the two populations for their four and one PC QTL. Common QTL with opposite signs of effects for PC and SC/GWP were detected on three marker intervals at bins 6.07‚Äì6.08, 8.03 and 8.03‚Äì8.04. Multiple-traits QTL mapping showed that tightly-linked QTL, pleiotropic QTL and QTL having effects with opposite directions for PC and SC/GWP were all observed in Pop1, while all QTL reflected opposite effects in Pop2.</p>

				<title>Cytogenetic study of <i>Ascaris</i> trypsin inhibitor in cultured human lymphocytes with metabolic activation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0069-0075</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The trypsin inhibitor (ATI) isolated from gastrointestinal nematode <i>Ascaris suum</i> was tested <i>in vitro</i> for induction of chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE). Genotoxicity assessment of purified ATI was carried out on metaphase plates received from peripheral blood lymphocyte macroculture (48 h test of structural chromosome aberrations and 72 h test of SCE) with exogenous metabolic activation. ATI was tested in dose of 25, 50 and 100 Œºg per ml of culture. Kinetics of cell divisions were determined by the replication index (RI). The mitotic index (MI) was expressed as a number of metaphases per 1000 nuclei analysed. Analysis of chromosome aberrations showed that higher doses of ATI (50 and 100 ùúá/ml) significantly increased the frequency of chromosome aberrations (mainly of chromatid gaps and breaks) compared to the negative control. All concentrations of ATI caused a statistically significant reduction in the MI and RI. In comparison with the negative control, a significant increase in the SCE frequency was observed in all applied doses of ATI. Thus, in the presence of S9 activation, the Ascaris trypsin inhibitor showed potential clastogenic activity and inhibition of the dynamics of lymphocyte divisions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Indian subcontinent harbours both the human mtDNA macrohaplogroups M and N, of which M is the most prevalent. In this study, we discuss the overall distribution of the various haplogroups and sub-haplogroups of M among the different castes and tribes to understand their diverse pattern with respect to geographical location and linguistic affiliation of the populations. An overview of about 170 studied populations, belonging to four distinct linguistic families and inhabiting different geographic zones, revealed wide diversity of about 22 major haplogroups of M. The tribal populations belonging to the same linguistic family but inhabiting different geographical regions (Dravidian and Austro‚ÄìAsiatic speakers) exhibited differences in their haplogroup diversity. The northern and southern region castes showed greater diversity than the castes of other regions.</p>

				<title>Identification of <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> genes involved in asexual sporogenesis</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0141-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in asexual spore development in <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>, the zoospores of strain PS26 were treated with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. After selection, a mutant progeny, termed PS26-U03, was obtained and demonstrated to exhibit no oospore production. A suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach was developed to investigate differences in gene expression between PS26 and PS26-U03 during asexual sporogenesis. Of the 126 sequences chosen for examination, 39 putative unigenes were identified that exhibit high expression in PS26. These sequences are predicted to encode proteins involved in metabolism, cell cycle, protein biosynthesis, cell signalling, cell defence, and transcription regulation. Seven clones were selected for temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR based on the results of the dot-blot screens. Three of the selected genes, developmental protein DG1037 (<i>UB88</i>), glycoside hydrolase (<i>UB149</i>) and a hypothetical protein (<i>UB145</i>), were expressed only in PS26, whereas the transcripts of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (<i>UB36</i>), FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase (<i>UB226</i>) and sugar transporter (<i>UB256</i>) were expressed at very low levels in PS26-U03 but at high levels in PS26.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Patients with <i>de novo</i> acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and near-tetraploid or completely tetraploid karyotype at presentation are rare. We present four patients with near-tetraploidy/tetraploidy in a cohort of 426 consecutive AML patients (0.98%) in respect to their cytogenetic findings, immunophenotype pattern, response to chemotherapy, course of disease and molecular analyses including tyrosine kinase receptor <i>FLT3</i> gene, <i>NRAS</i> gene, and tumour suppressor gene, <i>p53</i>. We have found <i>FLT3/ITD</i> mutation only in one patient among the four with near-tetraploidy. The main finding is that these patients had a variable clinical course, with two having a long period of remission (36 and 12 months) and two died, not having achieved remission.</p>

				<title>Genetic characterization of <i>Perna viridis</i> L. in peninsular Malaysia using microsatellite markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0153-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A total of 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to analyse levels of genetic variation for 10 populations of <i>Perna viridis</i> L. collected from all over peninsular Malaysia. The populations involved in this study included Pulau Aman in Penang, Tanjung Rhu in Kedah, Bagan Tiang in Perak, Pulau Ketam in Selangor, Muar, Parit Jawa, Pantai Lido and Kampung Pasir Puteh in Johore, and Kuala Pontian and Nenasi in Pahang state. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to seven, with an average of 3.1. Heterozygote deficiencies were observed across all the 10 populations. Characterization of the populations revealed that local populations of <i>P. viridis</i> in peninsular Malaysia were genetically similar enough to be used as a biomonitoring agent for heavy metal contamination in the Straits of Malacca. Cluster analysis grouped the <i>P. viridis</i> populations according to their geographical distributions with the exception of Parit Jawa. The analysis also revealed that <i>P. viridis</i> from the northern parts of peninsular Malaysia were found to be the most distant populations among the populations of mussels investigated and <i>P. viridis</i> from the eastern part of peninsular Malaysia were closer to the central and southern populations than to the northern populations.</p>

				<title>Dwarf mutations in grass pea (<i>Lathyrus sativus</i> L.): origin, morphology, inheritance and linkage studies</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0165-0175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Induction of mutation has been used to create additional genetic variability in grass pea (<i>Lathyrus sativus</i> L.). During the ongoing investigations on different induced-morphological mutants, the author detected three types of dwarf mutants in grass pea. One mutant, designated as <i>dwf1</i> type was earlier identified in colchicine-induced C<sub>2</sub> generation of grass pea variety BioR-231 while the other two, designated as <i>dwf2</i> and <i>dwf3</i> were isolated in 250 Gy and 300 Gy gamma ray irradiated M<sub>2</sub> progeny of variety ‚ÄòBioR-231‚Äô and ‚ÄòHooghly Local‚Äô, respectively. As compared to their parental varieties (controls), all the three mutants manifested stunted, erect and determinate stem, early maturity and tolerance to pod shattering habit. The mutants differed from each other, as well as with controls, in number of primary branches, nature of stipules and internodes, length of peduncle, leaflet and seed coat colour, seed yield and seed neurotoxin content. The three dwarf mutants were monogenically recessive and bred true in successive generations. F<sub>2</sub> segregation pattern obtained from the crosses involving the three mutants indicated that dwarf mutation in grass pea was controlled by two independent non-allelic genes, assigned as <i>df1</i> (for <i>dwf1</i> type), <i>df2</i> (for <i>dwf2</i> type) and <i>df3</i> (for <i>dwf3</i> type), with the <i>df1</i> locus being multiple allelic. Primary trisomic analyses revealed the presence of <i>df1/df2</i> locus on the extra chromosome of trisomic type I, whereas <i>df3</i> was located on the extra chromosome of type III. Linkage studies involving five other phenotypic markers suggested linked association of <i>df1/df2</i> locus with <i>lfc</i> (leaflet colour) and <i>wgn</i> (winged internode) and <i>df3</i> locus with <i>cbl</i> (seed coat colour). Both the loci; however, assorted independently with flower colour and stipule character. The dwarf types can be utilized as valuable tools for further cytogenetic research and breeding of grass pea.</p>

				<title>Cytogenetic characterization of <i>Eurysternus caribaeus</i> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae): evidence of sex-autosome fusion and diploid number reduction prior to species dispersion</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0177-0182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mitotic and meiotic chromosomes of several populations of <i>Eurysternus caribaeus</i> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) were analysed through conventional staining, C-banding, base-specific fluorochromes, silver nitrate staining and fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH). All specimens showed $2n = 8$ in their karyotypes, with a neo-XY sex system (Y is a submetacentric and X a metacentric) and three pairs of submetacentric autosomes. The analysis of constitutive heterochromatin (CH) revealed small blocks located in the centromeric region of all chromosomes which do not present positive staining under the fluorochromes CMA<sub>3</sub> and DAPI. Silver nitrate staining revealed that the nucleolar organizer region (NORs) is associated with the sex chromosomes. The FISH technique revealed that rDNA sites in the X and Y are different in size. Data from different populations indicate that the diploid number reduction $(2n = 8)$ observed in <i>E. caribaeus</i> is established and presumably has preceded the dispersion of this species. Moreover, this reduction occasioned the translocation of rDNA sites to the sex chromosomes, X and Y, an uncommon pattern in Scarabaeidae that was observed for the first time by the FISH in this work.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chlorophyll content were studied using a doubled haploid (DH) population with 168 progeny lines, derived from a cross between two elite Chinese wheat cultivars Huapei 3 &#215; Yumai 57. Chlorophyll content was evaluated at the maximum tillering stage (MS), the heading stage (HS), and the grain filling stage (GS), at three different environments in 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons. QTL analyses were performed using a mixed linear model approach. A total of 17 additive QTLs and nine pairs of epistatic QTLs were detected. Ten of 17 additive QTLs for chlorophyll content were persistently expressed at more than two growth stages, which suggest developmentally regulated loci controlling genetics for chlorophyll content in different growth stages in wheat. One novel major QTL for chlorophyll content was closely linked with the PCR marker <i>Xwmc215</i> and was persistently expressed at three growth stages.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Multiple studies have shown that IL23 cytokine plays an essential role in the development of autoimmune diseases by activating IL17-producing helper T (Th17) cells. Given that the susceptibility loci in <i>IL23R</i> for Crohn‚Äôs disease (CD) is present in Western population and not in Asian population; we screened the <i>IL23R</i> gene by DNA sequencing to identify susceptibility loci in a selected CD cohort and confirmed it in all our subjects (134 CD and 131 controls). A novel nonsynonymous SNP (p.Gly149Arg, c.445G&#62;A) and 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Among them, only <i>rs11465788</i> was implicated in CD susceptibility (P = 4.9 &#215; 10<sup>-4</sup>, OR = 0.30). Genotype‚Äìphenotypic interaction analysis showed that <i>rs11465788</i> is associated with nonstricturing and nonpenetrating disease behaviour in CD patients ($P = 0.015$). Our results provide the evidence that <i>rs11465788</i> may influence the susceptibility and clinical features of CD in Chinese population.</p>

				<title>Analysis of genetic structure and relationship among nine indigenous Chinese chicken populations by the <i>Structure</i> program</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0197-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The multi-locus model-based clustering method <i>Structure</i> program was used to infer the genetic structure of nine indigenous Chinese chicken (<i>Gallus gallus</i>) populations based on 16 microsatellite markers. Twenty runs were carried out at each chosen value of predefined cluster numbers $(K)$ under admixture model. The <i>Structure</i> program properly inferred the presence of genetic structure with 0.999 probabilities. The genetic structure not only indicated that the nine kinds of chicken populations were defined actually by their locations, phenotypes or culture, but also reflected the underlying genetic variations. At $K = 2$, nine chicken populations were divided into two main clusters, one light-body type, including Chahua chicken (CHA), Tibet chicken (TIB), Xianju chicken (XIA), Gushi chicken (GUS) and Baier chicken (BAI); and the other heavy-body type, including Beijing You chicken (YOU), Xiaoshan chicken (XIA), Luyuan chicken (LUY) and Dagu chicken (DAG). GUS and DAG were divided into independent clusters respectively when ùêæ equaled 4, 5, or 6. XIA and BIA chicken, XIA and LUY chicken, TIB and CHA chicken still clustered together when ùêæ equaled 6, 7, and 8, respectively. These clustering results were consistent with the breeding directions of the nine chicken populations. The <i>Structure</i> program also identified migrants or admixed individuals. The admixed individuals were distributed in all the nine chicken populations, while migrants were only distributed in TIB, XIA and LUY populations. These results indicated that the clustering analysis using the <i>Structure</i> program might provide an accurate representation of the genetic relationship among the breeds.</p>

				<title>Upper petal lip colour polymorphism in <i>Collinsia heterophylla</i> (Plantaginaceae): genetic basis within a population and its use as a genetic marker</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0205-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Understanding the genetics of a polymorphic trait is important to predict its likely evolution. In <i>Collinsia heterophylla,</i> the upper petal lip colour can be either be white or white with a purple band, while the lower petal lip colour is invariably purple. Because the corolla is only partly polymorphic, the polymorphism can not have evolved due to a mutation where a pigment was lost in the entire plant, which is common in other polymorphic species. In a previous study, high frequency of the purple band was found in populations with darker flowers, indicating possible selection for this trait. In this study, I determined inheritance of the colour polymorphism using two populations (one with only white morph and other with both morphs). I conducted experimental crosses within and between floral morphs to determine whether patterns of segregation in offspring conform to single-gene predictions. Data from F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub> and backcross progeny are consistent with a genetic model of one major locus with presence of the band being completely dominant, as indicated in earlier studies using distantly related populations. A novel finding in this study was that the two morphs did not show a difference in seed germination frequency or seedling survival. This trait can thus be valuable as a genetic marker. Even though more thorough ecological data are needed to understand the potential selection pressures on upper petal lip colour in <i>C. heterophylla</i>, its simple inheritance may indicate the possibility of fast evolutionary response to selective forces acting on this trait.</p>

				<title>Mining of expressed sequence tag libraries of cacao for microsatellite markers using five computational tools</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0217-0225</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide researchers with a quick and inexpensive route for discovering new genes, data on gene expression and regulation, and also provide genic markers that help in constructing genome maps. Cacao is an important perennial crop of humid tropics. Cacao EST sequences, as available in the public domain, were downloaded and made into contigs. Microsatellites were located in these ESTs and contigs using five softwares (MISA, TRA, TROLL, SSRIT and SSR primer). MISA gave maximum coverage of SSRs in cacao ESTs and contigs, although TRA was able to detect higher order (&#62;5-mer) repeats. The frequency of SSRs was one per 26.9 kb in the known set of ESTs. One-third of the repeats in EST-contigs were found to be trimeric. A few rare repeats like 21-mer repeat were also located. A/T repeats were most abundant among the mononucleotide repeats and the AG/GA/TC/CT type was the most frequent among dimerics. Flanking primers were designed using Primer3 program and verified experimentally for PCR amplification. The results of the study are made available freely online database (http://riju.byethost31.com/cocoa/). Seven primer pairs amplified genomic DNA isolated from leaves were used to screen a representative set of 12 accessions of cacao.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0227-0232</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>multifoliate pinna</i> (<i>mfp</i>) mutation alters the leaf-blade architecture of pea, such that simple tendril pinnae of distal domain are replaced by compound pinna blades of tendrilled leaflets in mfp homozygotes. The <i>MFP</i> locus was mapped with reference to DNA markers using F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>2:5</sub> RIL as mapping populations. Among 205 RAPD, 27 ISSR and 35 SSR markers that demonstrated polymorphism between the parents of mapping populations, three RAPD markers were found linked to the <i>MFP</i> locus by bulk segregant analyses on <i>mfp/mfp</i> and <i>MFP/MFP</i> bulks assembled from the F<sub>2:5</sub> population. The segregational analysis of <i>mfp</i> and 267 DNA markers on 96 F<sub>2</sub> plants allowed placement of 26 DNA markers with reference to <i>MFP</i> on a linkage group. The existence of common markers on reference genetic maps and <i>MFP</i> linkage group developed here showed that <i>MFP</i> is located on linkage group IV of the consensus genetic map of pea.</p>

				<title>Detection of combined genomic variants in a Jordanian family with familial non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0233-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Five patients, four brothers and their paternal aunt, presented with a history of overt hyperthyroidism and goiter. Hyperthyroidism in this family was remarkable for its poor response to carbimazole (30‚Äì50 mg/d). The thyroid ultrasound showed a diffusely enlarged gland in all the affected members, and thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSAB) were negative. Screening for germline mutations in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (<i>TSHR</i>) gene was performed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of all family members. The sequence analysis of all <i>TSHR</i> gene exons and intron borders revealed two genomic variants. The first was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within exon seven (Asn187Asn), whereas the other was located in intron seven (IVS7+68T&#62;G). All affected members, two asymptomatic brothers with sub-clinical hyperthyroidism, and their father were heterozygous for those two genomic variants. Anti-thyroid drug treatment for several months successfully relieved symptoms in one subject, whereas the remaining patients required total thyroidectomy to control their disease. This is the first Jordanian family with familial non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism, with mutations affecting the <i>TSHR</i> gene.</p>

				<title>A case of Silver‚ÄìRussell syndrome (SRS): multiple pituitary hormone deficiency, lack of H19 hypomethylation and favourable growth hormone (GH) treatment response</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0239-0243</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) at the <i>IGF2/H19</i> locus on 11p15 is linked to Silver‚ÄìRussell syndrome (SRS) and/or hemihypertrophy. This SRS patient was born in term with weight of 3500 g (50 percentile) and length 48 cm (&#62;1 SD below the mean). He was first noticed at the age of 10 years for short stature (114.5 cm, $-3.85$ SD), relatively normal head circumference, a classic facial phenotype, hemihypertrophy (2.5 cm thinner left arm and leg in comparison to the right, asymmetric face), moderate clinodactyly and striking thinness (BMI of 15.3). At the age of 30, the body asymmetry ameliorated (1 cm thinner left arm and leg than the right), and BMI normalized (20.5 cm). Methylation analysis was performed by bisulphate treatment of DNA samples, radiolabelled PCR amplification, and digestion of the PCR products using restriction enzymes. The patient had normomethylation, and in addition hypopituitarism, with low levels of growth hormone (GH) (provocative testing before the start and after termination of GH treatment), thyroxin, TSH, FSH, LH and testosterone. The GH was given for six years, growth response was satisfactory and he reached an adult height of 166 cm. This is a first report of hypopituitarism in a patient with SRS without H19 hypomethylation. It seems that the lack of hypomethylation in this hypopituitary SRS patient is responsible, at least partly, for the favourable final adult height under GH treatment.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Genetically caused deafness is a common trait affecting one in 1000 children and is predominantly inherited in an autosomal-recessive fashion. Several mutations in the <i>GJB2</i> gene and a deletion of 342 kb in <i>GJB6</i> gene (del<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830) have been identified worldwide in patients with hearing impairment. In the present study, 303 nonsyndromic hearing-impaired patients (140 familial; 163 sporadic) were examined clinically and screened for mutations in <i>GJB2</i> and <i>GJB6</i> genes. Mutations in <i>GJB2</i> gene were found in 33 (10.9%) patients of whom six (18.2%) were carriers for the mutant allele. The most frequent mutation was p.W24X accounting for 87% of the mutant alleles. In addition, six other sequence variations were identified in the <i>GJB2</i> gene viz., c.IVS1+1G&#62;A, c.167delT, c.235delC, p.W77X, p.R127H (polymorphism), p.M163V. None of the samples showed del(<i>GJB6</i>-D13S1830) or any point mutations in <i>GJB6</i> gene.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of RAPD-PCR and protein profile analysis to differentiate <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> strains prevalent along the southwest coast of India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0273-0279</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sixty five isolates of <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> were subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis and protein profiling to investigate the genetic variability among <i>V. harveyi</i> prevalent along the coast and also assess the discriminating ability of these two molecular methods. A total of 10 RAPD primers were assayed for their specificity in detecting <i>V. harveyi</i>, of which only two primers: PM3 and CRA25 were highly reproducible and found suitable for use in RAPD-PCR. The genetic diversity among <i>V. harveyi</i> isolates assessed by RAPD-PCR using PM3 primer yielded 35 different RAPD patterns which clustered the isolates into 15 groups at 72% similarity level. Similarly, RAPD-PCR with CRA25 clustered the 38 patterns into 10 groups at 74% similarity. The discriminatory index $(D)$ value calculated for RAPD fingerprints generated with PM3 and CRA25 were 0.90 and 0.85, respectively. On the other hand, molecular typing of <i>V. harveyi</i> using whole cell proteins generated profiles that showed no major difference indicating the technique to be not useful in typing strains of this bacterium. However, a few of the isolates showed the presence of unique band of 28 kDa that needs to be further investigated to understand the role of the protein in disease process if any.</p>

				<title>Genetic variability and relationship between MT-1 elephant grass and closely related cultivars assessed by SRAP markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0281-0290</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic variability and relationships among elephant grass cultivars were estimated by the SRAP (sequence-related amplified polymorphism) assay. A total of 60 individuals collected from five cultivars in China were analysed. Sixty-two selected primer combinations generated 1395 bands, with an average of 22.5 per primer combination. The average value of percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 72.8% at species level. The PPB was from 15.2% to 75%, with an average of 39.6% at cultivar level. $H_{POP}$, within-cultivar Shannon‚Äôs index was 1.738 at cultivar level; at species level, the Shannon‚Äôs index $(H_{SP})$ was 3.880. An assessment of diversity between cultivars $[(H_{SP} ‚àíH_{POP})/H_{SP}]$ indicated that most of the diversity (55.2%) was detected among cultivars, and only 44.8% was within cultivars in total genetic variation. According to UPGMA dendrogram, the five cultivars were clustered into three main groups. One group included MT-1 and Mott with a bootstrap support of 100%, another consisted of Huanan and N51 with a bootstrap support of 81%, and last one was only Guimu-1. The results indicate that the MT-1 and Mott have a closest genetic relationship; Huanan and N51 possess a relatively close relationship, and Guimu-1 is the most distinct from the other four cultivars.</p>

				<title>Genotype‚Äìphenotype relationship of <i>F7</i> R353Q polymorphism and plasma factor VII coagulant activity in Asian Indian families predisposed to coronary artery disease</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0291-0297</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Elevated factor VII (FVII) level is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the role of R353Q polymorphism in the <i>F7</i> gene in 139 Indian families with CAD, comprising of 222 affected subjects, 105 unaffected subjects and 126 affected sibling pairs. Plasma per cent FVIIc activity (FVII.c activity) differed significantly across R353Q genotype ($P \lt 0.0001$). Frequency of subjects with RR and QQ genotypes were higher in 4th quartile and 1st quartile of FVII.c activity, respectively ($P \lt 0.0001$). <i>F7</i> R353Q SNP was able to explain up to 7% of variation in FVII.c activity by regression analysis and an additive genetic component of variance of 28.04% by heritability analysis. Quantitative trait loci analysis showed suggestive linkage evidence of <i>F7</i> SNP with per cent FVII.c activity (LOD score $-1.82$; $P = 0.002$). Individuals with RR and RQ genotypes carried an OR of 2.071 (95% c.i. = 1.506‚Äì2.850) and 2.472 (95% c.i. = 1.679‚Äì3.641), respectively, towards CAD risk. There was significant correlation of FVII.c activity with lipid markers, particularly among those with RR and RQ genotype after covariate adjustment. In conclusion, the <i>F7</i> R353Q SNP appears to moderately influence plasma FVII.c activity and risk of CAD in Indians.</p>

				<title>A complete mitochondrial genome of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> cv. Chinese Yumai), and fast evolving mitochondrial genes in higher plants</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0299-0307</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Plant mitochondrial genomes, encoding necessary proteins involved in the system of energy production, play an important role in the development and reproduction of the plant. They occupy a specific evolutionary pattern relative to their nuclear counterparts. Here, we determined the winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> cv. Chinese Yumai) mitochondrial genome in a length of 452 and 526 bp by shotgun sequencing its BAC library. It contains 202 genes, including 35 known protein-coding genes, three rRNA and 17 tRNA genes, as well as 149 open reading frames (ORFs; greater than 300 bp in length). The sequence is almost identical to the previously reported sequence of the spring wheat (<i>T. aestivum</i> cv. Chinese Spring); we only identified seven SNPs (three transitions and four transversions) and 10 indels (insertions and deletions) between the two independently acquired sequences, and all variations were found in non-coding regions. This result confirmed the accuracy of the previously reported mitochondrial sequence of the Chinese Spring wheat. The nucleotide frequency and codon usage of wheat are common among the lineage of higher plant with a high AT-content of 58%. Molecular evolutionary analysis demonstrated that plant mitochondrial genomes evolved at different rates, which may correlate with substantial variations in metabolic rate and generation time among plant lineages. In addition, through the estimation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates between orthologous mitochondrion-encoded genes of higher plants, we found an accelerated evolutionary rate that seems to be the result of relaxed selection.</p>

				<title>PCR-based clonality assessment in patients with lymphocytic leukaemias: a single-institution experience</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0309-0314</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>PCR-based clonality testing can be performed in all lymphoproliferations by analysing gene rearrangements of antigen receptors, rearrangements that are unique for each kind of lymphocyte. Reactive lymphoproliferations have polyclonally rearranged Ig/TCR genes, whereas malignant proliferations (leukaemias and lymphomas) show clonal rearrangements. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical benefits of clonality testing with previously evaluated consensus primers in leukaemia patients. The study included peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 67 leukaemia patients (32 B-CLL, 24 B-ALL and 11 T-ALL). Clonality testing was based on PCR amplification of rearranged I$_{\text{gH}}$ and TCR genes. During diagnosis, monoclonal pattern was found in all analysed B-CLL and T-ALL samples. Testing in B-ALL patients showed positive results in all bone marrow and one peripheral blood samples. Results of clonality testing in B-CLL patients during follow-up were concordant between peripheral blood and bone marrow. Obtained results corresponded to clinical course in all but one patient. In B-ALL group, results of molecular testing in peripheral blood and bone marrow confirmed remission estimated according to clinical criteria in all except one patient. Before any clinical sign of relapse, monoclonal pattern was found in six/seven patients by bone marrow and in three/seven patients by peripheral blood analysis, respectively. Results of molecular monitoring in T-ALL patients did not confirme clinical evaluation in two patients. Obtained results indicate high accuracy of re-evaluated primers for clonality assessment in ALL and CLL patients at the time of diagnosis. Results of clonality testing in B-ALL patients indicate that bone marrow analysis has higher sensitivity compared to analysis of peripheral blood.</p>

				<title>Population distribution of 45S and 5S rDNA in golden mahseer, <i>Tor putitora</i>: population-specific FISH marker</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0315-0320</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chromosomal locations of major 45S and minor 5S ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) and organization of 5S rRNA genes were analysed in five different populations of golden mahseers (<i>Tor putitora</i>) using fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot hybridization. All five populations of <i>T. putitora</i> ($2n = 100$) showed a similar type of macro-karyotype composed of 12 metacentric, 22 submetacentric, 14 subtelocentric and 52 telocentric chromosomes. Analysis of active nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) by silver staining did not show any differences in number and chromosomal position in different populations. But FISH data showed significant difference between the populations, four of the five populations showed six 18S (three pairs) and two 5S (one pair) signals with positional polymorphism, while one population showed eight 18S and four 5S signals, respectively. Southern blot data confirms that 5S rDNA clusters present on two different chromosome pairs in Kosi river population contain non-transcribed spacers (NTS) of same length. In the present study, simultaneous localization of 45S and 5S rDNA by in <i>situ</i> hybridization helped us to develop the discrete population-specific markers in different geographically isolated populations of <i>T. putitora.</i></p>

				<title>Mutators and hypermutability in bacteria: the <i>Escherichia coli</i> paradigm</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0379-0391</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mutators (also called hypermutators) are mutants which show higher than normal spontaneous mutation frequencies, ranging from 10‚Äì20 fold to 100‚Äì1000 fold higher, or sometimes even more, than wild-type cells. Being a mutator is advantageous to the organism when adapting to environmental changes or stressful situations, such as moving from one habitat to another, one host to another, exposure to antibiotics etc. However, this advantage is only a short-term benefit. In the long run, hypermutability leads to a fitness disadvantage due to accumulation of deleterious mutations or antagonistic pleiotropy or both. Contrary to intuitive expectations, hypermutability is commonly encountered in natural bacterial populations, especially among clinical isolates. It is believed to be involved in the emergence of antibiotic resistance and a hindrance to the treatment of infectious diseases. Here, I review the state of knowledge on the common mechanisms of hypermutability such as errors/defects in DNA replication, proof reading, mismatch repair, oxidative DNA damage, mistranslation etc., as well as phenomena associated with these processes, using Escherichia coli as a paradigmatic organism.</p>

				<title>RPGR-containing protein complexes in syndromic and non-syndromic retinal degeneration due to ciliary dysfunction</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0399-0407</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dysfunction of primary cilia due to mutations in cilia-centrosomal proteins is associated with pleiotropic disorders. The primary (or sensory) cilium of photoreceptors mediates polarized trafficking of proteins for efficient phototransduction. Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) is a cilia-centrosomal protein mutated in >70% of X-linked RP cases and 10%‚Äì20% of simplex RP males. Accumulating evidence indicates that RPGR may facilitate the orchestration of multiple ciliary protein complexes. Disruption of these complexes due to mutations in component proteins is an underlying cause of associated photoreceptor degeneration. Here, we highlight the recent developments in understanding the mechanism of cilia-dependent photoreceptor degeneration due to mutations in RPGR and RPGR-interacting proteins in severe genetic diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), Joubert syndrome, and Senior‚ÄìLoken syndrome, and explore the physiological relevance of photoreceptor ciliary protein complexes.</p>

				<title>Channelrhodopsins provide a breakthrough insight into strategies for curing blindness</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0409-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoreceptor cells are the only retinal neurons that can absorb photons. Their degeneration due to some diseases or injuries leads to blindness. Retinal prostheses electrically stimulating surviving retinal cells and evoking a pseudo light sensation have been investigated over the past decade for restoring vision. Currently, a gene therapy approach is under development. Channelrhodopsin-2 derived from the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, is a microbial-type rhodopsin. Its specific characteristic is that it functions as a light-driven cation-selective channel. It has been reported that the channelrhodopsin-2 transforms inner light-insensitive retinal neurons to light-sensitive neurons. Herein, we introduce new strategies for restoring vision by using channelrhodopsins and discuss the properties of adeno-associated virus vectors widely used in gene therapy.</p>

				<title>Induced pluripotent stem cells for retinal degenerative diseases: a new perspective on the challenges</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0417-0424</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Retinal degenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, are the prodominant causes of human blindness in the world; however, these diseases are difficult to treat. Currently, knowledge on the mechanisms of these diseases is still very limited and no radical drugs are available. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are an innovative technology that turns somatic cells into embryonic stem (ES)-like cells with pluripotent potential via the exogenous expression of several key genes. It can be used as an unlimited source for cell differentiation or tissue engineering, either of which is a promising therapy for human degenerative diseases. Induced pluripotent cells are both an unlimited source for retinal regeneration and an expectant tool for pharmaprojects and developmental or disease modelling. In this review, we try to summarize the advancement of iPS-based technologies and the potential utility for retinal degenerative diseases. We also discuss the challenges of using this technology in the retinology field.</p>

				<title>The molecular genetic basis of age-related macular degeneration: an overview</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0425-0449</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex disorder of the eye and the third leading cause of blindness worldwide. With a multifactorial etiology, AMD results in progressive loss of central vision affecting the macular region of the eye in elderly. While the prevalence is relatively higher in the Caucasian populations, it has gradually become a major public health issue among the non-Caucasian populations (including Indians) as well due to senescence, rapidly changing demographics and life-style factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on large case‚Äìcontrol cohorts have helped in mapping genes in the complement cascade that are involved in the regulation of innate immunity with AMD susceptibility. Genes involved with mitochondrial oxidative stress and extracellular matrix regulation also play a role in AMD pathogenesis. Majority of the associations observed in complement (<i>CFH, CFB, C2</i> and <i>C3</i>) and other (<i>ARMS2</i> and <i>HTRA1</i>) genes have been replicated in diverse populations worldwide. Gene‚Äìgene (<i>CFH</i> with <i>ARMS2</i> and <i>HTRA1</i>) interactions and correlations with environmental traits (smoking and body mass index) have been established as significant covariates in AMD pathology. In this review, we have provided an overview on the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms in AMD worldwide and highlight the AMD-associated-candidate genes and their potential role in disease pathogenesis.</p>

				<title>Molecular complexity of primary open angle glaucoma: current concepts</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0451-0467</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glaucoma is a group of heterogeneous optic neuropathies with complex genetic basis. Among the three principle subtypes of glaucoma, primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) occurs most frequently. Till date, 25 loci have been found to be linked to POAG. However, only three underlying genes (<i>Myocilin, Optineurin</i> and <i>WDR36</i>) have been identified. In addition, at least 30 other genes have been reported to be associated with POAG. Despite strong genetic influence in POAG pathogenesis, only a small part of the disease can be explained in terms of genetic aberration. Current concepts of glaucoma pathogenesis suggest it to be a neurodegenerative disorder which is triggered by different factors including mechanical stress due to intra-ocular pressure, reduced blood flow to retina, reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and aberrant immune response. Here we present a mechanistic overview of potential pathways and crosstalk between them operating in POAG pathogenesis.</p>

				<title>Mouse models of cataract</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0469-0486</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Much of our knowledge about the function of genes in cataracts has been derived from the molecular analysis of spontaneous or induced mutations in the mouse. Mutations affecting the mouse lens can be identified easily by visual inspection, and a remarkable number of mutant lines have been characterized. In contrast to humans, most of the genetic mouse cataract models suffer from congenital cataracts, and only a few develop cataracts in old age. Therefore, the mouse cataract models contributed rather to the understanding of lens development than to the ageing process taking place in the lens. A prerequisite formolecular analysis is the chromosomal localization of the gene. In this review, several mouse models will be discussed with emphasis on the underlying genetic basis rather than the morphological features as exemplified by the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the most frequent mutations in congenital cataracts affect genes coding for ùõæ-crystallins (gene symbol: <i>Cryg</i>);</li>
						<li>some postnatal, progressive cataracts have been characterized by mutations in the ùõΩ-crystallin encoding genes (<i>Cryb</i>);</li>
						<li>mutations in genes coding for membrane proteins like MIP or connexins lead to congenital cataracts;</li>
						<li>mutations in genes coding for transcription factors such as <i>FoxE3, Maf, Sox1</i>, and <i>Six5</i> cause cataracts;</li>
						<li>mouse models suffering from hereditary age-related cataracts (e.g. Emory cataract) have not yet been characterized genetically.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>In conclusion, a broad variety of hereditary congenital cataracts are well understood at the molecular level. Further, expression patterns of the affected genes in several other tissues and organs outside the eye, is making it increasingly clear that isolated cataracts are the exception rather than the rule. By further understanding the pleiotropic effects of these genes, we might recognize cataracts as an easily visible biomarker for a number of systemic syndromes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The corneal endothelium maintains the level of hydration in the cornea. Dysfunction of the endothelium results in excess accumulation of water in the corneal stroma, leading to swelling of the stroma and loss of transparency. There are four different corneal endothelial dystrophies that are hereditary, progressive, non-inflammatory disorders involving dysfunction of the corneal endothelium. Each of the endothelial dystrophies is genetically heterogeneous with different modes of transmission and/or different genes involved in each subtype. Genes responsible for disease have been identified for only a subset of corneal endothelial dystrophies. Knowledge of genes involved and their function in the corneal endothelium can aid understanding the pathogenesis of the disorder as well as reveal pathways that are important for normal functioning of the endothelium.</p>

				<title>A comprehensive, sensitive and economical approach for the detection of mutations in the <i>RB1</i> gene in retinoblastoma</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0517-0527</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. It is brought about by the mutational inactivation of both alleles of <i>RB1</i> gene in the developing retina. To identify the <i>RB1</i> mutations, we analysed 74 retinoblastoma patients by screening the exons and the promoter region of <i>RB1</i>. The strategy used was to detect large deletions/duplications by fluorescent quantitative multiplex PCR; small deletions/insertions by fluorescent genotyping of <i>RB1</i> alleles, and point mutations by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Genomic DNA from the peripheral blood leucocytes of 74 Rb patients (53 with bilateral Rb, 21 with unilateral Rb; 4 familial cases) was screened for mutations. Recurrent mutations were identified in five patients with bilateral Rb, large deletions in 11 patients (nine with bilateral Rb and two with unilateral Rb), small deletions/insertions were found in 12 patients all with bilateral Rb, and point mutations in 26 patients (14 nonsense, six splice site, five substitution and one silent change). Three mutations were associated with variable expressivity of the disease in different family members. Using this method, the detection rates achieved in patients with bilateral Rb were 44/53 (83%) and with unilateral Rb, 5/21 (23.8%). This approach may be feasible for clinical genetic testing and counselling of patients.</p>

				<title>Detecting relationships between amylose content and amino acid contents of <i>indica</i> rice with conditional approach</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0001-0008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The relationship between the genetic effects of endosperm, cytoplasm and maternal plant on amylose content (AC) and amino acid contents of <i>indica</i> rice was studied using unconditional and conditional analysis methods. The results indicated that the protein content (PC) and brown rice weight (WBR) could significantly affect the relationships between AC and amino acid contents of rice. The phenotypic and genotypic covariances between AC and amino acid contents were most significantly negative under the interference of PC or WBR, but most of the relationships for the paired traits were not significant after excluding the influence of PC or WBR on AC. For the conditional genetic relationship analysis of different genetic systems including endosperm, cytoplasm and maternal plant, visible changes were found in many genetic correlation components between AC and amino acid content after eliminating the influences of PC, especially, for the endosperm or maternal additive effects, endosperm additive or dominance interaction effects and maternal additive interaction effects. The relationships of the paired traits conditioned on WBR were mainly controlled by the endosperm dominance or additive interaction effects.</p>

				<title>AFLP studies on downy-mildew-resistant and downy-mildew-susceptible genotypes of opium poppy</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0009-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Downy mildew (DM) caused by <i>Peronospora arborescens</i>, is a serious disease in opium poppy (<i>Papaver somniferum</i>), which has a world-wide spread. The establishment of DM-resistant cultivars appears to be a sustainable way to control the disease. In this paper, we present the results of a study aimed at the identification of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers for DM-resistance in opium poppy. Three opium poppy genotypes (inbred over about 10 years): Pps-1 (DM-resistant), Jawahar-16 (DM-susceptible) and H-9 (DM-susceptible) were crossed in a diallel manner and the F1 progeny along with the parents were subjected to AFLP analysis of chloroplast (cp) and nuclear DNA with seven and nine <i>EcoRI / MseI</i> primer combinations, respectively. cpDNA AFLP analysis identified 24 Pps-1 (DM-resistant)-specific unique fragments that were found to be maternally inherited in both the crosses, Pps-1 &#215; Jawahar-16 and Pps-1 &#215; H-9. In the case of nuclear DNA AFLP analysis, it was found that 17 fragments inherited from Pps-1 were common to the reciprocal crosses of both</p>

These AFLP markers could be used in future genetic studies for analysis of linkage to the downy mildew resistance trait.</p>

				<title>Quantitative trait loci for tibial bone strength in C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ inbred strains of mice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0021-0027</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Three-point bending technology has been widely used in the measurement of bone strength. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for bone strength have been identified using mouse femurs. In this study, we investigate the use of mouse tibiae in identification of QTLs that regulate bone strength. Mouse tibiae were from a F<sub>2</sub> population derived from C57BL/6J (B6) and C3H/HeJ (C3H). Three-point bending was measured using ISO 4049, with the support width adjustable to accommodate specimen sizes outside the scope of ISO 4049. The strain rate is selectable from 0.05 to 500 mm per min. All stress strain diagrams are recorded and retrieved in digital electronic form. Genome scan was performed in The Jackson Laboratory (TJL). QTL mapping was conducted using Map Manager QTX software. Data show that</p>
					<ol>
						<li>both elastic modulus (stiffness) and maximum loading (strength) value appear as normal distributions, suggesting that multiple genetic factors control the bone strength;</li>
						<li>11 QTLs, accounting for 90% of variation for strength, have been detected. More than half QTLs of three-point bending are located on the same locations of bone density earlier identified from mouse femurs;</li>
						<li>a major QTL of femoral and vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) was not detected for bone strength of tibiae;</li>
						<li>the QTL on chromosome 4 has extremely high LOD score of 31.8 and represents 60% of the variation of bone strength; and</li>
						<li>four QTLs of stiffness (chromosomes 2, 11, 15 and 19) have been identified.</li>

				<title>Diversity of five novel Y-STR loci and their application in studies of north Chinese populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0029-0036</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) show sufficient variability among individuals in a population and high degree of geographical differentiation, so their polymorphic character makes them especially suited for population genetic studies. In this study, five novel Y-STR loci were analysed in 174 samples from five minority populations residing in north China (Daur, Kazak, Xibe, Uighur and Kirgiz) to determine the diversity of these loci in north China and to evaluate their usefulness in population study. Ninety-seven haplotypes were constructed, with 30 in Daur, 24 in Kazak, 28 in Uighur, 27 in Xibe and 16 in Kirgiz. Sixty-six (68.04%) of them were unique. The $R_{\text{ST}}$ showed that there was no significant difference in Daur and Xibe ($R_{\text{ST}} = 0.02231$, $P \gt 0.05$), while among the Kazak, Uighur and Kirgiz, who reside in northwest China, there were significant differences. These results showed that these five Y-STR loci were polymorphic in the five populations. The results of AMOVA showed that majority of the differences were found within populations. By $R_{\text{ST}}$, the relationships of the five populations were accordance with the historical records: Xibe migrated to Xinjiang during the Qing Dynasty, and Kazak, Uighur and Kirgiz have different ancestors.</p>

				<title>Lamin C and chromatin organization in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0037-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Drosophila</i> lamin C (LamC) is a developmentally regulated component of the nuclear lamina. The <i>lamC</i> gene is situated in the fifth intron of the essential gene <i>tout velu</i> (<i>ttv</i>). We carried out genetic analysis of lamC during development. Phenotypic analyses of RNAi-mediated downregulation of <i>lamC</i> expression as well as targeted misexpression of lamin C suggest a role for <i>lamC</i> in cell survival. Of particular interest in the context of laminopathies is the caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by the overexpression of lamin C. Interestingly, misexpression of lamin C in the central nervous system, where it is not normally expressed, did not affect organization of the nuclear lamina. <i>lamC</i> mutant alleles suppressed position effect variegation normally displayed at near-centromeric and telomeric regions. Further, both downregulation and misexpression of lamin C affected the distribution of heterochromatin protein 1. Our results suggest that <i>Drosophila lamC</i> has a tissue-specific role during development and is required for chromatin organization.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The phylogenetic relationships among flesh flies of the family Sarcophagidae has been based mainly on the morphology of male genitalia. However, the male genitalic character-based relationships are far from satisfactory. Therefore, in the present study mitochondrial DNA has been used as marker to unravel genetic relatedness and to construct phylogeny among five sympatric species of the genus <i>Sarcophaga</i>. Two mitochondrial genes viz., cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and NAD dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) were sequenced and genetic distance values were calculated on the basis of sequence differences in both the mitochondrial genes. The data revealed very few genetic difference among the five species for the COI and ND5 gene sequences.</p>

				<title>Evaluating variations of genotype calling: a potential source of spurious associations in genome-wide association studies</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0055-0064</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) examine the entire human genome with the goal of identifying genetic variants (usually single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) that are associated with phenotypic traits such as disease status and drug response. The discordance of significantly associated SNPs for the same disease identified from different GWAS indicates that false associations exist in such results. In addition to the possible sources of spurious associations that have been investigated and discussed intensively, such as sample size and population stratification, an accurate and reproducible genotype calling algorithm is required for concordant GWAS results from different studies. However, variations of genotype calling of an algorithm and their effects on significantly associated SNPs identified in downstream association analyses have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, the variations of genotype calling using the Bayesian Robust Linear Model with Mahalanobis distance classifier (BRLMM) algorithm and the resulting influence on the lists of significantly associated SNPs were evaluated using the raw data of 270 HapMap samples analysed with the Affymetrix Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affy500K) by changing algorithmic parameters. Modified were the Dynamic Model (DM) call confidence threshold (threshold) and the number of randomly selected SNPs (size). Comparative analysis of the calling results and the corresponding lists of significantly associated SNPs identified through association analysis revealed that algorithmic parameters used in BRLMM affected the genotype calls and the significantly associated SNPs. Both the threshold and the size affected the called genotypes and the lists of significantly associated SNPs in association analysis. The effect of the threshold was much larger than the effect of the size. Moreover, the heterozygous calls had lower consistency compared to the homozygous calls.</p>

				<title>Genetic diversity and population structure of 10 Chinese indigenous egg-type duck breeds assessed by microsatellite polymorphism</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0065-0072</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The genetic structure and diversity of 10 Chinese indigenous egg-type duck breeds were investigated using 29 microsatellite markers. The total number of animals examined were 569, on average 57 animals per breed were selected. The microsatellite marker set analysed provided 177 alleles (mean 6.1 alleles per locus, ranging from 3 to 10). All populations showed high levels of heterozygosity with the lowest estimate of 0.539 for the Jinding ducks, and the highest 0.609 observed for Jingjiang partridge ducks. The global heterozygote deficit across all populations ($F_{\text{IT}}$) amounted to $-0.363$. About 10% of the total genetic variability originated from differences among breeds, with all loci contributing significantly. An unrooted consensus tree was constructed using the NeighborNet tree based on the Reynold‚Äôs genetic distance. The structure software was used to assess genetic clustering of these egg-type duck breeds. Clustering analysis provided an accurate representation of the current genetic relations among the breeds. An integrated analysis was undertaken to obtain information on the population dynamics in Chinese indigenous egg-type duck breeds, and to better determine the conservation priorities.</p>

				<title>Reverse engineering large-scale genetic networks: synthetic versus real data</title>
				<feature>Researcj Article</feature>
				<page>0073-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Development of microarray technology has resulted in an exponential rise in gene expression data. Linear computational methods are of great assistance in identifying molecular interactions, and elucidating the functional properties of gene networks. It overcomes the weaknesses of in vivo experiments including high cost, large noise, and unrepeatable process. In this paper, we propose an easily applied system, Stepwise Network Inference (SWNI), which integrates deterministic linear model with statistical analysis, and has been tested effectively on both simulated experiments and real gene expression data sets. The study illustrates that connections of gene networks can be significantly detected via SWNI with high confidence, when single gene perturbation experiments are performed complying with the algorithm requirements. In particular, our algorithm shows efficiency and outperforms the existing ones presented in this paper when dealing with large-scale sparse networks without any prior knowledge.</p>

				<title>Physicochemical evolution and positive selection of the gymnosperm matK proteins</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0081-0089</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is not clear whether matK evolves under Darwinian selection. In this study, the gymnosperm Taxaceae, Cephalotaxaceae and Pinaceae were used to illustrate the physicochemical evolution, molecular adaptation and evolutionary dynamics of gene divergence in matKs. <i>matK</i> sequences were amplified from 27 Taxaceae and 12 Cephalotaxaceae species. <i>matK</i> sequences of 19 Pinaceae species were retrieved from GenBank. The phylogenetic tree was generated using conceptual-translated amino acid sequences. Selective influences were investigated using standard $d_{\text{N}}/d_{\text{S}}$ ratio methods and more sensitive techniques investigating the amino acid property changes resulting from nonsynonymous replacements in a phylogenetic context. Analyses revealed the presence of positive selection in matKs (N-terminal region, RT domain and domain X) of Taxaceae and Pinaceae, and found positive destabilizing selection in N-terminal region and RT domain of Cephalotaxaceae matK. Moreover, various amino acid properties were found to be influenced by destabilizing positive selection. Amino acid sites relating to these properties and to different secondary structures were found and have the potential to affect group II intron maturase function. Despite the evolutionary constraint on the rapidly evolving matK, this protein evolves under positive selection in gymnosperm. Several regions of matK have experienced molecular adaptation which fine-tunes maturase performance.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>HIV-1 infection has rapidly spread worldwide and has become the leading cause of mortality in infectious diseases. The duration for development of AIDS (AIDS progression) is highly variable among HIV‚Äì1 infected individuals, ranging from 2‚Äì3 years to no signs of AIDS development in the entire lifetime. Several factors regulate the rate at which HIV-1 infection progresses to AIDS. Host genetic factors play an important role in the outcome of such complex or multifactor diseases as AIDS and are also known to regulate the rate of disease progression. This review focuses on the major host genes reported to affect the progression to AIDS in HIV-1 infected individuals.</p>

				<title>Comparative evaluation of genetic diversity using RAPD, SSR and cytochrome P450 gene based markers with respect to calcium content in finger millet (<i>Eleusine coracana</i> L. Gaertn.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0121-0133</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic relationships among 52 <i>Eleusine coracana</i> (finger millet) genotypes collected from different districts of Uttarakhand were investigated by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), simple sequence repeat (SSR) and cytochrome P450 gene based markers. A total of 18 RAPD primers, 10 SSR primers, and 10 pairs of cytochrome P450 gene based markers, respectively, revealed 49.4%, 50.2% and 58.7% polymorphism in 52 genotypes of <i>E. coracana</i>. Mean polymorphic information content (PIC) for each of these marker systems (0.351 for RAPD, 0.505 for SSR and 0.406 for cyt P450 gene based markers) suggested that all the marker systems were effective in determining polymorphisms. Pair-wise similarity index values ranged from 0.011 to 0.999 (RAPD), 0.010 to 0.999 (SSR) and 0.001 to 0.998 (cyt P450 gene based markers) and mean similarity index value of 0.505, 0.504 and 0.499, respectively. The dendrogram developed by RAPD, SSR and cytochrome P450 gene based primers analyses revealed that the genotypes are grouped in different clusters according to high calcium (300‚Äì450 mg/100 g), medium calcium (200‚Äì300 mg/100 g) and low calcium (100‚Äì200 mg/100 g). Mantel test employed for detection of goodness of fit established cophenetic correlation values above 0.95 for all the three marker systems. The dendrograms and principal coordinate analysis (PCA) plots derived from the binary data matrices of the three marker systems are highly concordant. High bootstrap values were obtained at major nodes of phenograms through WINBOOT software. Comparison of RAPD, SSR and cytochrome P450 gene based markers, in terms of the quality of data output, indicated that SSRs and cyt P450 gene based markers are particularly promising for the analysis of plant genome diversity. The genotypes of finger millet collected from different districts of Uttarakhand constitute a wide genetic base and clustered according to calcium contents. The identified genotypes could be used in breeding programmes and amajor input into conservation biology of cereal crops.</p>

				<title>SSR mining in oil palm EST database: application in oil palm germplasm diversity studies</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0135-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study reports on the detection of additional expressed sequence tags (EST) derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for the oil palm. A large collection of 19243 <i>Elaeis guineensis</i> ESTs were assembled to give 10258 unique sequences, of which 629 ESTs were found to contain 722 SSRs with a variety of motifs. Dinucleotide repeats formed the largest group (45.6%) consisting of 66.9% AG/CT, 21.9% AT/AT, 10.9% AC/GT and 0.3% CG/CG motifs. This was followed by trinucleotide repeats, which is the second most abundant repeat types (34.5%) consisting of AAG/CTT (23.3%), AGG/CCT (13.7%), CCG/CGG (11.2%), AAT/ATT (10.8%), AGC/GCT (10.0%), ACT/AGT (8.8%), ACG/CGT (7.6%), ACC/GGT (7.2%), AAC/GTT (3.6%) and AGT/ACT (3.6%) motifs. Primer pairs were designed for 405 unique EST-SSRs and 15 of these were used to genotype 105 <i>E. guineensis</i> and 30 <i>E. oleifera</i> accessions. Fourteen SSRs were polymorphic in at least one germplasm revealing a total of 101 alleles. The high percentage (78.0%) of alleles found to be specific for either <i>E. guineensis</i> or <i>E. oleifera</i> has increased the power for discriminating the two species. The estimates of genetic differentiation detected by EST-SSRs were compared to those reported previously. The transferability across palm taxa to two <i>Cocos nucifera</i> and six exotic palms is also presented. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of three primer-pairs detected in <i>E. guineensis</i>, <i>E. oleifera, C. nucifera</i> and <i>Jessinia bataua</i> were cloned and sequenced. Sequence alignments showed mutations within the SSR site and the flanking regions. Phenetic analysis based on the sequence data revealed that <i>C. nucifera</i> is closer to oil palm compared to <i>J. bataua</i>; consistent with the taxanomic classification.</p>

				<page>0147-0154</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A spontaneous mutation in BALB/c mice that causes congenital dense cataract and microphthalmia (<i>dcm</i>) was reported previously. This abnormality was found to be inheritable and the mode of inheritance indicated that this phenotype is due to mutation of an autosomal recessive gene. We performed genetic screen to identify the underlying mutations through linkage analysis with the <i>dcm</i> progenies of F<sub>1</sub> intercross. We identified the region of mutation on chromosome 3 and further mapping and sequence analysis identified the mutation in the <i>GJA8</i> gene that encodes for connexin 50. The mutation represents a single nucleotide change at position 64 (G to C) that results in a change in the amino acid glycine to arginine at position 22 (G22R) and is identical to the mutation previously characterized as <i>lop10</i>. However, the phenotype of these mice differ from that of <i>lop10</i> mice and since it is one of the very few genetic models with recessive pattern of inheritance, we propose that <i>dcm</i> mice can serve as a useful model for studying the dynamics and interaction of the gap junction formation in mouse eye development.</p>

				<title>Association of AFLP and SSR markers with agronomic and fibre quality traits in <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0155-0162</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular markers linked to QTL contributing to agronomic and fibre quality traits would be useful for cotton improvement. We have attempted to tag yield and fibre quality traits with AFLP and SSR markers using F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> populations of a cross between two <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> varieties, PS56-4 and RS2013. Out of 50 AFLP primer combinations and 177 SSR primer pairs tested, 32 AFLP and four SSR primers were chosen for genotyping F<sub>2</sub> individuals.Marker-trait associations were studied for eight agronomic and five fibre quality traits through simple and multiple regression analysis (MRA) using a set of 92 AFLP polymorphic loci and four SSR markers. Simple linear regression analysis (SLRA) identified 23 markers for eight different traits whereas multiple regression analysis identified 30 markers for at least one of the 13 traits. SSR marker BNL 3502 was consistently identified to be associated with fibre strength. While all the markers identified in SLRA were also detected in MRA, as many as 16 of the 30 markers were identified to be associated with respective traits in both F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> generations. The markers explained up to 41 per cent of phenotypic variation for individual traits. A number of markers were found to be associated with multiple traits suggesting clustering of QTLs for fibre quality traits in cotton.</p>

				<title>Chromosomal localization of rDNA genes and genomic organization of 5S rDNA in <i>Oreochromis mossambicus, O. urolepis hornorum</i> and their hybrid</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0163-0171</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, classical and molecular cytogenetic analyses were performed in tilapia fishes, <i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i> (XX/XY sex determination system), <i>O. urolepis hornorum</i> (WZ/ZZ sex determination system) and their hybrid by crossing <i>O. mossambicus</i> female &#215; <i>O. u. hornorum</i> male. An identical karyotype (($2n = 44$, NF (total number of chromosomal arms) = 50) was obtained from three examined tilapia samples. Genomic organization analysis of 5S rDNA revealed two different types of 5S rDNA sequences, 5S type I and 5S type II. Moreover, fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) with 5S rDNA probes showed six positive fluorescence signals on six chromosomes of all the analysed metaphases from the three tilapia samples. Subsequently, 45S rDNA probes were also prepared, and six positive fluorescence signals were observed on three chromosome pairs in all analysed metaphases of the three tilapia samples. The correlation between 45 rDNA localization and nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) was confirmed by silver nitrate staining in tilapia fishes. Further, different chromosomal localizations of 5S rDNA and 45S rDNA were verified by two different colour FISH probes. Briefly, the current data provide an insights for hybridization projects and breeding improvement of tilapias.</p>

				<title>Karyotype instability in the ponerine ant genus <i>Diacamma</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0173-0182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The queenless ponerine ant <i>Diacamma ceylonense</i> and a population of <i>Diacamma</i> from the Nilgiri hills which we refer to as ‚Äò<i>nilgiri</i>‚Äô, exhibit interesting similarities as well as dissimilarities. Molecular phylogenetic study of these morphologically almost similar taxa has shown that <i>D. ceylonense</i> is closely related to ‚Äò<i>nilgiri</i>‚Äô and indicates that ‚Äò<i>nilgiri</i>‚Äô is a recent diversion in the <i>Diacamma</i> phylogenetic tree. However, there is a striking behavioural difference in the way reproductive monopoly is maintained by the respective gamergates (mated egg laying workers), and there is evidence that they are genetically differentiated, suggesting a lack of gene flow. To develop a better understanding of the mechanism involved in speciation of <i>Diacamma</i>, we have analysed karyotypes of <i>D. ceylonense</i> and ‚Äò<i>nilgiri</i>‚Äô. In both, we found surprising inter-individual and intra-individual karyotypic mosaicism. The observed numerical variability, both at intra-individual and inter-individual levels, does not appear to have hampered the sustainability of the chromosomal diversity in each population under study. Since the related <i>D. indicum</i> displays no such intra-individual or inter-individual variability whatsoever under identical experimental conditions, these results are unlikely to be artifacts. Although no known mechanisms can account for the observed karyotypic variability of this nature, we believe that the present findings on the ants under study would provide opportunities for exciting new discoveries concerning the origin, maintenance and significance of intra-individual and inter-individual karyotypic mosaicism.</p>

				<title>cDNA cloning and expression analysis of two distinct <i>Sox8</i> genes in <i>Paramisgurnus dabryanus</i> (Cypriniformes)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0183-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>Sox9</i> gene attracts a lot of attention because of its connection with gonadal development and differentiation. However, <i>Sox8</i>, belonging to the same subgroup <i>SoxE</i>, has rarely been studied. To investigate the function as well as the evolutionary origin of <i>SOXE</i> subgroup, we amplified the genomic DNA of <i>Paramisgurnus dabryanu</i> using a pair of degenerate primers. Using rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE), it was discovered that <i>P. dabryanu</i> has two duplicates: <i>Sox8a</i> and <i>Sox8b</i>. Each has an intron of different length in the conserved HMG-box region. The overall sequence similarity of the deduced amino acid of <i>PdSox8a</i> and <i>PdSox8b</i> was 46.26%, and only two amino acids changed in the HMG-box. This is the first evidence showing that there are two distinct duplications of <i>Sox8</i> genes in Cypriniformes. Southern blot analysis showed only one hybrid band, with lengths 7.4 or 9.2 kb. Both semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR assay displayed that both <i>PdSox8a</i> and <i>PdSox8b</i> are downregulated during early embryonic development. In adult tissues, the two <i>Sox8</i> genes expressed ubiquitously, and expression levels are particularly high in the gonads and brain. In gonads, both <i>PdSox8a</i> and <i>PdSox8b</i> are expressed at a higher level in the tesis than in the ovary. <i>PdSox8a</i> and <i>PdSox8b</i> may have functional overlaps and are essential for the neuronal development and differentiation of gonads.</p>

				<title>Allelic variations in <i>Glu-1</i> and <i>Glu-3</i> loci of historical and modern Iranian bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) cultivars</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0193-0199</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Proline and glutamine-rich wheat seed endosperm proteins are collectively referred to as prolamins. They are comprised of HMW-GSs, LMW-GSs and gliadins. HMW-GSs are major determinants of gluten elasticity and LMW-GSs considerably affect dough extensibility and maximum dough resistance. The inheritance of glutenin subunits follows Mendelian genetics with multiple alleles in each locus. Identification of the banding patterns of glutenin subunits could be used as an estimate for screening high quality wheat germplasm. Here, by means of a two-step 1D-SDS-PAGE procedure, we identified the allelic variations in high and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits in 65 hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) cultivars representing a historical trend in the cultivars introduced or released in Iran from the years 1940 to 1990. Distinct alleles 17 and 19 were detected for <i>Glu-1</i> and <i>Glu-3</i> loci, respectively. The allelic frequencies at the <i>Glu-1</i> loci demonstrated unimodal distributions. At <i>Glu-A1, Glu-B1</i> and <i>Glu-D1</i>, we found that the most frequent alleles were the null, 7 + 8, 2 + 12 alleles, respectively, in Iranian wheat cultivars. In contrast, <i>Glu-3</i> loci showed bimodal or trimodal distributions. At <i>Glu-A3</i>, the most frequent alleles were c and e. At <i>Glu-B3</i> the most frequent alleles were a, b and c. At <i>Glu-D3</i> locus, the alleles b and a, were the most and the second most frequent alleles in Iranian wheat cultivars. This led to a significantly higher Nei coefficient of genetic variations in <i>Glu-3</i> loci (0.756) as compared to <i>Glu-1</i> loci (0.547). At <i>Glu-3</i> loci, we observed relatively high quality alleles in <i>Glu-A3</i> and <i>Glu-D3</i> loci and low quality alleles at <i>Glu-B3</i> locus.</p>

				<title>Genetic control of leaf-blade morphogenesis by the <i>INSECATUS</i> gene in <i>Pisum sativum</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0201-0211</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To understand the role of <i>INSECATUS</i> (<i>INS</i>) gene in pea, the leaf blades of wild-type, <i>ins</i> mutant and seven other genotypes, constructed by recombining <i>ins</i> with <i>uni-tac, af, tl</i> and <i>mfp</i> gene mutations, were quantitatively compared. The <i>ins</i> was inherited as a recessive mutant allele and expressed its phenotype in proximal leaflets of full size leaf blades. In <i>ins</i> leaflets, the midvein development was arrested in distal domain and a cleft was formed in lamina above this point. There was change in the identity of <i>ins</i> leaflets such that the intercalary interrupted midvein bore a leaf blade. Such adventitious blades in <i>ins, ins tl</i> and ins <i>tl mfp</i> were like the distal segment of respective main leaf blade. The ins phenotype was not seen in <i>ins af</i> and <i>ins af uni-tac</i> genotypes. There was epistasis of <i>uni-tac</i> over <i>ins</i>. The <i>ins, tl</i> and <i>mfp</i> mutations interacted synergistically to produce highly pronounced ins phenotype in the <i>ins tl mfp</i> triple mutant. The role(s) of <i>INS</i> in leaf-blade organogenesis are: positive regulation of vascular patterning in leaflets, repression of UNI activity in leaflet primordia for ectopic growth and in leaf-blade primordium for indeterminate growth of rachis, delimitation of proximal leaflet domain and together with TL and MFP homeostasis for meristematic activity in leaflet primordia. The variant apically bifid shape of the affected <i>ins</i> leaflets demonstrated that the leaflet shape is dependent on the venation pattern.</p>

				<title>The role of the <i>Drosophila</i> LAMMER protein kinase DOA in somatic sex determination</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0271-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DOA kinase, the <i>Drosophila</i> member of the LAMMER/Clk protein kinase family, phosphorylates SR and SR-like proteins, including TRA, TRA2 and RBP1, which are responsible for the alternative splicing of transcripts encoding the key regulator of sex-specific expression in somatic cells of the fly, DOUBLESEX. Specific <i>Doa</i> alleles induce somatic female-to-male sex transformations, which can be enhanced when combined with mutations in loci encoding SR and SR-like proteins. The <i>Doa</i> locus encodes six different kinases, of which a 69-kDa isoform is expressed solely in females. Expression of this isoform is itself under the regulation of the somatic sex determination regulatory network, thus forming a putative positive autoregulatory loop which would reinforce the choice of the female cell-fate. We speculate that this loop is part of the evolutionary ancestral sex-determination machinery, based upon evidence demonstrating the existence of an autoregulatory loop involving TRA and TRA2 in several other insect species.</p>

				<title>Conservation and sex-specific splicing of the <i>doublesex</i> gene in the economically important pest species <i>Lucilia cuprina</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0279-0285</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic control of sex determination in insects has been best characterized in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, where the master gene <i>Sxl</i> codes for RNA that is sex specifically spliced to produce a functional protein only in females. SXL regulates the sex-specific splicing of <i>transformer</i> (<i>tra</i>) RNA which, in turn, regulates the splicing of <i>dsx</i> RNA to produce functional male and female proteins. In the Australian sheep blowfly (<i>Lucilia cuprina</i>), the <i>tra</i> gene (<i>Lctra</i>) is required for female development and <i>Lctra</i> transcripts are sex-specifically spliced such that only female <i>Lctra</i> mRNA codes for functional protein. In males, a factor encoded by the Y-linked male determining gene is thought to prevent the female-mode of splicing of <i>Lctra</i> RNA. To further our understanding of the sex determination regulatory hierarchy in <i>L. cuprina</i>, we have isolated the <i>dsx</i> gene (<i>Lcdsx</i>) from this species. We found that the <i>Lcdsx</i> transcripts are sex-specifically spliced in a similar manner as their counterparts in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, housefly and tephritids. The LcDSX proteins are well conserved and the male form of DSX contains a motif encoded by a male-specific exon that is within the female-specific intron. This intron/exon arrangement had previously been found only in the housefly <i>dsx</i> gene, suggesting this may be a unique feature of <i>dsx</i> genes of Calyptratae species.</p>

				<title><i>fruitless</i> alternative splicing and sex behaviour in insects: an ancient and unforgettable love story?</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0287-0299</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Courtship behaviours are common features of animal species that reproduce sexually. Typically, males are involved in courting females. Insects display an astonishing variety of courtship strategies primarily based on innate stereotyped responses to various external stimuli. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, male courtship requires proteins encoded by the <i>fruitless</i> (<i>fru</i>) gene that are produced in different sex-specific isoforms via alternative splicing. <i>Drosophila</i> mutant flies with loss-of-function alleles of the <i>fru</i> gene exhibit blocked male courtship behaviour. However, various individual steps in the courtship ritual are disrupted in fly strains carrying different <i>fru</i> alleles. These findings suggest that <i>fru</i> is required for specific steps in courtship. In distantly related insect species, various <i>fru</i> paralogues were isolated, which shows conservation of sex-specific alternative splicing and protein expression in neural tissues and suggests an evolutionary functional conservation of <i>fru</i> in the control of male-specificcourtship behaviour. In this review, we report the seminal findings regarding the <i>fru</i> gene, its splicing regulation and evolution in insects.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The sexual development of an insect is defined through a hierarchical control of several sex determining genes. Of these genes, <i>transformer</i> (<i>tra</i>) and <i>doublesex</i> (<i>dsx</i>) are well characterized and functionally conserved, especially <i>dsx.</i> Both genes are regulated at the transcriptional level through sex-specific alternative splicing. Incorporation of a genetically engineered sex-specific splicing module derived from these genes in transgenic systems, such as RIDL (release of insects carrying a dominant lethal), would allow the production of male-only insects for control programmes without any physical intervention.</p>

				<title>New Y chromosomes and early stages of sex chromosome differentiation: sex determination in <i>Megaselia</i></title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0307-0313</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The phorid fly <i>Megaselia scalaris</i> is a laboratory model for the turnover and early differentiation of sex chromosomes. Isolates from the field have an XY sex-determining mechanism with chromosome pair 2 acting as X and Y chromosomes. The sex chromosomes are homomorphic but display early signs of sex chromosome differentiation: a low level of molecular differences between X and Y. The male-determining function $(M)$, maps to the distal part of the Y chromosome‚Äôs short arm. In laboratory cultures, new Y chromosomes with no signs of a molecular differentiation arise at a low rate, probably by transposition of ùëÄ to these chromosomes. Downstream of the primary signal, the homologue of the <i>Drosophila doublesex</i> (<i>dsx</i>) is part of the sex-determining pathway while <i>Sex-lethal</i> (<i>Sxl</i>), though structurally conserved, is not.</p>

				<title><i>Sciara</i> as an experimental model for studies on the evolutionary relationships between the zygotic, maternal and environmental primary signals for sexual development</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0325-0331</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sex determination refers to the developmental programme that commits the embryo to either the male or the female pathway. There are a plethora of mechanisms via which gender is decided. These mechanisms can be classified into three main categories depending on the origin of the primary, genetic, sex-determination signal, which can be zygotic, maternal or environmental. In the dipteran <i>Sciara</i>, the zygotic signal is a consequence of the maternal signal, and this in turn can be a consequence of the environmental signal. This makes <i>Sciara</i> a unique experimental model for studying the evolutionary relationships between the three primary signals triggering sexual development.</p>

				<title>Genetics of sex determination in the haplodiploid wasp <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i> (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea)</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0333-0339</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The parasitoid wasp <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i> reproduces by haplodiploidy; males are haploid and females are diploid. Sex determination in <i>Nasonia</i> is not governed by complementary alleles at one or more sex loci. As in most other insects, the sex-determining pathway consists of the basal switch <i>doublesex</i> that is sex-specifically regulated by <i>transformer.</i> Analysis of a polyploid and a mutant gynandromorphic strain, suggested a parent-specific effect (imprinting) on sex determination in <i>Nasonia</i>. Zygotic activity of <i>transformer</i> is autoregulated and depends on a combination of maternal provision of <i>tra</i> mRNA and a paternal genome set. This constitutes a novel way of <i>transformer</i> control in insect sex determination implying maternal imprinting. The nature of the maternal imprint is not yet known and it remains to be determined how broadly the <i>Nasonia</i> sex-determining mechanism applies to other haplodiploids.</p>

				<title><i>Doublesex</i>: a conserved downstream gene controlled by diverse upstream regulators</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0341-0356</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sex determination, an integral precursor to sexual reproduction, is required to generate morphologically distinct sexes. The molecular components of sex-determination pathways regulating sexual differentiation have been identified and characterized in different organisms. The <i>Drosophila doublesex</i> (<i>dsx</i>) gene at the bottom of the sex-determination cascade is the best characterized candidate so far, and is conserved from worms (<i>mab3</i> of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>) to mammals (<i>Dmrt-1</i>). Studies of <i>dsx</i> homologues from insect species belonging to different orders position them at the bottom of their sex-determination cascade. The <i>dsx</i> homologues are regulated by a series of upstream regulators that show amazing diversity in different insect species. These results support the Wilkin‚Äôs hypothesis that evolution of the sex-determination cascade has taken place in reverse order, the bottom most gene being most conserved and the upstream genes having been recruited at different times during evolution. The pre-mRNA of <i>dsx</i> is sex-specifically spliced to encode male or female-specific transcription factors that play an important role in the regulation of sexually dimorphic characters in different insect species. The generalization that dsx is required for somatic sexual differentiation culminated with its functional analysis through transgenesis and knockdown experiments in diverse species of insects. This brief review will focus on the similarities and variations of <i>dsx</i> homologues that have been investigated in insects to date.</p>

				<title>Sex determination: insights from the silkworm</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0357-0363</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sex-determining system differs considerably among organisms. Even among insect species, the genetic system for sex-determination is highly diversified. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, somatic sexual differentiation is regulated by a well characterized genetic hierarchy X : A &#62; <i>Sxl</i> &#62; <i>tra/tra2</i> &#62; <i>dsx</i> and <i>fru.</i> This cascade seems to control sex determination in all <i>Drosophila</i> species and is partially conserved in another dipteran species, <i>Ceratitis capitata: Cctra/Cctra-2</i> &#62; <i>Ccdsx</i> and <i>Ccfru</i>. However, in the silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, femaleness is determined by the presence of a dominant feminizing factor on the W chromosome. Moreover, no sex-specific regulatory Sxl homolog has been isolated from <i>B. mori</i>. Also, no <i>tra</i> homolog has yet been found in the <i>Bombyx</i> genome. Despite such differences, <i>dsx</i> homolog of <i>B. mori</i> (<i>Bmdsx</i>) is implicated in the sex determination. <i>Bmdsx</i> produces alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms that encode sex specific transcription factors as observed in <i>dsx</i>. While the female-specific splicing of <i>dsx</i> is activated by splicing activators, Tra and Tra2, the female splicing of <i>Bmdsx</i> represents the default mode. Instead, a splicing inhibitor, BmPSI is involved in the regulation of male-specific splicing of <i>Bmdsx</i>. Since BmPSI does not exhibit any sequence relationship to known SR proteins, such as Tra and Tra2, the regulatory mechanism of sex-specific alternative splicing of <i>Bmdsx</i> is distinct from that of <i>dsx</i>.</p>

				<title>Molecular analysis of sex chromosome-linked mutants in the silkworm <i>Bombyx mori</i></title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0365-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Bombyx mori</i>, the W chromosome determines the female sex. A few W chromosome-linked mutations that cause masculinization of the female genitalia have been found. In female antennae of a recently isolated mutant, both female-type and male-type <i>Bmdsx</i> mRNAs were expressed, and <i>BmOr1</i> (bombykol receptor) and <i>BmOr3</i> (bombykal receptor), which are predominantly expressed in the antennae of male moths, were expressed about 50 times more abundantly in the antennae of mutant females than in those of normal females. These mutants are valuable resources for the molecular analysis of the sex-determination system. Besides the <i>Fem</i> gene, the quantitative egg size-determining gene <i>Esd</i> is thought to be present on the W chromosome, based on the observation that ZWW triploid moths produce larger eggs than ZZW triploids. The most recently updated <i>B. mori</i> genome assembly comprises 20.5 Mb of Z chromosome sequence. Using these sequence data, responsible genes or candidate genes for four Z-linked mutants have been reported. The <i>od</i> (distinct oily) and <i>spli</i> (soft and pliable) are caused by mutation in <i>BmBLOS2</i> and <i>Bmacj6</i>, respectively. <i>Bmap</i> is a candidate gene for $V_g$ (vestigial). Similarly, <i>Bmprm</i> is a candidate gene for <i>Md</i> (muscle dystrophy), causing abnormal development of indirect flight muscle.</p>

				<title>Novel non-autonomous transposable elements onWchromosome of the silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0375-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sex chromosomes of the silkworm <i>Bombyx mori</i> are designated ZW(XY) for females and ZZ (XX) for males. Numerous long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, retroposons and DNA transposons have accumulated as strata on the W chromosome. However, there are nucleotide sequences that do not show the characteristics of typical transposable elements on the W chromosome. To analyse these uncharacterized nucleotide sequences on the W chromosome, we used whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data and assembled data that was obtained using male genome DNA. Through these analyses, we found that almost all of these uncharacterized sequences were non-autonomous transposable elements that do not fit into the conventional classification. It is notable that some of these transposable elements contained the <i>Bombyx</i> short interspersed element (Bm1) sequences in the elements. We designated them as secondary-Bm1 transposable elements (SBTEs). Because putative ancestral SBTE nucleotide sequences without Bm1 do not occur in theWGS data, we suggest that the Bm1 sequences of SBTEs are not carried on each element merely as a package but are components of each element. Therefore, we confirmed that SBTEs should be classified as a new group of transposable elements.</p>

				<title>Meiotic behaviour of tetraploid wheats (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> L.) and their synthetic hexaploid wheat derivates influenced by meiotic restitution and heat stress</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0401-0407</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Meiotic restitution is considered to be a common mechanism of polyploidization in plants and hence is one of the most important processes in plant speciation. Meiotic behaviour of plant chromosomes is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. In this study, the meiotic behaviour of cereal crops was investigated, which includes tetraploid wheat genotypes (with and without the meiotic restitution trait) and their derivates (synthetic hexaploid wheats and a doubled haploid (DH) line), grown at two planting dates in the field. In addition, two local landraces of emmer wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccum</i>), one wheat cultivar (Chinese spring), one DH triticale cultivar (Eleanor) and one rye accession were included. Immature spikes of mid-autumn and end-winter sowing plants were collected in April and May 2008, respectively, fixed in Carnoy‚Äôs solution and stained with hematoxylin. Pollen mother cells (PMCs) from anthers at different stages of meiotic process were analysed for their chromosomal behaviour and irregularities. Meiotic aberrations such as laggards, chromosome bridges, micronuclei, abnormal cytokines, chromatin pulling and meiotic restitution were observed and the studied genotypes were accordingly ranked as follows: triticale &#62; synthetic hexaploid wheats &#62; tetraploid wheats possessing meiotic restitution &#62; tetraploid wheats lacking meiotic restitution &#62; rye. The results indicated that the samples that had been planted in the autumn, thus experiencing an optimum temperature level at the flowering stage, exhibited less meiotic irregularities than winter planting samples that encountered heat stress at the flowering period.</p>

				<title>Mapping of QTL for tiller number at different stages of growth in wheat using double haploid and immortalized F<sub>2</sub> populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0409-0415</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Effective tiller number is one of the most important traits for wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) yield, but the inheritance of tillering is poorly understood. A set of 168 doubled haploid (DH) lines derivatives of a cross between two winter wheat cultivars (Huapei 3 and Yumai 57), and an immortalized F<sub>2</sub> (IF<sub>2</sub>) population generated by randomly permutated intermating of these DHs were investigated, and QTLs of tillering related to the maximum tillering of pre-winter (MTW), maximum tillering in spring (MTS), and effective tillering in harvest (ETH) were mapped. Phenotypic data were collected for the two populations from two different environments. Using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM), a total of 9 and 18 significant QTL were detected across environments for tillering in the DH and IF<sub>2</sub> populations, respectively. Four QTLs were common between two populations. A major QTL located on the 5D chromosome with the allele originating from Yumai 57 was detected and increased 1.92 and 3.55 tillers in MTW and MTS, respectively. QTLs (<i>QMts6D</i>, <i>QEth6D</i>) having a neighbouring marker interval at <i>Xswes679.1</i> and <i>Xcfa2129</i> on chromosome 6D was detected in MTS and ETH. These results provide a better understanding of the genetic factors for selectively expressing the control of tiller number in different growth stages and facilitate marker-assisted selection strategy in breeding.</p>

				<title>Comparing genetic ancestry and self-reported race/ethnicity in a multiethnic population in New York City</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0417-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Self-reported race/ethnicity is frequently used in epidemiological studies to assess an individual‚Äôs background origin. However, in admixed populations such as Hispanic, self-reported race/ethnicity may not accurately represent them genetically because they are admixed with European, African and Native American ancestry. We estimated the proportions of genetic admixture in an ethnically diverse population of 396 mothers and 188 of their children with 35 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) using the STRUCTURE version 2.2 program. The majority of the markers showed significant deviation from Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium in our study population. In mothers self-identified as Black and White, the imputed ancestry proportions were 77.6% African and 75.1% European respectively, while the racial composition among self-identified Hispanics was 29.2% European, 26.0% African, and 44.8% Native American.We also investigated the utility of AIMs by showing the improved fitness of models in paraoxanase-1 genotype‚Äìphenotype associations after incorporating AIMs; however, the improvement was moderate at best. In summary, a minimal set of 35 AIMs is sufficient to detect population stratification and estimate the proportion of individual genetic admixture; however, the utility of these markers remains questionable.</p>

				<title>Transcriptome atlas of eight liver cell types uncovers effects of histidine catabolites on rat liver regeneration</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0425-0436</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Eight liver cell types were isolated using the methods of Percoll density gradient centrifugation and immunomagnetic beads to explore effects of histidine catabolites on rat liver regeneration. Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array was used to detect the expression profiles of genes associated with metabolism of histidine and its catabolites for the above-mentioned eight liver cell types, and bioinformatic and systems biology approaches were employed to analyse the relationship between above genes and rat liver regeneration. The results showed that the urocanic acid (UA) was degraded from histidine in Kupffer cells, acts on Kupffer cells itself and dendritic cells to generate immune suppression by autocrine and paracrine modes. Hepatocytes, biliary epithelia cells, oval cells and dendritic cells can convert histidine to histamine, which can promote sinusoidal endothelial cells proliferation by GsM pathway, and promote the proliferation of hepatocytes and biliary epithelia cells by GqM pathway.</p>

				<title>Polymorphisms in the pituitary growth hormone gene and its receptor associated with coronary artery disease in a predisposed cohort from India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0437-0447</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We investigated the promoter polymorphisms of the pituitary growth hormone gene (<i>GH1</i>) and exon 3 deletion polymorphism (<i>GHRd3</i>) in its receptor gene (<i>GHR</i>) in 299 angiographically proven patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 231 asymptomatic controls enrolled in the ongoing Indian Atherosclerosis Research Study. Real time PCR based analysis of the <i>GHR</i> variant showed significant association of the <i>GHRd3</i> deletion allele with CAD (OR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.30‚Äì0.76, $P = 0.0014$) and a dominant model of inheritance (Akaike information criterion = 482). The deletion allele showed significant association with high plasma HDL-c levels ($P = 0.001$). Sequencing of the proximal promoter region of <i>GH1</i> revealed 12 novel polymorphisms and a <i>TAGA</i> haplotype constituted by the functional SNPs rs2005171, rs11568828, rs2005172 and rs6171, that showed significant association with CAD alone (adjusted OR of 3.31 (95% CI = 1.33‚Äì8.29, $P = 0.011$) and in CAD patients with diabetes ($P = 0.019$). Mean standardized height was associated with three of the four haplotype-tagging SNPs in the cohort ($P \leq 0.03$). Eleven of the 12 polymorphic promoter SNPs contributed to 14.7% of variation in height in females in the whole dataset ($P = 0.029$). CAD patients with history of stroke exhibited marginally significantly lower mean height as compared to rest of the cohort ($P \lt 0.006$). In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in the <i>GHR</i> gene and its ligand, <i>GH1</i>, may modulate the risk of CAD in the Asian Indian population.</p>

				<title>Novel alleles of 31-bp VNTR polymorphism in the human cystathionine ùõΩ-synthase (<i>CBS</i>) gene were detected in healthy Asians</title>

				<page>0449-0455</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 31-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism of the cystathionine ùõΩ-synthase (<i>CBS</i>) gene was earlier reported in Caucasians of predominantly European descent and Indo‚ÄìCaucasoid populations.We report here for the first time, the detection of allele 20, which was absent in Caucasian and Indo‚ÄìCaucasoid populations, as a common allele present in Singaporean Chinese (6.25%), Indians (11.7%), and Malays (11.5%). Hence, allele 20 might be a specific allele for Asian populations. A relatively common allele 19 found in the Caucasian and Indo‚ÄìCaucasoid populations (10.4%‚Äì10.6%) was absent in the Asian samples of this study. Therefore, allele 19 might be a specific allele for the Caucasian populations. A novel and rare allele 13, which was not reported before in the Caucasian and Indo‚ÄìCaucasoid populations, was found in 0.5% of Singaporean Chinese as genotype 13/17 heterozygotes. The presence of alleles 13 and 20 were verified by DNA sequencing. There were five new genotypes (13/17, 16/20, 17/20, 18/20 and 20/20) not reported before in the Caucasian and Indo‚ÄìCaucasoid populations, detected in this study. Nine genotypes (15/18, 16/18, 16/21, 17/19, 18/19, 18/21, 19/19, 19/21 and 21/21) which were present in the Caucasian and/or Indo‚ÄìCaucasoid populations were absent in this study. Our results showed that <i>CBS</i> 31-bp VNTR polymorphism has a distinct genetic difference in allele and genotype frequencies between the European Caucasians, Indo‚ÄìCaucasoid and Asian populations.</p>

				<title>Modifiers and mechanisms of multi-system polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders: lessons from fly models</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0497-0526</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, resulting from a dynamic expansion of glutamine repeats in a polypeptide, are a class of genetically inherited late onset neurodegenerative disorders which, despite expression of the mutated gene widely in brain and other tissues, affect defined subpopulations of neurons in a disease-specific manner. We briefly review the different poly Q-expansion-induced neurodegenerative disorders and the advantages of modelling them in <i>Drosophila</i>. Studies using the fly models have successfully identified a variety of genetic modifiers and have helped in understanding some of the molecular events that follow expression of the abnormal polyQ proteins. Expression of the mutant polyQ proteins causes, as a consequence of intra-cellular and inter-cellular networking, mis-regulation at multiple steps like transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations, cell signalling, protein quality control systems (protein folding and degradation networks), axonal transport machinery etc., in the sensitive neurons, resulting ultimately in their death. The diversity of genetic modifiers of polyQ toxicity identified through extensive genetic screens in fly and other models clearly reflects a complex network effect of the presence of the mutated protein. Such network effects pose a major challenge for therapeutic applications.</p>

				<title>Application of RNA interference in treating human diseases</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0527-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gene silencing can occur either through repression of transcription, termed transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), or through translation repression and mRNA degradation, termed posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). PTGS results from sequence-specific mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm without dramatic changes in transcription of corresponding gene in nucleus. Both TGS and PTGS are used to regulate endogenous genes. Interestingly, mechanisms for gene silencing also protect the genome from transposons and viruses. In this paper, we first review RNAi mechanism and then focus on some of its applications in biomedical research such as treatment for HIV, viral hepatitis, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic disease, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.</p>

				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0539-0554</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tribe <i>Triticeae</i> includes major cereal crops (bread wheat, durum wheat, triticale, barley and rye), as well as abundant forage and lawn grasses. Wheat and its wild related species possess numerous favourable genes for yield improvement, grain quality enhancement, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, and constitute a giant gene pool for wheat improvement. In recent years, significant progress on molecular characterization and functional analysis of elite genes in wheat and its related species have been achieved. In this paper, we review the cloned functional genes correlated with grain quality, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, photosystem and nutrition utilization in wheat and its related species.</p>

				<title>Correlations between genetic variance and adiposity measures, and gene &#215; gene interactions for obesity in postmenopausal Vietnamese women</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0001-0009</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although environmental factors are important, there is considerable evidence that genes also have a significant role in the pathogenesis of obesity. We conducted a population-based study to investigate the relationship between candidate genes for obesity (<i>UCP1, UCP2, ADRA2B, ADRB3, LEPR, VDR</i> and <i>ESR1</i>) and adiposity measures (body mass index, body fat percentage, weight, waist circumference and waist‚Äìhip ratio) in terms of individual gene and gene &#215; gene interaction in models unadjusted and adjusted for covariates (age, years since menopause, educational level and total energy intake). Postmenopausal women with TC genotype of <i>ESR1</i> gene had higher body fat percentage than those with TT genotype in the models unadjusted and adjusted for the covariates ($P = 0.006$ in adjusted model). In multiple logistic regression analysis, <i>BsmI</i> and <i>ApaI</i> <i>SNPs</i> of <i>VDR</i> genes were significantly associated with overweight and obesity. The <i>UCP2‚ÄìVDR ApaI</i> interaction to susceptibility of overweight and obesity was first observed from logistic regression analysis, and then confirmed in the multifactor dimensionality reduction method unadjusted and adjusted for the covariates. This interaction had 69.09% prediction accuracy for overweight and obesity ($P = 0.001$, sign test). In conclusion, the study suggests the significant association of <i>ESR1</i> and <i>VDR</i> genes with adiposity measures and the <i>UCP2‚ÄìVDR ApaI</i> interaction to susceptibility to being overweight and obesity in postmenopausal Vietnamese women.</p>

				<title>Determination of genetic relationships among elite thermosensitive genic male sterile lines (TGMS) of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) employing morphological and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0011-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A set of morphological traits and SSR markers were used to determine the genetic relationship among 12 elite thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines developed at three different research institutions of India. Agro-morphological data recorded on 20 morphological traits revealed a wide base of genetic variation and a set of four morphological traits could distinguish most of the TGMS lines. Analysis with 30 SSR markers (20 EST-SSRs and 10 genomic SSRs) revealed 27 markers to be polymorphic, amplifying a total of 83 alleles. Each SSR marker amplified 2‚Äì6 alleles with an average of 2.76 alleles per marker and a PIC value varying from 0.54 to 0.96. Cluster analysis based on SSR and morphological data clearly differentiated the lines according to their source of origin. Correlation analysis between morphological and molecular data revealed a very poor association ($r = 0.06$), which could be attributed to selection pressure, genetic drift, sampling error and unknown relationship among related lines. The SSR markers discriminated the genotypes distinctly and quantified the genetic diversity precisely among the TGMS lines. Data on the yield per plant indicated that the genotypes grouping under a similar cluster showed same heterotic behaviour as compared to the genotypes from different clusters when crossed to similar pollinators.</p>

					<p>Somatic chromosome number and detailed karyotype analysis were carried out in six Indian <i>Momordica</i> species viz. <i>M. balsamina, M. charantia, M. cochinchinensis, M. dioica, M. sahyadrica</i> and <i>M. cymbalaria</i> (syn. <i>Luffa cymbalaria</i>; a taxon of controversial taxonomic identity). The somatic chromosome number $2n = 22$ was reconfirmed in monoecious species (<i>M. balsamina</i> and <i>M. charantia</i>). Out of four dioecious species, the chromosome number was reconfirmed in <i>M. cochinchinensis</i> $(2n = 28)$, <i>M. dioica</i> $(2n = 28)$ and <i>M. subangulata</i> subsp. <i>renigera</i> $(2n = 56)$, while in <i>M. sahyadrica</i> $(2n = 28)$ somatic chromosome number was reported for the first time. A new chromosome number of $2n = 18$ was reported in <i>M. cymbalaria</i> against its previous reports of $2n = 16$, 22. The karyotype analysis of all the species revealed significant numerical and structural variations of chromosomes. It was possible to distinguish chromosomes of <i>M. cymbalaria</i> from other <i>Momordica</i> species and also between monoecious and dioecious taxa of the genus. Morphology and crossability among the dioecious species was also studied. Evidence from morphology, crossability, pollen viability and chromosome synapsis suggests a segmental allopolyploid origin for <i>M. subangulata</i> subsp. <i>renigera</i>. The taxonomic status of the controversial taxon <i>M. cymbalaria</i> was also discussed using morphological, karyological and crossability data.</p>

				<title>Chromosome analysis of five Brazilian species of poison frogs (Anura: Dendrobatidae)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0031-0037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dendrobatid frogs have undergone an extensive systematic reorganization based on recent molecular findings. The present work describes karyotypes of the Brazilian species <i>Adelphobates castaneoticus, A. quinquevittatus, Ameerega picta, A. galactonotus</i> and <i>Dendrobates tinctorius</i> which were compared to each other and with previously described related species. All karyotypes consisted of $2n = 18$ chromosomes, except for <i>A. picta</i> which had $2n = 24$. The karyotypes of the <i>Adelphobates</i> and <i>D. tinctorius</i> species were highly similar to each other and to the other $2n = 18$ previously studied species, revealing conserved karyotypic characteristics in both genera. In recent phylogenetic studies, all <i>Adelphobates</i> species were grouped in a clade separated from the <i>Dendrobates</i> species. Thus, we hypothesized that their common karyotypic traits may have a distinct origin by chromosome rearrangements and mutations. In <i>A. picta</i>, with $2n = 24$, chromosome features of pairs from 1 to 8 are shared with other previously karyotyped species within this genus. Hence, the <i>A. picta</i> data reinforced that the C-banding pattern and the NOR location are species-specific traits in the genus <i>Ameerega</i>. Moreover, the <i>Ameerega</i> monophyletism proposed by previous phylogenetic studies indicates that the karyotypic differences among species in this genus result from a long divergence time.</p>

				<title>Validation and dissection of quantitative trait loci for leaf traits in interval RM4923-RM402 on the short arm of rice chromosome 6</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0039-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Validation and dissection of a QTL region for leaf traits in rice which has been reported in a number of independent studies were conducted. Three sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) were originated from a residual heterozygous line derived the <i>indica</i> cross Zhenshan 97B/Milyang 46. They were overlapping and totally covered a 4.2-Mb heterogenous region extending from RM4923 to RM402 on the short arm of rice chromosome 6. Each NIL set consisted of 10 maternal lines and 10 paternal lines. They were measured for the length, width, perimeter and area of the top three leaves and the number of spikelets per panicle, number of grains per panicle and grain weight per panicle. In NIL sets 6-4 and 6-7, differing in intervals RM4923-RM225 and RM19410-RM6119, respectively, significant variations with the enhancing alleles from the female parent ZS97 were shown for the length, perimeter and area except for the area of the third leaf from top in 6-4, but the effects were lower in 6-4 than in 6-7. No significant effects were detected for the three traits in the remaining NIL set. It was shown that flag leaf length (FLL) is the primary target of the QTLs detected. Two QTLs for FLL linked in repulsion phase were resolved, of which <i>qFLL6.2</i> located in the 1.19-Mb interval RM3414-RM6917 had a major effect with the enhancing allele from Zhenshan 97B, and <i>qFLL6.1</i> located in the 946.8-kb interval RM19350-RM19410 had a smaller effect with the enhancing allele from Milyang 46. The two QTLs also exerted pleiotropic effects on the yield traits.</p>

				<title>Occurrence of differential meiotic associations and additional chromosomes in the embryo-sac mother cells of <i>Allium roylei</i> Stearn</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0045-0049</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A small population of complex translocation heterozygote plants of <i>Allium roylei</i> from the Bani region of Jammu Province was studied for meiosis in the female track. This study resulted in identification of two variants, having embryo-sac mother cells (EMCs) with more than 16 chromosomes. EMCs of the remaining plants invariably had diploid $(2n = 16)$ chromosome complement. Female meiosis, in general, was found to be abnormal, with nearly 23% and 11% chromosomes associating as quadrivalents or trivalents at prophase I and at metaphase I, respectively. This was followed by irregular segregation of chromosomes at anaphase I. Amongst the variants; one had 38% EMCs with eight bivalents plus two small sized chromosomes. Their small size, dispensable nature and tendency to affect the pairing behaviour of normal complement are some of the features that latter chromosomes share with the B chromosomes. Seventeen to nineteen chromosomes were observed in 35% EMCs of other variant; the remaining cells had 16 chromosomes. Chromosomal behaviour in both kind of cells (euploid and aneuploid) was more or less similar. Unlike female meiocytes, male meiocytes analysed earlier of this strain always had 16 chromosomes which paired to form extremely complex associations involving 3‚Äì16 chromosomes. The most likely cause of this asynchrony with regards to number of chromosomes involved in multivalent formation seems to be interaction of genes controlling chiasma formation with the different physiological conditions of male and female meiocytes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Knowledge of genetic correlations is essential to understand the joint evolution of traits through correlated responses to selection, a difficult and seldom, very precise task even with easy-to-breed species. Here, a simulation-based method to estimate genetic correlations and genetic covariances that relies only on phenotypic measurements is proposed. The method does not require any degree of relatedness in the sampled individuals. Extensive numerical results suggest that the propose method may provide relatively efficient estimates regardless of sample sizes and contributions from common environmental effects.</p>

				<title>Mapping of shoot fly tolerance loci in sorghum using SSR markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0059-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench) is one of the most important crops in the semiarid regions of the world. One of the important biotic constraints to sorghum production in India is the shoot fly which attacks sorghum at the seedling stage. Identification of the genomic regions containing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to shoot fly and the linked markers can facilitate sorghum improvement programmes through marker-assisted selection. A simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker-based skeleton linkage map of two linkage groups of sorghum was constructed in a population of 135 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a cross between IS18551 (resistant to shoot fly) and 296B (susceptible to shoot fly). A total of 14 SSR markers, seven each on linkage groups A and C were mapped. Using data of different shoot fly resistance component traits, one QTL which is common for glossiness, oviposition and dead hearts was detected following composite interval mapping (CIM) on linkage group A. The phenotypic variation explained by this QTL ranged from 3.8%‚Äì6.3%. Besides the QTL detected by CIM, two more QTLs were detected following multi-trait composite interval mapping (MCIM), one each on linkage groups A and C for the combinations of traits which were correlated with each other. Results of the present study are novel as we could find out the QTLs governing more than one trait (pleiotropic QTLs). The identification of pleiotropic QTLs will help in improvement of more than one trait at a time with the help of the same linked markers. For all the QTLs, the resistant parent IS18551 contributed resistant alleles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic correlations of nutrient quality traits including lysine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine and threonine contents in rapeseed meal were analysed by the genetic model for quantitative traits of diploid plants using a diallel design with nine parents of <i>Brassica napus</i> L. These results indicated that the genetic correlations of embryo, cytoplasm and/or maternal plant havemade different contribution to total genetic correlations of most pairwise nutrient quality traits. The genetic correlations among the amino acids in rapeseed meal were simultaneously controlled by genetic main correlations and genotype &#215; environment (GE) interaction correlations, especially for the maternal dominance correlations. Most components of genetic main correlations and GE interaction correlations for the pairwise traits studied were significantly positive. Some of the pairwise traits had negative genetic correlations, especially between valine and other amino acid contents. Indirect selection for improving the quality traits of rapeseed meal could be expected in rape breeding according to the magnitude and direction of genetic correlation components.</p>

				<title>QTL mapping for test weight by using F<sub>2:3</sub> population in maize</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0075-0080</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Test weight is an important trait in maize breeding. Understanding the genetic mechanism of test weight is important for effective selection of maize test weight improvement. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for maize test weight were identified. In the years 2007 and 2008, a F<sub>2:3</sub> population along with the parents Chang7-2 and Zheng58 were planted in Zhengzhou, People‚Äôs Republic of China. Significant genotypic variation for maize test weight was observed in both years. Based on the genetic map containing 180 polymorphic SSR markers with an average linkage distance of 11.0 cM, QTL for maize test weight were analysed by mixed-model composite interval mapping. Five QTL, including four QTL with only additive effects, were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and together explained 25.2% of the phenotypic variation. Seven pairs of epistatic interactions were also detected, involving 11 loci distributed on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, respectively, which totally contributed 18.2% of the phenotypic variation. However, no significant QTL &#215; environment (Q&#215;E) interaction and epistasis &#215; environment interaction effects were detected. The results showed that besides the additive QTL, epistatic interactions also formed an important genetic basis for test weight in maize.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are one population of adult stem cells that can self renew and differentiate into multiple lineages. Because of advantages in method and quantity of acquisition, ADSCs are gaining attention as an alternative source of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. In this study, we performed microRNA profiling of undifferentiated and of neurally-differentiated ADSCs to identify the responsible microRNAs in neurogenesis using this type of stem cell. MicroRNAs from four different donors were analysed by microarray. Compared to the undifferentiation control, we identified 39‚Äì101 microRNAs with more than two-fold higher expression and 3‚Äì9 microRNAs with two-fold lower expression. The identified microRNAs were further analysed in terms of gene ontology (GO) in relation with neurogenesis, based on their target mRNAs predicted by computational analysis. This study revealed the specific microRNAs involved in neurogenesis via microRNA microarray, and may provide the basic information for genetic induction of adult stem cell differentiation using microRNAs.</p>

				<title>Physical localization of NORs and ITS length variants in old Portuguese durum wheat cultivars</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0095-0101</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The variation at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA has been correlated with the number of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) in some plant species. Besides, the number of NORs might influence the rate of homogenization of the rDNA repeats. In recent studies, ITS length variants were detected in bread wheat cultivars but no reports about their presence in durum wheat were found. In the present study, we localized and identified the NORs of 51 old Portuguese durum wheat cultivars by using sequential silver staining and fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization performed with the pTa71 rDNA probe. We also detected ITS length variants by PCR-RFLP. No variation at the number of Ag-NORs per metaphase was found among the 51 durum wheat cultivars, but the PCR-RFLP technique carried out with the restriction enzyme <i>Hpa</i>II, allowed the detection of ITS length variants among them. The molecular data was used in order to establish the genetic relationships among cultivars and botanical varieties of durum wheat. The knowledge of this feature could be useful for future design of breeding strategies, involving this collection that constitutes an excellent repository of germplasm in Portugal.</p>

				<title>The first genetic map of pigeon pea based on diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0103-0109</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With an objective to develop a genetic map in pigeon pea (<i>Cajanus</i> spp.), a total of 554 diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers showed polymorphism in a pigeon pea F<sub>2</sub> mapping population of 72 progenies derived from an interspecific cross of ICP 28 (<i>Cajanus cajan</i>) and ICPW 94 (<i>Cajanus scarabaeoides</i>). Approximately 13% of markers did not conform to expected segregation ratio. The total number of DArT marker loci segregating in Mendelian manner was 405 with 73.1% ($P \gt 0.001$) of DArT markers having unique segregation patterns. Two groups of genetic maps were generated using DArT markers. While the maternal genetic linkage map had 122 unique DArT maternal marker loci, the paternal genetic linkage map has a total of 172 unique DArT paternal marker loci. The length of these two maps covered 270.0 cM and 451.6 cM, respectively. These are the first genetic linkage maps developed for pigeon pea, and this is the first report of genetic mapping in any grain legume using diversity arrays technology.</p>

				<title>Analysis of the heterochromatin of <i>Cebus</i> (Primates, Platyrrhini) by micro-FISH and banding pattern comparisons</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0111-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The karyotype of the neotropical primate genus <i>Cebus</i> (Platyrrhini: Cebidae), considered the most ancestral one, shows the greatest amount of heterochromatin described among Platyrrhini genera. Banding techniques and restriction enzyme digestion have previously revealed great variability of quantity and composition of heterochromatin in this genus. In this context, we use fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) to analyse this genomic region and discuss its possible role in the diversification of <i>Cebus</i>. We used a heterochromatin probe for chromosome 11 of <i>Cebus libidinosus</i> (11qHe+ CLI probe), obtained by chromosome microdissection. Twenty-six specimens belonging to the families Atelidae, Cebidae, Callitrichidae and Pithecidae (Platyrrhini) were studied. Fourteen out of 26 specimens were <i>Cebus</i> (Cebidae) individuals of <i>C. libidinosus, C. xanthosternos, C. apella, C. nigritus, C. albifrons, C. kaapori</i> and <i>C. olivaceus</i>. In <i>Cebus</i> specimens, we found 6 to 22 positive signals located in interstitial and telomeric positions along the different species. No hybridization signal was observed among the remaining Ceboidea species, thus reinforcing the idea of a <i>Cebus</i>-specific heterochromatin composed of a complex system of repetitive sequences.</p>

				<title>Identification of possible genetic polymorphisms involved in cancer cachexia: a systematic review</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0165-0177</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cancer cachexia is a polygenic and complex syndrome. Genetic variations in regulation of the inflammatory response, muscle and fat metabolic pathways, and pathways in appetite regulation are likely to contribute to the susceptibility or resistance to developing cancer cachexia. A systematic search of Medline and EmBase databases, covering 1986‚Äì2008 was performed for potential candidate genes/genetic polymorphisms relating to cancer cachexia. Related genes were then identified using pathway functional analysis software. All candidate genes were reviewed for functional polymorphisms or clinically significant polymorphisms associated with cachexia using the OMIM and GeneRIF databases. Genes with variants which had functional or clinical associations with cachexia and replicated in at least one study were entered into pathway analysis software to reveal possible network associations between genes. A total of 184 polymorphisms with functional or clinical relevance to cancer cachexia were identified in 92 candidate genes. Of these, 42 polymorphisms (in 33 genes) were replicated in more than one study with 13 polymorphisms found to influence two or more hallmarks of cachexia (i.e. inflammation, loss of fat mass and/or lean mass and reduced survival). Thirty-three genes were found to be significantly interconnected in two major networks with four genes (<i>ADIPOQ, IL6, NFKB1</i> and <i>TLR4</i>) interlinking both networks. Selection of candidate genes and polymorphisms is a key element of multigene study design. The present study provides an initial framework to select genes/polymorphisms for further study in cancer cachexia, and to develop their potential as susceptibility biomarkers of developing cachexia.</p>

				<title>Genetic polymorphism of serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR: involvement in smoking behaviour</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0179-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Data suggest that the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders and may also be involved in smoking behaviour since nicotine increases brain serotonin secretion. It is known that smoking behaviour is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The present review examines the role of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) in smoking behaviour and investigating studies that showed association of 5-HTT gene with smoking. This study discusses a polymorphism which has been investigated by many researchers, as the bi-allelic insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 5&#8242;-flanking promoter region (5-HTTLPR). This gene has received considerable attention in attempts to understand the molecular determinants of smoking. Therefore, in the present study, the relationship between genetic polymorphism of serotonin transporter in smoking behaviour is reviewed considering the interactive effect of genetic factors.</p>

				<title>Genetic admixture studies on four <i>in situ</i> evolved, two migrant and twenty-one ethnic populations of Tamil Nadu, south India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0191-0202</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We analysed the genetic structure of &#8764;1000 samples representing 27 ethnic groups settled in Tamil Nadu, south India, derived from two linguistic families (Dravidians and Indo‚ÄìEuropeans) representing four religious groups (Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and Jainism) using 11 mtDNA markers. Out of 27 ethnic groups, four are <i>in situ</i> populations (Anglo-Indian, Labbai Muslim, Nadar Christian and south Indian Jain) and two are migrants (Gypsy and north Indian Jain) from north India to Tamil Nadu, and 21 are native ethnic groups. Six of the markers we used were monomorphic (<i>Hae</i>III663, <i>Hpa</i>I3592, <i>Alu</i>I5176, <i>Alu</i>I7025, <i>Alu</i>I13262, 9-bp deletion) and five markers were polymorphic (<i>Dde</i>I10394, <i>Alu</i>I10397, <i>Hin</i>fI12308, <i>Hin</i>cII13259 and <i>Hae</i>III16517). Haplogroup frequencies, genetic affinities and admixture analysis are based on the genotype data of polymorphic markers observed in these populations. Haplogroup frequencies indicate that various ethnic groups entered Tamil Nadu during different time periods. Genetic affinities and admixture estimates revealed that the ethnic groups possessing advanced knowledge of farming cluster in a branch (C), and could be the late arrived settlers as agriculture, was introduced to this region at about 5 to 3 thousand years ago. <i>In situ</i> ethnic groups appear to have arisen at various times as a result of the prevailing dominant socio-cultural forces. Hierarchical Hindu caste system created many ethnic groups in the history of its existence; some of them became isolated for considerable period of time. Over all, among Tamil ethnic groups, in spite of caste systems‚Äô rigidity, built in flexibility in the system in the form of hypergamy and hypogamy had allowed maternal gene flow between them.</p>

				<title>Intergenic spacer length variants in Old Portuguese bread wheat cultivars</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0203-0208</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The intergenic spacer of the ribosomal DNA is highly variable, but is location specific in the nucleolar organizer region of the chromosomes. This study provides an event of high level of polymorphism / size variation and occurrence of 14 unique phenotypes in 48 landraces of Portuguese bread wheat cultivars for IGS-amplified products obtained by PCR-RFLP technique performed with <i>Taq</i>I. The attendant IGS polymorphism has been used to deduce affinities between landraces. Some of the high molecular weight IGS allelic variants were also probed for their chromosomal localization by sequential silver nitrate staining and fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization. However, only the intergenic spacer allelic variant of 3.1 kb could be successfully hybridized, and was observed to be physically located on the chromosome pair 1B in the <i>NOR</i> loci of the cultivar ‚ÄòMagueija‚Äô.</p>

				<title>Quantitative trait loci for rice yield-related traits using recombinant inbred lines derived from two diverse cultivars</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0209-0215</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The thousand-grain weight and spikelets per panicle directly contribute to rice yield. Heading date and plant height also greatly influence the yield. Dissection of genetic bases of yield-related traits would provide tools for yield improvement. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for spikelets per panicle, thousand-grain weight, heading date and plant height was performed using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two diverse cultivars, Nanyangzhan and Chuan7. In total, 20 QTLs were identified for four traits. They were located to 11 chromosomes except on chromosome 4. Seven and five QTLs were detected for thousand-grain weight and spikelets per panicle, respectively. Four QTLs were identified for both heading date and plant height. About half the QTLs were commonly detected in both years, 2006 and 2007. Six QTLs are being reported for the first time. Two QTL clusters were identified in regions flanked by RM22065 and RM5720 on chromosome 7 and by RM502 and RM264 on chromosome 8, respectively. The parent, Nanyangzhan with heavy thousand-grain weight, carried alleles with increased effects on all seven thousand-grain weight QTL, which explained why there was no transgressive segregation for thousand-grain weight in the population. In contrast, Chuan7 with more spikelets per panicle carried positive alleles at all five spikelets per panicle QTL except <i>qspp5</i>. Further work on distinction between pleiotropic QTL and linked QTL is needed in two yield-related QTL clusters.</p>

				<title>Evolutionary process of a tetranucleotide microsatellite locus in Acipenseriformes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0217-0227</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The evolutionary dynamics of the tetra-nucleotide microsatellite locus <i>Spl-106</i> were investigated at the repeat and flanking sequences in 137 individuals of 15 Acipenseriform species, giving 93 homologous sequences, which were detected in 11 out of 15 species. Twenty-three haplotypes of flanking sequences and three distinct types of repeats, type I, type II and type III, were found within these 93 sequences. The MS-Align phylogenetic method, newly applied to microsatellite sequences, permitted us to understand the repeat and flanking sequence evolution of <i>Spl-106</i> locus. The flanking region of locus <i>Spl-106</i> was highly conserved among the species of genera <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Huso</i> and <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>, which diverged about 150 million years ago (Mya). The rate of flanking sequence divergence at the microsatellite locus <i>Spl-106</i> in sturgeons is between 0.011% and 0.079% with an average at 0.028% per million years. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic trees produced by MS-Align showed that both the flanking and repeat regions can cluster the alleles of different species into Pacific and Atlantic lineages. Our results show a synchronous evolutionary pattern between the flanking and repeat regions. Moreover, the coexistence of different repeat types in the same species, even in the same individual, is probably due to two duplication events encompassing the locus <i>Spl-106</i> that occurred during the divergence of Pacific lineage. The first occured before the diversification of Pacific species (121‚Äì96 Mya) and led to repeat types I and II. The second occurred more recently, just before the speciation of <i>A. sinensis</i> and <i>A. dabryanus</i> (69‚Äì10 Mya), and led to repeat type III. Sequences in the same species with different repeat types probably corresponds to paralogous loci. This study sheds a new light on the evolutionary mechanisms that shape the complex microsatellite loci involving different repeat types.</p>

				<title>Phenotypic and molecular characterization of selected tomato recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross <i>Solanum lycopersicum &#215; S. pimpinellifolium</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0229-0237</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An important trait defining fresh tomato marketability is fruit shelf life. Exotic germplasm of <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i> is able to prolong shelf life. Sixteen recombinant inbred lines with differing values of shelf life and fruit weight were derived by antagonistic-divergent selection from an interspecific cross involving <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>. The objective of this study was to evaluate these recombinant inbred lines for many fruit quality traits such as diameter, height, size, acidity, colour, firmness, shelf life and weight, and to characterize them by amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. For most traits, a wide range of genetic variability was found and a wide range of molecular variation was also detected. Both sets of data allowed the identification of recombinant inbred lines by means of cluster analysis and principal component analysis. Genetic association among some amplified fragment length polymorphism markers and fruit quality traits, suggested by the principal component analysis, could be identified by single point analysis. Potential molecular markers underlying agronomical traits were detected in these recombinant inbred lines.</p>

				<title>Cullin-5 and cullin-2 play a role in the development of neuromuscular junction and the female germ line of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0239-0249</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cullins confer substrate specificity to E3-ligases which are multi-protein complexes involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation or modification. There are six cullin genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We have raised an antibody against Cul-5 and demonstrated that it expresses in neuronal and non-neuronal cells throughout development. In the embryonic tracheal system, Cul-5 is enriched at fusion sites together with E-Cadherin and Fasciclin III. Mutations of <i>cul-5</i> do not affect tracheal development but do show defects in the organization of synaptic boutons at the larval neuromuscular junction where the protein is expressed in a subset of motoneuron terminals. Loss of function of another <i>cullin</i> gene ‚Äò<i>cul-2</i>‚Äô results in similar defects at the larval neuromuscular junction although <i>cul-2;cul-5</i> double mutants do not show an enhanced phenotype. Both <i>cul-2</i> and <i>cul-5</i> mutants show similar aberrations in the development of female germ line. Our results suggest that both of these cullin proteins participate in similar developmental processes.</p>

				<title>RAPD and microsatellite transferability studies in selected species of <i>Prosopis</i> (section Algarobia) with emphasis on <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> and <i>P. pallida</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0251-0264</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The genus <i>Prosopis</i> (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae), comprises 44 species widely distributed in arid and semi-arid zones. <i>Prosopis pallida</i> (Humb. &amp; Bonpl. ex Willd.) Kunth and <i>P. juliflora</i> (Sw.) DC. are the two species that are truly tropical apart from <i>P. africana</i>, which is native to tropical Africa (Pasiecznik <i>et al.</i> 2004), and they have been introduced widely beyond their native ranges. However, taxonomic confusion within the genus has hampered exploitation and better management of the species. The present study focusses primarily on evaluating the genetic relationship between <i>Prosopis</i> species from the section Algarobia, containing most species of economic importance, though <i>P. tamarugo</i> from section Strombocarpa is also included for comparison. In total, 12 <i>Prosopis</i> species and a putative <i>P. pallida &#215; P. chilensis</i> hybrid were assessed for their genetic relationships based on RAPD markers and microsatellite transferability. The results show that <i>P. pallida</i> and <i>P. juliflora</i> are not closely related despite some morphological similarity. Evidence also agrees with previous studies which suggest that the grouping of series in section Algarobia is artificial.</p>

				<title>Association of <i>ADAM33</i> gene polymorphisms with adult-onset asthma and its severity in an Indian adult population</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0265-0273</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>ADAM33</i>, a member of the <i>ADAM</i> (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) gene family, is an asthma susceptibility gene originally identified by positional cloning. In the present study, we investigated the possible association of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>ADAM33</i> (rs511898, rs528557, rs44707, rs597980 and rs2787094) with adult-onset asthma in an Indian population. The study included 175 patients with mild intermittent ($n = 44$), mild persistent ($n = 108$) or moderate persistent ($n = 23$) subgroups of asthma, and 253 nonasthmatic control individuals. SNPs were genotyped with the help of restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) method, and data were analysed using chi-square test and logistic regression model. Bonferroni‚Äôs correction for multiple comparisons was applied for each hypothesis. Genotypes and allele frequencies of SNPs rs511898 and rs528557 were significantly associated with adult-onset asthma ($P = 0.010-\lt 0.001$). A significant association of the homozygous mutant genotype and mutant alleles of SNPs rs2787094, rs44707 and rs597980 with the asthma was also observed ($P = 0.020-\lt 0.001$). A positive association between asthma and haplotypes AGCCT, GGCCT, AGACT, GCAGT, GGACT, ACCCC and AGACC were also found ($P = 0.036-\lt 0.001$, OR $= 2.07-8.49$). Haplotypes AGCGT, GCAGC, ACAGC, ACAGT, GGAGC and GGCGT appear to protect against asthma ($P = 0.013-\lt 0.0001$, OR $= 0.34-0.10$). Our data suggest that ADAM33 gene polymorphisms serve as genetic risk factors for asthma in Indian adult population.</p>

				<title>A new strategy for estimating two-locus recombination fractions under some natural inequality restrictions</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0275-0282</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Linkage analysis is now being widely used to map markers on each chromosome in the human genome, to map genetic diseases, and to identify genetic forms of common diseases. Two-locus linkage analysis and multi-locus analysis have been investigated comprehensively, and many computer programs have been developed to perform linkage analysis. Yet there exists a shortcoming in traditional methods, i.e., the parameter space of two-locus recombination fractions has not been emphasized sufficiently in the usual analyses. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for estimating the two-locus recombination fractions based on data of backcross family in the framework of some natural and necessary parameter restrictions. The new strategy is based on a restricted projection algorithm, which can provide fast reasonable estimates of recombination fraction, and can therefore serve as a superior alternative algorithm. Results obtained from both real and simulated data indicate that the new algorithm performs well in the estimation of recombination fractions and outperforms current methods.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A stable, highly fertile wheat <i>Secale africanum</i> substitution line LF24, derived from the F<sub>7</sub> generation of a cross between Mianyang11 (MY11) and <i>Triticum durum, S. africanum</i> amphiploid (YF) was identified through molecular cytogenetic analysis. Application of C-banding, <i>in situ</i> hybridization and molecular markers analysis showed that LF24 was a wheat <i>S. africanum</i> 2R<sup>a</sup>(2D) substitution line. When inoculated with stripe rust isolates, <i>T. durum</i> and MY11 were highly susceptible, while <i>S. africanum</i>, YF and LF24 were immune. It is confirmed through molecular cytogenetic analysis that the stripe rust resistance of LF24 was derived from <i>S. africanum</i> chromosome 2R<sup>a</sup>. We compared the banding patterns and disease resistance of reported chromosomes 2R from different <i>S. cereale</i> introduced into wheat background, and found that there was new stripe rust resistance gene(s) on <i>S. africanum</i> 2R<sup>a</sup>. LF24 is a new substitution line which can be used as stripe rust resistant source in wheat improvement.</p>

				<title>Chromosome numbers and meiotic analysis in the pre-breeding of <i>Brachiaria decumbens</i> (Poaceae)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0289-0294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A total of 44 accessions of <i>Brachiaria decumbens</i> were analysed for chromosome count and meiotic behaviour in order to identify potential progenitors for crosses. Among them, 15 accessions presented $2n = 18$; 27 accessions, $2n = 36$; and 2 accessions, $2n = 45$ chromosomes. Among the diploid accessions, the rate of meiotic abnormalities was low, ranging from 0.82% to 7.93%. In the 27 tetraploid accessions, the rate of meiotic abnormalities ranged from 18.41% to 65.83%. The most common meiotic abnormalities were related to irregular chromosome segregation, but chromosome stickiness and abnormal cytokinesis were observed in low frequency. All abnormalities can compromise pollen viability by generating unbalanced gametes. Based on the chromosome number and meiotic stability, the present study indicates the apomictic tetraploid accessions that can act as male genitor to produce interspecific hybrids with <i>B. ruziziensis</i> or intraspecific hybrids with recently artificially tetraploidized accessions.</p>

				<title>Thermal phenotypic plasticity of body size in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: sexual dimorphism and genetic correlations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0295-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thirty isofemale lines collected in three different years from the same wild French population were grown at seven different temperatures (12‚Äì31&#176;C). Two linear measures, wing and thorax length, were taken on 10 females and 10 males of each line at each temperature, also enabling the calculation of the wing/thorax (W/T) ratio, a shape index related to wing loading. Genetic correlations were calculated using family means. The W‚ÄìT correlation was independent of temperature and on average, 0.75. For each line, characteristic values of the temperature reaction norm were calculated, i.e. maximum value, temperature of maximum value and curvature. Significant negative correlations were found between curvature and maximum value or temperature of maximum value. Sexual dimorphism was analysed by considering either the correlation between sexes or the female/male ratio. Female‚Äìmale correlation was on average 0.75 at the within line, within temperature level but increased up to 0.90 when all temperatures were averaged for each line. The female/male ratio was genetically variable among lines but without any temperature effect. For the female/male ratio, heritability (intraclass correlation) was about 0.20 and evolvability (genetic coefficient of variation) close to 1. Although significant, these values are much less than for the traits themselves. Phenotypic plasticity of sexual dimorphism revealed very similar reaction norms for wing and thorax length, i.e. a monotonically increasing sigmoid curve from about 1.11 up to 1.17. This shows that the males are more sensitive to a thermal increase than females. In contrast, the W/T ratio was almost identical in both sexes, with only a very slight temperature effect.</p>

				<title>Hypermutation and stress adaptation in bacteria</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0383-0391</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Hypermutability is a phenotype characterized by a moderate to high elevation of spontaneous mutation rates and could result from DNA replication errors, defects in error correction mechanisms and many other causes. The elevated mutation rates are helpful to organisms to adapt to sudden and unforeseen threats to survival. At the same time hypermutability also leads to the generation of many deleterious mutations which offset its adaptive value and therefore disadvantageous. Nevertheless, it is very common in nature, especially among clinical isolates of pathogens. Hypermutability is inherited by indirect (second order) selection along with the beneficial mutations generated. At large population sizes and high mutation rates many cells in the population could concurrently acquire beneficial mutations of varying adaptive (fitness) values. These lineages compete with the ancestral cells and also among themselves for fixation. The one with the ‚Äòfittest‚Äô mutation gets fixed ultimately while the others are lost. This has been called ‚Äòclonal interference‚Äô which puts a speed limit on adaptation. The original clonal interference hypothesis has been modified recently. Nonheritable (transient) hypermtability conferring significant adaptive benefits also occur during stress response although its molecular basis remains controversial. The adaptive benefits of heritable hypermutability are discussed with emphasis on host‚Äìpathogen interactions.</p>

				<title>Domain combination of the vertebrate-like TLR gene family: implications for their origin and evolution</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0401-0408</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Domain shuffling, which is an important mechanism in the evolution of multi-domain proteins, has shaped the evolutionary development of the immune system in animals. Toll and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate and adaptive immune systems. Draft genome sequences provide the opportunity to compare the Toll/TLR gene repertoire among representative metazoans. In this study, we investigated the combination of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains of metazoan Toll/TLRs. Before Toll with both domains occurred in Cnidaria (sea anemone, <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>), through domain combinations, TIR-only and LRR-only proteins had already appeared in sponges (<i>Amphimedon queenslandica</i>). Although vertebrate-like TIR (V-TIR) domain already appeared in Cnidaria, the vertebrate-like TLR (V-TLR) with both domains appeared much later. The first combination between V-TIR domain and vertebrate-like LRR (V-LRR) domain for V-TLR may have occurred after the divergence of Cnidaria and bilateria. Then, another combination for V-TLR, a recombination of both domains, possibly occurred before or during the evolution of primitive vertebrates. Taken together, two rounds of domain combinations may thus have co-shaped the vertebrate TLRs.</p>

				<title>Wheat kernel dimensions: how do they contribute to kernel weight at an individual QTL level?</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0409-0425</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Kernel dimensions (KD) contribute greatly to thousand-kernel weight (TKW) in wheat. In the present study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for TKW, kernel length (KL), kernel width (KW) and kernel diameter ratio (KDR) were detected by both conditional and unconditional QTL mapping methods. Two related F8:9 recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, comprising 485 and 229 lines, respectively, were used in this study, and the trait phenotypes were evaluated in four environments. Unconditional QTL mapping analysis detected 77 additive QTL for four traits in two populations. Of these, 24 QTL were verified in at least three trials, and five of them were major QTL, thus being of great value for marker assisted selection in breeding programmes. Conditional QTL mapping analysis, compared with unconditional QTL mapping analysis, resulted in reduction in the number of QTL for TKW due to the elimination of TKW variations caused by its conditional traits; based on which we first dissected genetic control system involved in the synthetic process between TKW and KD at an individual QTL level. Results indicated that, at the QTL level, KW had the strongest influence on TKW, followed by KL, and KDR had the lowest level contribution to TKW. In addition, the present study proved that it is not all-inclusive to determine genetic relationships of a pairwise QTL for two related/causal traits based on whether they were co-located. Thus, conditional QTL mapping method should be used to evaluate possible genetic relationships of two related/causal traits.</p>

				<title>Mating with large males decreases the immune defence of females in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0427-0434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mating has been widely reported to be a costly event for females. Studies indicate that female cost of mating in terms of fecundity and survivorship can be affected by their mates, leading to antagonistic coevolution between the sexes. However, as of now, there is no evidence that the female cost of mating in terms of immune defence is affected by their mates. We assess the effect of different sized males on antibacterial immune defence and reproductive fitness of their mates. We used a large outbred population of <i>Drososphila melanogaster</i> as the host and <i>Serratia marcescens</i> as the pathogen. We generated three different male phenotypes: small, medium and large, by manipulating larval densities. Compared to females mating with small males, those mating with large males had higher bacterial loads and lower fecundity. There was no significant effect of male phenotype on the fraction of females mated or copulation duration (an indicator of ejaculate investment). Thus, our study is the first clear demonstration that male phenotype can affect the cost of mating to females in terms of their antibacterial immune defence. Mating with large males imposes an additional cost of mating to females in terms of reduced immune defence. The observed results are very likely due to qualitative/quantitative differences in the ejaculates of the three different types of males. If the phenotypic variation that we observed in males in our study is mirrored by genetic variation, then, it can potentially lead to antagonistic coevolution of the sexes over immune defence.</p>

				<title>Eight paths of ERK1/2 signalling pathway regulating hepatocyte proliferation in rat liver regeneration</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0435-0442</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although it is known that hormones, growth factors and integrin promote hepatocyte proliferation in liver regeneration (LR) through ERK1/2 signalling pathway, reports about regulating processes of its intracellular paths in hepatocytes of LR are limited. This study aims at exploring which paths of ERK1/2 signalling pathway participate in the regulation of rat LR, especially in hepatocyte proliferation, and how they do so. In all, 14 paths and 165 genes are known to be involved in ERK1/2 signalling pathway. Of them, 161 genes are included in Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array. This array was used to detect expression changes of genes related to ERK1/2 signalling pathway in isolated hepatocytes of rat LR, showing that 60 genes were related to hepatocytes of LR. In addition, bioinformatics and systems biology methods were used to analyse the roles of 14 above paths in regenerating hepatocytes. We found that three paths, RTK ‚Üí SHC ‚Üí GRB2/SOS ‚Üí RAS ‚Üí RAF, Integrin ùõΩ ‚Üí FAK ‚Üí RAC ‚Üí PAK ‚Üí RAF and G ùõΩ ùõæ ‚Üí PI3K ùõΩ ùõæ ‚Üí RAC ‚Üí PAK ‚Üí RAF, promoted the G<sub>1</sub> phase progression of hepatocytes by activating ERK1/2. A further four paths, Gq ‚Üí PLC ùõΩ ‚Üí PKC ‚Üí SRC/PYK2 ‚Üí GRB2/SOS ‚Üí RAS ‚Üí RAF, RTK ‚Üí PLC ùõæ ‚Üí PKC ‚Üí SRC/PYK2 ‚Üí GRB2/SOS ‚Üí RAS ‚Üí RAF, Integrin ùõΩ ‚Üí FAK/SRC ‚Üí GRB2/SOS ‚Üí RAS ‚Üí RAF and Integrin ùõΩ‚Üí FAK ‚Üí RAC ‚Üí PAK ‚Üí RAF, advanced the cell progression of S phase and G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint by activating ERK1/2, and so did PP1/2 ‚Üí Mek1/2 by decreasing the negative influence on ERK1/2. At the late phase of LR, Gùõºs ‚Üí AC ‚Üí EPAC ‚Üí Rap1 ‚Üí Raf blocked hepatocyte proliferation by decreasing the activity of ERK1/2 and so did PP1/2 ‚Üí Mek1/2. In summary, 60 genes and 8 paths of ERK1/2 signalling pathway regulated hepatocyte proliferation in rat LR.</p>

				<title>Male-limited evolution suggests no extant intralocus sexual conflict over the sexually dimorphic cuticular hydrocarbons of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0443-0452</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sexually dimorphic traits are likely to have evolved through sexually antagonistic selection. However, recent empirical data suggest that intralocus sexual conflict often persists, even when traits have diverged between males and females. This implies that evolved dimorphism is often incomplete in resolving intralocus conflict, providing a mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variance in fitness-related traits. We used experimental evolution in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to directly test for ongoing conflict over a suite of sexually dimorphic cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that are likely targets of sex-specific selection. Using a set of experimental populations in which the transmission of genetic material had been restricted to males for 82 generations, we show that CHCs did not evolve, providing experimental evidence for the absence of current intralocus sexual conflict over these traits. The absence of ongoing conflict could indicate that CHCs have never been the target of sexually antagonistic selection, although this would require the existing dimorphism to have evolved via completely sex-linked mutations or as a result of former, but now absent, pleiotropic effects of the underlying loci on another trait under sexually antagonistic selection. An alternative interpretation, and which we believe to be more likely, is that the extensive CHC sexual dimorphism is the result of past intralocus sexual conflict that has been fully resolved, implying that these traits have evolved genetic independence between the sexes and that genetic variation in them is therefore maintained by alternative mechanisms. This latter interpretation is consistent with the known roles of CHCs in sexual communication in this species and with previous studies suggesting the genetic independence of CHCs between males and females. Nevertheless, direct estimates of sexually antagonistic selection will be important to fully resolve these alternatives.</p>

				<title>The effect of genotyping errors on the robustness of composite linkage disequilibrium measures</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0453-0457</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We conclude that composite linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures be adopted in population-based LD mapping or association mapping studies since it is unaffected by Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg disequilibrium. Although some properties of composite LD measures have been recently studied, the effects of genotyping errors on composite LD measures have not been examined. In this report, we derived deterministic formulas to evaluate the impact of genotyping errors on the composite LD measures $\Delta'_{AB}$ and $r_{AB}$, and compared the robustness of $\Delta'_{AB}$ and $r_{AB}$ in the presence of genotyping errors. The results showed that $\Delta'_{AB}$ and $r_{AB}$ depend on the allele frequencies and the assumed error model, and show varying degrees of robustness in the presence of errors. In general, whether there is HWD or not, $r_{AB}$ is more robust than $\Delta'_{AB}$ except some special cases and the difference of robustness between $\Delta'_{AB}$ and $r_{AB}$ becomes less severe as the difference between the frequencies of two SNP alleles ùê¥ and ùêµ becomes smaller.</p>

				<title>Timing of gene expression from different genetic systems in shaping leucine and isoleucine contents of rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) meal</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0459-0468</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Experiments were conducted on rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) using a diallel design with nine parents: Youcai 601, Double 20-4, Huashuang 3, Gaoyou 605, Zhongyou 821, Eyouchangjia, Zhong R-888, Tower and Zheshuang 72. The seed developmental process was divided into five stages, namely initial (days 1‚Äì15 after flowering), early (days 16‚Äì22 after flowering), middle (days 23‚Äì29), late (days 30‚Äì36), and maturing (days 37‚Äì43) developmental stages. The variation of dynamic genetic effects for leucine and isoleucine contents of rapeseed meal was analysed at five developmental stages, across different environments using the genetic models with time-dependent measures. The results from unconditional and conditional analyses indicated that the expression of diploid embryo, cytoplasmic and diploid maternal plant genes were important for leucine and isoleucine contents at different developmental stages of rapeseed, particularly at the initial and early developmental stages. Among different genetic systems, nutrition quality traits were mainly controlled by the accumulative or net maternal main effects and their GE interaction effects, except at maturity when the net diploid embryo effects were larger. The expression of genes was affected by the environmental conditions on 15, 22, 29 or 36 days after flowering, but was more stable at mature stage. For the isoleucine content the narrow-sense heritabilities on 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 days after flowering were 43.0, 65.7, 60.1, 65.5 and 78.2%, respectively, while for the leucine content the corresponding narrow-sense heritabilities were relatively smaller. The interaction heritabilities were more important than the general heritabilities at the first three developmental times. The improvement for isoleucine content could be achieved by selection based on the higher narrow-sense heritabilities. Various genetic systems exhibited genetic correlations among the developmental times or leucine and isoleucine contents. A simultaneous improvement of leucine and isoleucine contents seems possible because of the significant positive genetic correlation components from different genetic systems at different developmental times.</p>

				<title>The effect of functional compensation among duplicate genes can constrain their evolutionary divergence</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0001-0008</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gene duplicates have the inherent property of initially being functionally redundant. This means that they can compensate for the effect of deleterious variation occurring at one or more sister sites. Here, I present data bearing on evolutionary theory that illustrates the manner in which any functional adaptation in duplicate genes is markedly constrained because of the compensatory utility provided by a sustained genetic redundancy. Specifically, a two-locus epistatic model of paralogous genes was simulated to investigate the degree of purifying selection imposed, and whether this would serve to impede any possible biochemical innovation. Three population sizes were considered to see if, as expected, there was a significant difference in any selection for robustness. Interestingly, physical linkage between tandem duplicates was actually found to increase the probability of any neofunctionalization and the efficacy of selection, contrary to what is expected in the case of singleton genes. The results indicate that an evolutionary trade-off often exists between any functional change under either positive or relaxed selection and the need to compensate for failures due to degenerative mutations, thereby guaranteeing the reliability of protein production.</p>

				<title>Molecular evaluation of genetic diversity and association studies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0009-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we tested rice genotypes that included un(der)exploited landraces of Tamil Nadu along with <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> test cultivars to ascertain their genetic diversity structure. Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were used for generating marker segregation data. A novel measure, allele discrimination index, was used to determine subpopulation differentiation power of each marker. Phenotypic data were collected for yield and component traits. Pattern of molecular differentiation separated <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> genotypes; <i>indica</i> genotypes had two subpopulations within. Landraces were found to have <i>indica</i> genome, but formed a separate subgroup with low linkage disequilibrium. The landraces further separated into distinct group in both hierarchical clustering analysis using neighbour-joining method as well as in the model based population structure analysis. <i>Japonica</i> and the remaining <i>indica</i> cultivars formed two other distinct groups. Linkage disequilibrium observed in the whole population was considerably reduced in subpopulations. Low linkage disequilibrium of landforms suggests their narrow adaptation in local geographical niche. Many population specific alleles could be identified particularly for <i>japonica</i> cultivars and landraces. Association analysis revealed nine marker‚Äìtrait associations with three agronomic traits, of which 67% were previously reported. Although the testing landraces together with known cultivars had permitted genomewide association mapping, the experiment offers scope to study more landraces collected from the entire geographical region for drawing more reliable information.</p>

				<title>Development of SSR markers and construction of a linkage map in jute</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0021-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Jute is an important natural fibre crop, which is only second to cotton in its importance at the global level. It is mostly grown in Indian subcontinent and has been recently used for the development of genomics resources.We recently initiated a programme to develop simple sequence repeat markers and reported a set of 2469 SSR that were developed using four SSR-enriched libraries (Mir <i>et al.</i> 2009). In this communication, we report an additional set of 607 novel SSR in 393 SSR containing sequences. However, primers could be designed for only 417 potentially useful SSR. Polymorphism survey was carried out for 374 primer pairs using two parental genotypes (JRO 524 and PPO4) of a mapping population developed for fibre fineness; only 66 SSR were polymorphic. Owing to a low level of polymorphism between the parental genotypes and a high degree of segregation distortion in recombinant inbred lines, genotypic data of only 53 polymorphic SSR on the mapping population consisting of 120 RIL could be used for the construction of a linkage map; 36 SSR loci were mapped on six linkage groups that covered a total genetic distance of 784.3 cM. Hopefully, this map will be enriched with more SSR loci in future and will prove useful for identification of quantitative trait loci/genes for molecular breeding involving improvement of fibre fineness and other related traits in jute.</p>

				<title>Genetics of flowering time in bread wheat <i>Triticum aestivum</i>: complementary interaction between vernalization-insensitive and photoperiod-insensitive mutations imparts very early flowering habit to spring wheat</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0033-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Time to flowering in the winter growth habit bread wheat is dependent on vernalization (exposure to cold conditions) and exposure to long days (photoperiod). Dominant <i>Vrn-1</i> (<i>Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1</i> and <i>Vrn-D1</i>) alleles are associated with vernalization-independent spring growth habit. The semidominant <i>Ppd-D1a</i> mutation confers photoperiod-insensitivity or rapid flowering in wheat under short day and long day conditions. The objective of this study was to reveal the nature of interaction between <i>Vrn-1</i> and <i>Ppd-D1a</i> mutations (active alleles of the respective genes <i>vrn-1</i> and <i>Ppd-D1b</i>). Twelve Indian spring wheat cultivars and the spring wheat landrace Chinese Spring were characterized for their flowering times by seeding them every month for five years under natural field conditions in New Delhi. Near isogenic <i>Vrn-1 Ppd-D1</i> and <i>Vrn-1 Ppd-D1a</i> lines constructed in two genetic backgrounds were also phenotyped for flowering time by seeding in two different seasons. The wheat lines of <i>Vrn-A1a Vrn-B1 Vrn-D1 Ppd-D1a, Vrn-A1a Vrn-B1 Ppd-D1a and Vrn-A1a Vrn-D1 Ppd-D1a</i> (or <i>Vrn-1 Ppd-D1a</i>) genotypes flowered several weeks earlier than that of <i>Vrn-A1a Vrn-B1 Vrn-D1 Ppd-D1b, Vrn-A1b Ppd-D1b</i> and <i>Vrn-D1 Ppd-D1b</i> (or <i>Vrn-1 Ppd-D1b</i>) genotypes. The flowering time phenotypes of the isogenic vernalization-insensitive lines confirmed that <i>Ppd-D1a</i> hastened flowering by several weeks. It was concluded that complementary interaction between <i>Vrn-1</i> and <i>Ppd-D1a</i> active alleles imparted super/very-early flowering habit to spring wheats. The early and late flowering wheat varieties showed differences in flowering time between short day and long day conditions. The flowering time in <i>Vrn-1 Ppd-D1a</i> genotypes was hastened by higher temperatures under long day conditions. The ambient air temperature and photoperiod parameters for flowering in spring wheat were estimated at 25&#176;C and 12 h, respectively.</p>

				<title>Characterization of variation and quantitative trait loci related to terpenoid indole alkaloid yield in a recombinant inbred line mapping population of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0049-0069</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Improved <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> cultivars are required for high yields of vinblastine, vindoline and catharanthine and/or serpentine and ajmalicine, the pharmaceutical terpenoid indole alkaloids. An approach to derive them is to map QTL for terpenoid indole alkaloids yields, identify DNA markers tightly linked to the QTL and apply marker assisted selection. Towards the end, 197 recombinant inbred lines from a cross were grown over two seasons to characterize variability for seven biomass and 23 terpenoid indole alkaloids content-traits and yield-traits. The recombinant inbred lines were genotyped for 178 DNA markers which formed a framework genetic map of eight linkage groups (LG), spanning 1786.5 cM, with 10.0 cM average intermarker distance. Estimates of correlations between traits allowed selection of seven relatively more important traits for terpenoid indole alkaloids yields. QTL analysis was performed on them using single marker (regression) analysis, simple interval mapping and composite interval mapping procedures. A total of 20 QTL were detected on five of eight LG, 10 for five traits on LG1, five for four traits on LG2, three for one trait on LG3 and one each for different traits on LG three and four. QTL for the same or different traits were found clustered on three LG. Co-location of two QTL for biomass traits was in accord of correlation between them. The QTL were validated for use in marker assisted selection by the recombinant inbred line which transgressively expressed 16 traits contributory to the yield vinblastine, vindoline and catharanthine from leaves and roots that possessed favourable alleles of 13 relevant QTL.</p>

				<title>Multiparent intercross populations in analysis of quantitative traits</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0111-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most traits of interest to medical, agricultural and animal scientists show continuous variation and complex mode of inheritance. DNA-based markers are being deployed to analyse such complex traits, that are known as quantitative trait loci (QTL). In conventional QTL analysis, F2, backcross populations, recombinant inbred lines, backcross inbred lines and double haploids from biparental crosses are commonly used. Introgression lines and near isogenic lines are also being used for QTL analysis. However, such populations have major limitations like predominantly relying on the recombination events taking place in the F<sub>1</sub> generation and mapping of only the allelic pairs present in the two parents. The second generation mapping resources like association mapping, nested association mapping and multiparent intercross populations potentially address the major limitations of available mapping resources. The potential of multiparent intercross populations in gene mapping has been discussed here. In such populations both linkage and association analysis can be conductted without encountering the limitations of structured populations. In such populations, larger genetic variation in the germplasm is accessed and various allelic and cytoplasmic interactions are assessed. For all practical purposes, across crop species, use of eight founders and a fixed population of 1000 individuals are most appropriate. Limitations with multiparent intercross populations are that they require longer time and more resource to be generated and they are likely to show extensive segregation for developmental traits, limiting their use in the analysis of complex traits. However, multiparent intercross population resources are likely to bring a paradigm shift towards QTL analysis in plant species.</p>

				<title>Genomic dissection and prioritizing of candidate genes of QTL for regulating spontaneous arthritis on chromosome 1 in mice deficient for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0119-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous disease with clinical and biological polymorphisms. IL-1RN is a protein that binds to interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors and inhibits the binding of IL-1-alpha and IL-1-beta. IL-1RN levels are elevated in the blood of patients with a variety of infectious, immune, and traumatic conditions. Balb/c mice deficient in IL-1ra (mouse gene of IL-1RN) develop spontaneous autoimmune arthritis while DBA/1 mice deficient in IL-1ra do not. Previously, we identified a major QTL that regulates the susceptibility to arthritis in Balb/c mice with IL-1ra deficiency. In this study, we found that the QTL may contain two peaks that are regulated by two sets of candidate genes. By haplotype analysis, the total genomic regions of candidate genes were reduced from about 19 Mbp to approximately 9 Mbp. The total number of candidate genes was reduced from 208 to 21.</p>

				<title>The evolution and utility of ribosomal ITS sequences in Bambusinae and related species: divergence, pseudogenes, and implications for phylogeny</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0129-0139</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences are commonly used for phylogenetic reconstruction because they are highly reiterated as components of rDNA repeats, and hence are often subject to rapid homogenization through concerted evolution. Concerted evolution leads to intragenomic uniformity of repeats even between loci on nonhomologous chromosomes. However, a number of studies have shown that the ITS polymorphism within individuals is quite common. The molecular systematics of Bambusinae and related species were recently assessed by different teams using independently generated ITS sequences, and the results disagreed in some remarkable features. Here we compared the ITS sequences of the members of <i>Bambusa</i> s. l., the genera <i>Dendrocalamus, Dinochloa, Gigantochloa, Guadua, Melocalamus, Monocladus, Oxytenanthera, Thyrsostachys, Pleioblastus, Pseudosasa</i> and <i>Schizostachyum</i>. We have reanalysed the ITS sequences used by different research teams to reveal the underlying patterns of their different results. After excluding the sequences suspected to represent paralogous loci, a phylogenetic analysis of the subtribe Bambusinae species were performed using maximum parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods. The implications of the findings are discussed. The risk of incorporating ITS paralogues in plant evolutionary studies that can distort the phylogenetic signal should caution molecular systematists.</p>

				<title>The mitochondrial genome of the quiet-calling katydids, <i>Xizicus fascipes</i> (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae: Meconematinae)</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>To help determine whether the typical arthropod arrangement was a synapomorphy for the whole Tettigoniidae, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the quiet-calling katydids, <i>Xizicus fascipes</i> (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae: Meconematinae). The 16,166-bp nucleotide sequences of <i>X. fascipes</i> mitogenome contains the typical gene content, gene order, base composition, and codon usage found in arthropod mitogenomes. As a whole, the <i>X. fascipes</i> mitogenome contains a lower A+T content (70.2%) found in the complete orthopteran mitogenomes determined to date. All protein-coding genes started with a typical ATN codon. Ten of the 13 protein-coding genes have a complete termination codon, but the remaining three genes (<i>COIII, ND5</i> and <i>ND4</i>) terminate with incomplete T. All tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structure of mitogenome tRNA, except for <i>tRNA</i>$^{Ser(AGN)}$, in which lengthened anticodon stem (9 bp) with a bulged nuleotide in the middle, an unusual T-stem (6 bp in constrast to the normal 5 bp), a mini DHU arm (2 bp) and no connector nucleotides. In the A+T-rich region, two (TA)n conserved blocks that were previously described in Ensifera and two 150-bp tandem repeats plus a partial copy of the composed at 61 bp of the beginning were present.

				<title>Introgression of a leaf rust resistance gene from <i>Aegilops caudata</i> to bread wheat</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0155-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rusts are the most important biotic constraints limiting wheat productivity worldwide. Deployment of cultivars with broad spectrum rust resistance is the only environmentally viable option to combat these diseases. Identification and introgression of novel sources of resistance is a continuous process to combat the ever evolving pathogens. The germplasm of nonprogenitor <i>Aegilops</i> species with substantial amount of variability has been exploited to a limited extent. In the present investigation introgression, inheritance and molecular mapping of a leaf rust resistance gene of <i>Ae. caudata</i> (CC) acc. pau3556 in cultivated wheat were undertaken. An F<sub>2</sub> population derived from the cross of <i>Triticum aestivum</i> cv.WL711 ‚Äì <i>Ae. caudata</i> introgression line T291-2 with wheat cultivar PBW343 segregated for a single dominant leaf rust resistance gene at the seedling and adult plant stages. Progeny testing in F<sub>3</sub> confirmed the introgression of a single gene for leaf rust resistance. Bulked segregant analysis using polymorphic D-genome-specific SSR markers and the cosegregation of the 5DS anchored markers (<i>Xcfd18, Xcfd78, Xfd81</i> and <i>Xcfd189</i>) with the rust resistance in the F<sub>2</sub> population mapped the leaf rust resistance gene (<i>LrAC</i>) on the short arm of wheat chromosome 5D. Genetic complementation and the linked molecular markers revealed that <i>LrAC</i> is a novel homoeoallele of an orthologue <i>Lr57</i> already introgressed from the 5M chromosome of <i>Ae. geniculata</i> on 5DS of wheat.</p>

				<title>Comparative mapping reveals similar linkage of functional genes to QTL of yield-related traits between <i>Brassica napus</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i></title>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Oryza sativa</i> and <i>Brassica napus</i>‚Äîtwo important crops for food and oil, respectively‚Äîshare high seed yield as a common breeding goal. As a model plant, <i>O. sativa</i> genomics have been intensively investigated and its agronomic traits have been advanced. In the present study, we used the available information on <i>O. sativa</i> to conduct comparative mapping between <i>O. sativa</i> and <i>B. napus</i>, with the aim of advancing research on seed-yield and yield-related traits in <i>B. napus</i>. Firstly, functional markers (from 55 differentially expressed genes between a hybrid and its parents) were used to detect <i>B. napus</i> genes that co-localized with yield-related traits in an F<sub>2‚à∂3</sub> population. Referring to publicly available sequences of 55 <i>B. napus</i> genes, 53 homologous <i>O. sativa</i> genes were subsequently detected by screening, and their chromosomal locations were determined using silico mapping. Comparative location of yield-related QTL between the two species showed that a total of 37 <i>O. sativa</i> and <i>B. napus</i> homologues were located in similar yield-related QTL between species. Our results indicate that homologous genes between <i>O. sativa</i> and <i>B. napus</i> may have consistent function and control similar traits, which may be helpful for agronomic gene characterization in <i>B. napus</i> based on what is known in <i>O. sativa.</i></p>

				<title>A microRNA signature associated with chondrogenic lineage commitment</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0171-0182</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Generating appropriate cartilage for clinical applications to heal skeletal tissue loss is a major health concern. In this regard, cell-based approaches offer a potential therapeutic strategy for cartilage repair, although little is known about the precise mechanism of chondrogenesis. Unrestricted somatic stem cell (USSC) is considered as a suitable candidate because of its potential for differentiating into multiple cell types. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in several biological processes including development and differentiation. To identify the chondro-specific miRNA signature, miRNA patterns of USSCs and differentiated chondrocytes were investigated using microarrays and validation by qPCR. Prior to these analyses, chondrogenic commitment of differentiated USSCs was verified by immunocytochemistry, specific staining and evaluation of some main chondrogenic marker genes. Various <i>in silico</i> explorations (for both putative targets and signalling pathways) and empirical analyses (miRNA transfections followed by qPCR of some chondrogenic indicators) were carried out to support our results. Transient modulation of multiple chondro-miRs (such as mir-630, mir-624 and mir-376) with chondrocyte targets (such as TGFbR, MAP3K, collagens, SMADs and cadherins) as mediators of chondrogenic signalling pathways including cell‚Äìcell interactions, TGF-beta, and MAPK signalling suggests a mechanism for genetic induction of chondrogenic differentiation. In conclusion, this research reveals more details about the allocation of USSCs into the chondrocytes through identification of miRNA signature which modulates targets and pathways required for chondrogenic lineage and could provide guidelines for future clinical treatments and anti-miRNA therapies.</p>

				<title>Genetic structure of a novel biofuel-producing microorganism community</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0183-0191</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biofuels are an important alternative, renewable source of energy in the face of the ongoing depletion of fossil fuels. Cheese whey is a dairy industry waste characterized by high lactose concentration, which represents a significant environmental problem. Bio-ethanol production by cheese whey could be an effective nonvegetable source for renewable energy production. Here, we report the isolation of a mixed microbial population, able to produce ethanol as main fermentation product from fermenting whey. The microbial consortium has been used to perform a batch fermentation of crude whey in both anoxic and hypoxic conditions. Maximum ethanol concentrations achieved in this study was obtained using the mixed culture in hypoxic conditions, grown at pH 4 and 30&#176;C, with ethanol production yield of 60 g/L. Our research has pointed out an alternative way to both dispose and valorize cheese whey, a dairy by-product that could cause water pollution and harm to the environment if not properly treated.</p>

				<title>Marker-assisted selection of highmolecular weight glutenin alleles related to bread-making quality in Iranian common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0193-0198</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Bread-making quality in hexaploid wheats is a complex trait. It has been shown that the amount and composition of protein can influence dough rheological properties. The high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenins are encoded by a complex locus, <i>Glu-1</i>, on the long arm of group-1 homoeologus chromosome of the A, B and D genomes. In this work we used PCR-based DNA markers as a substitution tool to distinguish wheat bread-making quality. We detected PCR-based DNA markers for coding sequence of <i>Glu-A1x, Glu-B1x</i> and <i>Glu-D1x</i> to be 2300 bp, 2400 bp and 2500 bp respectively. DNA markers related to coding sequence of <i>Glu-A1y, Glu-B1y</i> and <i>Glu-D1y</i> were; 1800 bp, 2100 bp and 1950 bp, however, the repetitive region of their coding sequence were shown to be about 1300 bp, 1500 bp and 1600 bp. The results demonstrate that the size variation was due to different lengths of the central repetitive domain. Good or poor bread-making quality in wheat is associated with two allelic pairs of <i>Glu-D1</i>, designated <i>1Dx5-1Dy10</i> and <i>IDx2-1Dy12</i>. The <i>1Bx7</i> allele has moderate-to-good quality score. The specific DNA markers, of 450 bp, 576 bp, 612 bp and 2400 bp respectively were characterized for <i>1Dx5, 1Dy10, 1Dy12</i> and <i>1Bx7</i> alleles. These markers are very important in screening of wheat for bread-making quality.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>ad-8</i> gene of <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, in addition to being used for the study of purine biology, has been extensively studied as a model for gene structure, mutagenesis and intralocus recombination. Because of this there is an extensive collection of well-characterized <i>N. crassa ad-8</i> mutants in the Fungal Genetics Stock Center collection. Among these are spontaneous mutants and mutants induced with X-ray, UV or chemical mutagens. The specific lesions in these mutants have been genetically mapped at high resolution. We have sequenced the <i>ad-8</i> locus from 13 of these mutants and identified the molecular nature of the mutation in each strain. We compare the historical fine-structure map to the DNA and amino acid sequence of each allele. The placement of the individual lesions in the fine-structure map was more accurate at the 5&#8242; end of the gene and no mutants were identified in the 3&#8242; untranslated region of this gene. We additionally analysed <i>ad-8<sup>+</sup></i> alleles in 18 <i>N. crassa</i> strains subjected to whole-genome sequence analysis and describe the variability among <i>Neurospora</i> strains and among fungi and other organisms.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Trichotillomania (TTM), an obsessive‚Äìcompulsive spectrum disorder (OCSD), is a psychiatric condition characterized by repetitive hair pulling. Evidence from family and twin studies suggest a heritable link of TTM. Functional polymorphisms in genes involved in neuronal pathways might influence the susceptibility to TTM. This review is an attempt to compile the genetic factors reported to modify the development of TTM.</p>

				<title>Genetic and morphological variability in South American rodent <i>Oecomys</i> (Sigmodontinae, Rodentia): evidence for a complex of species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0265-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The rodent genus <i>Oecomys</i> (Sigmodontinae) comprises &#8764;16 species that inhabit tropical and subtropical forests in Central America and South America. In this study specimens of <i>Oecomys paricola</i> Thomas, 1904 from Bel√©m and Maraj√≥ island, northern Brazil, were investigated using cytogenetic, molecular and morphological analyses. Three karyotypes were found, two from Bel√©m ($2n = 68$, fundamental number (FN) = 72 and $2n = 70$, FN = 76) and a third from Maraj√≥ island ($2n = 70$, FN = 72). No molecular or morphological differences were found between the individuals with differing cytotypes from Bel√©m, but differences were evident between the individuals from Bel√©m and Maraj√≥ island. Specimens from Bel√©m city region may represent two cryptic species because two different karyotypes are present in the absence of significant differences in morphology and molecular characteristics. The Maraj√≥ island and Bel√©m populations may represent distinct species that have been separated for some time, and are in the process of morphological and molecular differentiation as a consequence of reproductive isolation at the geographic and chromosomal levels. Thus, the results suggest that <i>O. paricola</i> may be a complex of species.</p>

					<p>Lentil (<i>Lens culinaris</i> ssp. <i>culinaris</i>), is a self-pollinating diploid ($2n = 2x = 14$), cool-season legume crop and is consumed worldwide as a rich source of protein (&#8764;24.0%), largely in vegetarian diets. Here we report development of a genetic linkage map of <i>Lens</i> using 114 F<sub>2</sub> plants derived from the intersubspecific cross between L 830 and ILWL 77. RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) primers revealed more polymorphism than ISSR (intersimple sequence repeat) and SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers. The highest proportion (30.72%) of segregation distortion was observed in RAPD markers. Of the 235 markers (34 SSR, 9 ISSR and 192 RAPD) used in the mapping study, 199 (28 SSRs, 9 ISSRs and 162 RAPDs) were mapped into 11 linkage groups (LGs), varying between 17.3 and 433.8 cM and covering 3843.4 cM, with an average marker spacing of 19.3 cM. Linkage analysis revealed nine major groups with 15 or more markers each and two small LGs with two markers each, and 36 unlinked markers. The study reported assigning of 11 new SSRs on the linkage map. Of the 66 markers with aberrant segregation, 14 were unlinked and the remaining 52 were mapped. ISSR and RAPD markers were found to be useful in map construction and saturation. The current map represents maximum coverage of lentil genome and could be used for identification of QTL regions linked to agronomic traits, and for marker-assisted selection in lentil.</p>

				<title>Mapping of quantitative trait loci for oil content in cottonseed kernel</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0289-0295</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Oil content in cottonseed is a major quality trait which when improved through breeding could enhance the competitiveness of cottonseed oil among other vegetable oils. Cottonseed oil content is a quantitative trait controlled by genes in the tetraploid embryo and tetraploid maternal plant genomes, and the knowledge of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and the genetic effects related to oil content in both genomes could facilitate the improvement in its quality and quantity. However, till date, QTL mapping and genetic analysis related to this trait in cotton have only been conducted in the tetraploid embryo genome. In the current experiment, an IF<sub>2</sub> population of cottonseed kernels from the random crossing of 188 intraspecific recombinant inbred lines which were derived from the hybrid of two parents, HS46 and MARCABUCAG8US-1-88, were used to simultaneously locate QTLs for oil content in the embryo and maternal plant genomes. The four QTLs found to be associated with oil content in cottonseed were: <i>qOC-18-1</i> on chromosome 18; <i>qOC-LG-11</i> on linkage group 11; <i>qOC-18-2</i> on chromosome 18; and <i>qOC-22</i> on chromosome 22. At a high selection threshold of 0.05, there was strong evidence linking the QTLs above the oil content in cottonseed. Embryo additive and dominant effects from the tetraploid embryo genome, as well as maternal additive effects from the tetraploid maternal plant genome were found to be significant contributors to genetic variation in cottonseed oil content.</p>

				<title>Y-SNP haplogroups related to the Yqh+ heteromorphism in the Mexican northwestern population</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0297-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Morphological variation of the Y chromosome has been observed in different populations. This variation is mostly related to the heteromorphic Yq12 band, which is composed of a variable block of constitutive heterochromatin. The Yqh+ heteromorphism has a worldwide frequency of 2.85% and is considered clinically innocuous. The aim of this study was to identify the ancestry of the Yqh+ heteromorphism present in individuals from western Mexico. For this purpose, 17 Y-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms were analysed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and SNaPshot assays. In 28 Yqh+ males, only five haplogroups were observed; with a haplogroup diversity of 0.4841 ¬± 0.1094, which was less than that observed in a study of unselected Mexican mestizo population. Differences were specifically conferred by the high frequencies of haplogroups R1b1 and P<sup>*</sup>(xQ,R), and by the absence of the Amerindian haplogroup Q (Q<sup>*</sup>(xQ1a3a) plus Q1a3a) from the Yqh+ group. This study suggests a post-1492 incorporation for Yqh+ chromosomes into the Mexican northwestern population.</p>

				<title>Conditional QTL mapping of protein content in wheat with respect to grain yield and its components</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0303-0312</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Grain protein content in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) is generally considered a highly heritable character that is negatively correlated with grain yield and yield-related traits. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for protein content was mapped using data on protein content and protein content conditioned on the putatively interrelated traits to evaluate possible genetic interrelationships between protein content and yield, as well as yield-related traits. Phenotypic data were evaluated in a recombinant inbred line population with 302 lines derived from a cross between the Chinese cultivar Weimai 8 and Luohan 2. Inclusive composite interval mapping using IciMapping 3.0 was employed for mapping unconditional and conditional QTL with additives. A strong genetic relationship was found between protein content and grain yield, and yield-related traits. Unconditional QTL mapping analysis detected seven additive QTL for protein content, with additive effects ranging in absolute size from 0.1898% to 0.3407% protein content, jointly accounting for 43.45% of the trait variance. Conditional QTL mapping analysis indicated two QTL independent from yield, which can be used in marker-assisted selection for increasing yield without affecting grain protein content. Three additional QTL with minor effects were identified in the conditional mapping. Of the three QTLs, two were identified when protein content was conditioned on yield, which had pleiotropic effects on those two traits. Conditional QTL mapping can be used to dissect the genetic interrelationship between two traits at the individual QTL level for closely correlated traits. Further, conditional QTL mapping can reveal additional QTL with minor effects that are undetectable in unconditional mapping.</p>

				<title>Genomewide analysis of intronic microRNAs in rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0313-0324</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potent regulators of gene transcription and posttranscriptional processes. The majority of miRNAs are localized within intronic regions of protein-coding genes (host genes) and have diverse functions in regulating important cellular processes in animals. To date, few plant intronic miRNAs have been studied functionally. Here we report a comprehensive computational analysis to characterize intronic miRNAs in rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the identified intronic miRNAs were derived from the real introns of host genes. Interestingly, 13 intronic miRNAs in rice and two in <i>Arabidopsis</i> were located within seven clusters, of which four polycistronic clusters contain miRNAs derived from different families, suggesting that these clustered intronic miRNAs might be involved in extremely complex regulation in rice. Length analysis of miRNA-carrying introns, promoter prediction and qRT-PCR analysis results indicated that intronic miRNAs are coexpressed with their host genes. Expression pattern analysis demonstrated that host genes had a very broad expression spectrum in different stages of development, suggesting the intronic miRNAs might play an important role in plant development. This comparative genomics analysis of intronic miRNAs in rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides new insight into the functions and regulatory mechanisms of intronic miRNAs in monocots and dicots.</p>

				<title>Genetic interaction and mapping studies on the <i>leaflet development</i> (<i>lld</i>) mutant in <i>Pisum sativum</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0325-0342</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Pisum sativum</i>, the completely penetrant <i>leaflet development</i> (<i>lld</i>) mutation is known to sporadically abort pinnae suborgans in the unipinnate compound leaf. Here, the frequency and morphology of abortion was studied in each of the leaf suborgans in 36 genotypes and in presence of auxin and gibberellin, and their antagonists. Various <i>lld</i> genotypes were constructed by multifariously recombining <i>lld</i> with a <i>coch</i> homeotic stipule mutation and with <i>af, ins, mare, mfp, tl</i> and <i>uni-tac</i> leaf morphology mutations. It was observed that the suborgans at all levels of pinna subdivisions underwent <i>lld</i>-led abortion events at different stages of development. As in leafblades, <i>lld</i> aborted the pinnae in leaf-like compound <i>coch</i> stipules. The <i>lld</i> mutation interacted with <i>mfp</i> synergistically and with other leaf mutations additively. The rod-shaped and trumpet-shaped aborted pea leaf suborgans mimicked the phenotype of aborted leaves in HD-ZIP-III-deficient <i>Arabidopsis thaliana mutants</i>. Suborganwise aborted morphologies in <i>lld</i> gnotypes were in agreement with basipetal differentiation of leaflets and acropetal differentiation in tendrils. Altogether, the observations suggested that <i>LLD</i> was the master regulator of pinna development. On the basis of molecular markers found linked to <i>lld</i>, its locus was positioned on the linkage group III of the <i>P. sativum</i> genetic map.</p>

				<title>Genetic features of thyroid hormone receptors</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0367-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Thyroid hormone receptors (TR) are prototypes of nuclear transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes. These receptors play an important role in many physiological processes. Moreover, a dysfunction of these proteins is often implicated in several human diseases and malignancies. Here we report genetic variations and alterations of the TRs that have been described in the literature as well as their potential role in the development of some human diseases including cancers. The functional effects of some mutations and polymorphisms in TRs on disease susceptibility, especially on cancer risk, are now established. Therefore, further investigations are needed in order to use these receptors as therapeutic targets or as biological markers to decide on appropriate forms of treatment.</p>

				<title>Polymorphisms in human DNA repair genes and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0375-0384</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic polymorphisms in some DNA repair proteins are associated with a number of malignant transformations like head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Xeroderma pigmentosum group D (<i>XPD</i>) and X-ray repair cross-complementing proteins 1 (<i>XRCC1</i>) and 3 (<i>XRCC3</i>) genes are involved in DNA repair and were found to be associated with HNSCC in numerous studies. To establish our overall understanding of possible relationships between DNA repair gene polymorphisms and development of HNSCC, we surveyed the literature on epidemiological studies that assessed potential associations with HNSCC risk in terms of gene‚Äìenvironment interactions, genotype-induced functional defects in enzyme activity and/or protein expression, and the influence of ethnic origin on these associations.We conclude that large, well-designed studies of common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are needed. Such studies may benefit from analysis of multiple genes or polymorphisms and from the consideration of relevant exposures that may influence the likelihood of HNSCC when DNA repair capacity is reduced.</p>

				<title>DREB1/CBF transcription factors: their structure, function and role in abiotic stress tolerance in plants</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0385-0395</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Drought, high salinity and low temperature are major abiotic stresses that influence survival, productivity and geographical distribution of many important crops across the globe. Plants respond to these environmental challenges via physiological, cellular and molecular processes, which results in adjusted metabolic and structural alterations. The dehydration-responsive-element-binding (DREB) protein / C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) belong to APETALA2 (AP2) family transcription factors that bind to DRE/CRT <i>cis</i>-element and regulate the expression of stress-responsive genes. <i>DREB1/CBF</i> genes, therefore, play an important role in increasing stress tolerance in plants and their deployment using transgenic technology seems to be a potential alternative in management of abiotic stresses in crop plants. This review is mainly focussed on the structural characteristics as well as transcriptional regulation of gene expression in response to various abiotic stresses, with particular emphasis on the role of <i>DREB1/CBF</i> regulon in stress-responsive gene expression. The recent progress related to genetic engineering of <i>DREB1/CBF</i> transcription factors in various crops and model plants is also summarized.</p>

				<title>The potential significance of binovular follicles and binucleate giant oocytes for the development of genetic abnormalities</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0397-0404</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Normal development of a fertilizable female gamete emanates from a follicle containing only one oocyte that becomes haploid after first meiotic division. Binovular follicles including two oocytes and binucleate giant oocytes that are diploid after first meiosis constitute notable exceptions from this rule. Data provided by programmes of human-assisted reproduction on the occurrence of both phenomena have been reviewed to evaluate possible implications for the formation of genetic abnormalities. To exclude confusion with oocytes aspirated from two adjacent individual follicles, true binovularity has been defined as inclusion of two oocytes within a common zona pellucida or their fusion in the zonal region. A total of 18 conjoined oocytes have been reported and one of the oocyte was normally fertilized in seven cases. Simultaneous fertilization of both female gametes occurred only once. No pregnancy was achieved after transfer of an embryo from a binovular follicle. Binucleate giant oocytes have been observed sporadically but a few reports suggest an incidence of up to 0.3% of all gametes retrieved. Extensive studies performed by two independent centres demonstrated that giant oocytes are diploid at metaphase II, can undergo fertilization in vitro with formation of two or three pronuclei and develop into triploid zygotes and triploid or triploid/mosaic embryos. In summary, giant binucleate oocytes may be responsible for the development of digynic triploidy whereas the currently available data do not support a role of conjoined oocytes in producing dizygotic twins, mosaicism, chimaeras or tetraploidy. However, more information on the maturity and fertilizability of oocytes from binovular follicles is needed. Future studies should also evaluate a possible impact of pharmaceutical and environmental oestrogens on the formation of multiovular follicles.</p>

				<title>Estimation of <i>in situ</i> mating systems in wild sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench) in Ethiopia using SSR-based progeny array data: implications for the spread of crop genes into the wild</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0003-0010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Because transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> L.) is being developed for Africa, we investigated the potential for transgenes to spread to conspecific wild/weedy sorghum populations in Ethiopia, which is considered the centre of origin of cultivated sorghum. In the current study, the extent of outcrossing, and uniparental and biparental inbreeding were investigated in seven wild/weedy sorghum populations collected at elevations ranging from 631 to 1709 m. Based on allele frequency data of 1120 progenies and 140 maternal plants from five polymorphic microsatellite markers, outcrossing rates were estimated using standard procedures. The average multilocus outcrossing rate was 0.51, with a range of 0.31‚Äì0.65 among populations, and the family outcrossing rate was in the extreme range of 0 to 100%. The highest outcrossing ($t_{m} = 0.65$) was recorded in a weedy population that was intermixed with an improved crop variety in Abuare (Wello region). It was also observed that the inbreeding coefficient of the progenies ($F_{\text{p}}$) tend to be more than the inbreeding coefficient of both their maternal parents ($F_{\text{m}}$) and the level of inbreeding expected at equilibrium ($F_{\text{eq}}$), which is a characteristic of predominantly outbreeding species. Biparental inbreeding was evident in all populations and averaged 0.24 (range = 0.10‚Äì0.33). The high outcrossing rates of wild/weedy sorghum populations in Ethiopia indicate a high potential for crop genes (including transgenes) to spread within the wild pool. Therefore, effective risk management strategies may be needed if the introgression of transgenes or other crop genes from improved cultivars into wild or weedy populations is deemed to be undesirable.</p>

				<title>Molecular adaptation within the coat protein-encoding gene of Tunisian almond isolates of <i>Prunus</i> necrotic ringspot virus</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0011-0024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The sequence alignments of five Tunisian isolates of <i>Prunus</i> necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV) were searched for evidence of recombination and diversifying selection. Since failing to account for recombination can elevate the false positive error rate in positive selection inference, a genetic algorithm (GARD) was used first and led to the detection of potential recombination events in the coat protein-encoding gene of that virus. The Recco algorithm confirmed these results by identifying, additionally, the potential recombinants. For neutrality testing and evaluation of nucleotide polymorphism in PNRSV CP gene, Tajima‚Äôs ùê∑, and Fu and Li‚Äôs ùê∑ and ùêπ statistical tests were used. About selection inference, eight algorithms (SLAC, FEL, IFEL, REL, FUBAR, MEME, PARRIS, and GA branch) incorporated in HyPhy package were utilized to assess the selection pressure exerted on the expression of PNRSV capsid. Inferred phylogenies pointed out, in addition to the three classical groups (PE-5, PV-32, and PV-96), the delineation of a fourth cluster having the new proposed designation SW6, and a fifth clade comprising four Tunisian PNRSV isolates which underwent recombination and selective pressure and to which the name Tunisian outgroup was allocated.</p>

				<title>Auxin transport inhibitor induced low complexity petiolated leaves and sessile leaf-like stipules and architectures of heritable leaf and stipule mutants in <i>Pisum sativum</i> suggest that its simple lobed stipules and compound leaf represent ancestral forms in angiosperms</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0025-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In angiosperms, leaf and stipule architectures are inherited species-specific traits. Variation in leaf and stipule sizes, and forms result from the interaction between abiotic and biotic stimuli, and gene regulatory network(s) that underlie the leaf and stipule developmental programme(s). Here, correspondence between variation in leaf and stipule architectures described for extant angiosperms and that induced mutationally and by imposition of stress in model angiosperm species, especially in <i>Pisum sativum</i>, was detected. Following inferences were drawn from the observations.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Several leaf forms in <i>P. sativum</i> have origin in fusion of stipule and leaf primordia. Perfoliate (and amplexicaul and connate) simple sessile leaves and sessile adnate leaves are the result of such primordial fusions. Reversal of changes in the gene regulatory network responsible for fusion products are thought to restore original stipule and leaf conditions.</li>
						<li>Compound leaf formation in several different model plants, is a result of promotion of pathways for such condition by gene regulatory networks directed by <i>KNOX1</i> and <i>LEAFY</i> transcription factors or intercalation of the gene networks directed by them.</li>
						<li>Gene regulatory network for compound leaves in <i>P. sativum</i> when mutated generates highly complex compound leaves on one hand and simple leaves on other hand. These altered conditions are mutationally reversible.</li>
						<li>Simple leaves in model plants such as <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> despite overexpression of <i>KNOX1</i> orthologues do not become compound.</li>
						<li>All forms of leaves, including simple leaf, probably have origins in a gene regulatory network of the kind present in <i>P. sativum.</i></li>

				<title>Functional analysis of a <i>Lemna gibba rbcS</i> promoter regulated by abscisic acid and sugar</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0063-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs) are able to respond to multiple environmental and developmental signals, including light, sugar and abscisic acid (ABA). PhANGs have been extensively studied at the level of transcriptional regulation, and several <i>cis</i>-acting elements important for light responsiveness have been identified in their promoter sequences. However, the regulatory elements involved in sugar and ABA regulation of PhANGs have not been completely characterized. A ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene (<i>rbcS</i>) promoter (<i>SSU5C</i> promoter) was isolated from duckweed (<i>Lemna gibba</i>). A series of <i>SSU5C</i> promoter 5&#8242; deletion fragments were fused to an intron‚Äì<i>gus</i> gene, and transgenic tobacco suspension cell lines were generated. Assay of tobacco suspension cell line harbouring the complete promoter in the fusion construct indicated that <i>SSU5C</i> promoter was negatively regulated by sugar and ABA under the condition of regular photoperiod. 5&#8242; deletion analysis of <i>SSU5C</i> promoter in transgenic tobacco suspension cell lines confirmed that a region between positions $-310$ and $-152$ included the ABA-response region, and that sugar-response <i>cis</i>-acting elements might be located in the region between $-152$ and $-117$. Taken together, our results confirmed that the <i>cis</i>-regulatory region responsible for repression by ABA and sugar in the <i>SSU5C</i> promoter was located between $-310$ and $-117$.</p>

				<title>Genetic dissection reveals effects of interaction between high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits and waxy alleles on dough-mixing properties in common wheat</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0069-0079</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The glutenin and waxy loci of wheat are important determinants of dough quality. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of high-molecular-weight glutenin (HMW-GS) and waxy alleles on dough-mixing properties. Molecular mapping was used to investigate these effects on Mixograph properties in a population of 290 (Nuomai1 &#215; Gaocheng8901) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from three environments in the harvest years 2008, 2009 and 2011. The results indicated the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the <i>Glu-A1</i> and <i>Glu-D1</i> loci have greater impacts on Mixograph properties compared to the <i>Wx-1</i> loci and the effects of <i>Glu-D1d</i> and <i>Glu-D1h</i> on dough mixing are better than those of <i>Glu-D1f</i> and <i>Glu-D1new1</i> in this population;</li>
						<li>the interactions between the <i>Glu-1</i> and <i>Wx-1</i> loci affected some traits, especially the midline peak value (MPV), and the lack of <i>Wx-B1</i> or <i>Wx-D1</i> led to increased MPV for all types of <i>Glu-1</i> loci; and</li>
						<li>30 quantitative-trait loci (QTL) over nine wheat chromosomes were identified with ICIM analysis based on the genetic map of 498 loci.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Eight major QTL and 16 QTL in the <i>Glu-1</i> loci from the three environments were found. The major QTL clusters were associated with the <i>Glu-1</i> loci, and also were found in two regions on chromosome 3B and one region on chromosome 6A, which is one of the novel chromosome regions influencing dough-mixing strength. The two QTL for MPV are located around <i>Wx-B1</i> on chromosome 4A. <i>QMPT-1D.1</i>, <i>QMPI-1D.1</i> and <i>Q8MW-1D.1</i> were stable in different environments and could potentially be used in molecular marker-assisted breeding.</p>

				<title>Gene duplication as a major force in evolution</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0155-0161</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for acquiring new genes and creating genetic novelty in organisms. Many new gene functions have evolved through gene duplication and it has contributed tremendously to the evolution of developmental programmes in various organisms. Gene duplication can result from unequal crossing over, retroposition or chromosomal (or genome) duplication. Understanding the mechanisms that generate duplicate gene copies and the subsequent dynamics among gene duplicates is vital because these investigations shed light on localized and genomewide aspects of evolutionary forces shaping intra-specific and inter-specific genome contents, evolutionary relationships, and interactions. Based on whole-genome analysis of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, there is compelling evidence that angiosperms underwent two whole-genome duplication events early during their evolutionary history. Recent studies have shown that these events were crucial for creation of many important developmental and regulatory genes found in extant angiosperm genomes. Recent studies also provide strong indications that even yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), with its compact genome, is in fact an ancient tetraploid. Gene duplication can provide new genetic material for mutation, drift and selection to act upon, the result of which is specialized or new gene functions. Without gene duplication the plasticity of a genome or species in adapting to changing environments would be severely limited. Whether a duplicate is retained depends upon its function, its mode of duplication, (i.e. whether it was duplicated during a whole-genome duplication event), the species in which it occurs, and its expression rate. The exaptation of preexisting secondary functions is an important feature in gene evolution, just as it is in morphological evolution.</p>

				<title>Genetic polymorphism in <i>FOXP3</i> gene: imbalance in regulatory T-cell role and development of human diseases</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0163-0171</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>FOXP3</i> gene encodes a transcription factor thought to be important for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). These cells are involved in the regulation of T cell activation and therefore are essential for normal immune homeostasis. Signals from microenvironment have a profound influence on the maintenance or progression of diseases. Thus, Tregs have an important marker protein, FOXP3, though it does not necessarily confer a Treg phenotype when expressed. <i>FOXP3</i> polymorphisms that occur with high frequency in the general populations have been studied in common multifactorial human diseases. Dysfunction of <i>FOXP3</i> gene product could result in lack of Treg cells and subsequently chronically activated CD4+ T cells which express increased levels of several activation markers and cytokines, resulting in some autoimmune diseases. In contrast, high Treg levels have been reported in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and tumour specimens from patients with different types of cancer. The present study discusses the polymorphisms located in intron, exon and promoter regions of <i>FOXP3</i> which have already been investigated by many researchers. <i>FOXP3</i> has received considerable attention in attempts to understand the molecular aspect of Treg cells. Therefore, in the present study, the relationship between genetic polymorphism of <i>FOXP3</i> in Treg-cell role and in disease development are reviewed considering the interactive effect of genetic factors.</p>

				<title>Isolation, characterization and mapping of genes differentially expressed during fibre development between <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> and <i>G. barbadense</i> by cDNA-SRAP</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0175-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> and <i>G. barbadense</i> are two cultivated tetraploid cotton species with differences in fibre quality. The fibre of <i>G. barbadense</i> is longer, stronger and finer than that of <i>G. hirsutum</i>. To isolate genes expressed differently between the two species during fibre development, cDNA-SRAP (sequence-related amplified polymorphism) was applied. This technique was used to analyse genes at different stages of fibre development in <i>G. hirsutum</i> cv. Emian22 and <i>G. barbadense</i> acc. 3-79, the parents of our interspecific mapping population. A total of 4096 SRAP primer combinations were used to screen polymorphism between the DNA of the parents, and 275 highly polymorphic primers were picked out to analyse DNA and RNA from leaves and fibres at different developmental stages of the parents. A total of 168 DNA fragments were isolated from gels and sequenced: 54, 30, 38 and 41 from fibres of 5, 10, 15 and 20 days post-anthesis, respectively, and five from multi stages. To genetically map these sequences, 104 sequence-specific primers were developed and were used to screened polymorphism between the mapping parents. Finally, six markers were mapped on six chromosomes of our backbone interspecific genetic map. This work can give us a primary knowledge of differences in mechanism of fibre development between <i>G. hirsutum</i> and <i>G. barbadense.</i></p>

				<title>Fast evolutionary genetic differentiation during experimental colonizations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0183-0194</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Founder effects during colonization of a novel environment are expected to change the genetic composition of populations, leading to differentiation between the colonizer population and its source population. Another expected outcome is differentiation among populations derived from repeated independent colonizations starting from the same source. We have previously detected significant founder effects affecting rate of laboratory adaptation among <i>Drosophila subobscura</i> laboratory populations derived from the wild. We also showed that during the first generations in the laboratory, considerable genetic differentiation occurs between foundations. The present study deepens that analysis, taking into account the natural sampling hierarchy of six foundations, derived from different locations, different years and from two samples in one of the years. We show that striking stochastic effects occur in the first two generations of laboratory culture, effects that produce immediate differentiation between foundations, independent of the source of origin and despite similarity among all founders. This divergence is probably due to powerful genetic sampling effects during the first few generations of culture in the novel laboratory environment, as a result of a significant drop in $N_{\text{e}}$. Changes in demography as well as high variance in reproductive success in the novel environment may contribute to the low values of $N_{\text{e}}$. This study shows that estimates of genetic differentiation between natural populations may be accurate when based on the initial samples collected in the wild, though considerable genetic differentiation may occur in the very first generations of evolution in a new, confined environment. Rapid and significant evolutionary changes can thus occur during the early generations of a founding event, both in the wild and under domestication, effects of interest for both scientific and conservation purposes.</p>

				<title>Preservation of <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i> genomic fragments in recombinant genotypes improved the fruit quality of tomato</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0195-0203</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Five recombinant inbred lines obtained from the F<sub>2</sub> generation of an interspecific cross between cultivar, Caimanta (Cai, <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) and wild accession, LA722 (P, <i>S. pimpinellifolium</i>) were crossed to obtain the second cycle hybrids (SCH). Eleven fruit quality traits were assessed in evaluating phenotypic variability among genotypes P, Cai, F<sub>1</sub> (Cai &#215; P), five RILs, and 10 SCH. One of the five recombinant inbred lines and three SCH had higher values than P, as the best genotype for shelf life. Sequence-related amplified polymorphism was used as the molecular method for detecting polymorphism among these 18 genotypes. The percentage of polymorphism in RILs and SCH was 61% and 66% respectively. Moreover, some bands detected in P were present in SCH. Several multivariate analyses were performed to find agreement between the phenotypic variability observed for fruit quality traits and the polymorphism obtained from sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers. A general Procrustes analysis estimated that there was a consensus proportion of 75% between phenotypic and molecular data. There was considerable preservation of some bands from the wild genotype, which could increase the variability in fruit quality traits in populations where the genetic diversity is limited.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0205-0212</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Dendrobium</i> is an endangered genus in the orchid family with medicinal and horticultural value. Two preliminary genetic linkage maps were constructed using 90 F<sub>1</sub> progeny individuals derived from an interspecific cross between <i>D. nobile</i> and <i>D. moniliforme</i> (both, $2n = 38$), using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR). A total of 286 RAPD loci and 68 ISSR loci were identified and used for genetic linkage analysis. Maps were constructed by double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy using the software Mapmaker/EXP ver. 3.0, and Kosambi map distances were constructed using a LOD score &#8805;4 and a recombination threshold of 0.4. The resulting frame map of <i>D. nobile</i> was 1474 cM in total length with 116 loci distributed in 15 linkage groups; and the <i>D. moniliforme</i> linkage map had 117 loci placed in 16 linkage groups spanning 1326.5 cM. Both maps showed 76.91% and 73.59% genome coverage for <i>D. nobile</i> and <i>D. moniliforme</i>, respectively. These primary maps provide an important basis for genetic studies and further medicinal and horticultural traits mapping and marker-assisted selection in <i>Dendrobium</i> breeding programmes.</p>

				<title>Conditional and unconditional QTL mapping of drought-tolerance-related traits of wheat seedling using two related RIL populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0213-0231</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For discovering the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contributing to early seedling growth and drought tolerance during germination, conditional and unconditional analyses of 12 traits of wheat seedlings: coleoptile length, seedling height, longest root length, root number, seedling fresh weight, stem and leaves fresh weight, root fresh weight, seedling dry weight, stem and leaves dry weight, root dry weight, root to shoot fresh weight ratio, root-to-shoot dry weight ratio, were conducted under two water conditions using two F<sub>8:9</sub> recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. The results of unconditional analysis are as follows: 88 QTLs accounting for 3.33‚Äì77.01% of the phenotypic variations were detected on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6A, 6B, 6D, 7A, 7B and 7D. Among these QTLs, 19 were main-effect QTLs with a contribution rate greater than 10%. The results of the conditional QTL analysis of 12 traits under osmotic stress on normal water conditions were as follows: altogether 22 QTLs concerned with drought tolerance were detected on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2B, 3B, 4A, 5D, 6A, 6D, 7B, and 7D. Of these QTLs, six were main-effect QTLs. These 22 QTLs were all special loci directly concerned with drought tolerance and most of them could not be detected by unconditional analysis. The finding of these QTLs has an important significance for fine-mapping technique, map-based cloning, and molecular marker-assisted selection of early seedling traits, such as growth and drought tolerance</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have previously reported <i>Xgwm382</i> as a diagnostic marker for disease resistance against yellow rust in Izgi2001 &#215; ES14 F<sub>2</sub> population. Among the same earlier tested 230 primers, one SSR marker (<i>Xgwm311</i>) also amplified a fragment which is present in the resistant parent and in the resistant bulks, but absent in the susceptible parent and in the susceptible bulks. To understand the chromosome group location of these diagnostic markers, <i>Xgwm382</i> and <i>Xgwm311</i>, in the same population, we selected 16 SSR markers mapped only in one genome of chromosome group 2 around 1‚Äì21 cM distance to these diagnostic markers based on the SSR consensus map of wheat. Out of 16 SSRs, <i>Xwmc658</i> identified resistant F<sub>2</sub> individuals as a diagnostic marker for yellow rust disease and provided the location of <i>Xgwm382</i> and <i>Xgwm311</i> on chromosome 2AL in our plant material.</p>

				<title>Quality of synthetic hexaploid wheat containing null alleles at <i>Glu-A1</i> and <i>Glu-B1</i> loci</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0241-0245</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Triticum turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccon</i> PI94668 and PI349045 were identified as containing null alleles at <i>Glu-A1</i> and <i>Glu-B1</i> loci in previous investigation. Sequencing of the respective HMW-GS genes <i>Ax, Bx, Ay</i> and <i>By</i> in both accessions indicated equal DNA lengths with gene silencing caused by 1 to 4 in-frame stop codon(s) in the open reading frames. Six synthetic hexaploid wheat lines were produced by crossing PI94668 or PI349045 with six <i>Aegilops tauschii</i> by spontaneous chromosome doubling of unreduced gametes. As expected, these amphiploids had three different HMW-GS: Dx 3.1<sup>t</sup> + Dy11<sup>*t</sup>, Dx2.1<sup>t</sup> +10<sup>t</sup> and Dx2<sup>t</sup> + Dy12<sup>t</sup> in <i>Glu-D1</i> but double nulls in <i>Glu-A1</i> and <i>Glu-B1</i>. Quality tests showed that most quality parameters in two <i>T. turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccon</i> parents were very low due to the lack of HMW-GSs. However, incorporation of HMW-GS from <i>Ae. tauschii</i> in six synthetic hexaploid wheat lines significantly increased most quality related parameters. The potential values of these wheat lines in improving the quality of wheat are discussed.</p>

				<title>The first complete mitochondrial genome from <i>Bostrychus</i> genus (<i>Bostrychus sinensis</i>) and partitioned Bayesian analysis of Eleotridae fish phylogeny</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0247-0257</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To understand the phylogenetic position of <i>Bostrychus sinensis</i> in Eleotridae and the phylogenetic relationships of the family, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial (mt) genome of <i>Bostrychus sinensis</i>. It is the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of <i>Bostrychus</i> genus. The entire mtDNA sequence was 16508 bp in length with a standard set of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and a noncoding control region. The mitochondrial genome of <i>B. sinensis</i> had common features with those of other bony fishes with respect to gene arrangement, base composition, and tRNA structures. Phylogenetic hypotheses within Eleotridae fish have been controversial at the genus level. We used the mitochondrial cytochrome b (<i>cytb</i>) gene sequence to examine phylogenetic relationships of Eleotridae by using partitioned Bayesian method. When the specific models and parameter estimates were presumed for partitioning the total data, the harmonic mean ‚ÄìlnL was improved. The phylogenetic analysis supported the monophyly of <i>Hypseleotris</i> and <i>Gobiomorphs</i>. In addition, the <i>Bostrychus</i> were most closely related to <i>Ophiocara</i>, and the <i>Philypnodon</i> is also the sister to <i>Microphlypnus</i>, based on the current datasets. Further, extensive taxonomic sampling and more molecular information are needed to confirm the phylogenetic relationships in Eleotridae.</p>

				<title>Distribution pattern of histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 during mitosis and meiosis in <i>Brachiaria</i> species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0259-0266</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Histones are the major eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins. Posttranslational modifications on N-terminal tails of histones that form nucleosomes are often associated with distinct biological functions. Some theories suggest that one of these modifications, the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10ph) plays a role in both chromosome condensation and sister chromatid cohesion. Although histones and some of their modifications are highly conserved, studies have shown that role and distribution of H3S10ph may differ between species. We evaluated the pattern of H3 phosphorylation using immunodetection during mitosis and meiosis in both diploid and tetraploid genotypes of <i>Brachiaria</i> species. Results revealed differences in chromosome distribution of H3S10ph when mitosis and meiosis were compared. Whole chromosomes were phosphorylated during meiosis I, whereas phosphorylation was restricted to the pericentromeric region in both meiosis II and mitosis. There was no variation in phosphorylation patterns between <i>Brachiaria</i> species and diploid and tetraploid genotypes. Regarding spatiotemporal coordination in the <i>Brachiaria</i> species evaluated, H3S10ph is related to maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during cell divisions.</p>

				<title>Genetic analysis and location of gene for resistance to stripe rust in wheat international differential host Strubes Dickkopf</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0267-0272</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Strubes Dickkopf is the sixth differential in the world set for wheat stripe (yellow) rust. It is very important to clarify its genetic character of resistance to stripe rust and to develop the molecular markers linked to resistance genes. The NIL Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf, which was obtained by Strubes Dickkopf as the gene donor and Taichung 29 as the genetic background through backcross breeding, was crossed with the recurrent parent Taichung 29, inbred, and backcrossed to obtain the F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub> and BC<sub>1</sub> population. The genetic analysis of the cross Taichung 29/(Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf) was assessed by inoculating the rust race CYR26 at seedling stage. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and F<sub>2</sub> segregation analysis were used for detecting polymorphic primers to locate the gene. The resistance of the NIL Taichung 29*6/Strubes Dickkopf to CYR26 was controlled by a single dominant gene, named <i>YrSD</i>. The primer pair Xbarc59 on 5B was linked to <i>YrSD</i> and the genetic distance between Xbarc59 and <i>YrSD</i> was 2.4 cM. The molecular marker Xbarc59 closely linked to the gene <i>YrSD</i> could be used in marker-assisted selection for resistance to stripe rust in wheat breeding programmes.</p>

				<page>0273-0280</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genetic diversity and identification of simple sequence repeat markers correlated with <i>Fusarium</i> wilt resistance was performed in a set of 36 elite cultivated pigeonpea genotypes differing in levels of resistance to <i>Fusarium</i> wilt. Twenty-four polymorphic sequence repeat markers were screened across these genotypes, and amplified a total of 59 alleles with an average high polymorphic information content value of 0.52. Cluster analysis, done by UPGMA and PCA, grouped the 36 pigeonpea genotypes into two main clusters according to their <i>Fusarium</i> wilt reaction. Based on the Kruskal‚ÄìWallis ANOVA and simple regression analysis, six simple sequence repeat markers were found to be significantly associated with <i>Fusarium</i> wilt resistance. The phenotypic variation explained by these markers ranged from 23.7 to 56.4%. The present study helps in finding out feasibility of prescreened SSR markers to be used in genetic diversity analysis and their potential association with disease resistance.</p>

				<page>0281-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The study of 1000-grain weight (TGW) and percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC) is very important in rice. In this study, a set of introgression lines (ILs), derived from Sasanishiki/Habataki with Sasanishiki as the recurrent parent, were used to detect correlations and quantitative trait loci (QTL) on TGW and PGWC in two different environments. Phenotypic correlation analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between TGW and PGWC in both environments, which indicated that the linkage of TGW and PGWC traits could be broken via suitable population. A total of 20 QTL were detected in both environments, nine QTL for 1000-paddy-grain weight (PTGW), five QTL for 1000-brown-grain weight (BTGW) and six QTL for percentage of grains with chalkiness (PGWC). Moreover, five QTL, <i>qPTGW3, qPTGW8.2, qPTGW11.1</i> for PTGW and <i>qPGWC1.1, qPGWC1.2</i> for PGWC, were stably expressed in both environments. Phenotypic values were significantly different ($P \lt 0.01$) between the introgression lines carrying these five QTL alleles and the genetic background parent, Sasanishiki. The introgression lines carrying these QTL also represent a useful genetic resource in the context of rice yield and quality improvement via a design-breeding approach.</p>

				<title>Search for missing schizophrenia genes will require a new developmental neurogenomic perspective</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0335-0340</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Even the most powerful experimental designs in search of genetic causes of schizophrenia have not met the desired goal. It is imperative to review the reasons for such an outcome and to formulate novel strategies for the future direction of this research in the new era of individual genomes. Here, we will review aspects of neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia in the light of novel genomic and epigenomic insights. Specifically, we will argue for the involvement of <i>de novo</i> mutations and epigenetic modifications during neurodevelopment that may result in schizophrenia. Our conclusion is that the successful elucidation of hereditary mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders must begin with attention to discrete endophenotypes; consideration of ontogeny, forethought of genome structure including temporal and spatial patterns of (epi) mutations and the use of judicious techniques that go beyond association studies.</p>

				<title>Effective population size and evolutionary dynamics in outbred laboratory populations of <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0349-0361</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Census population size, sex-ratio and female reproductive success were monitored in 10 laboratory populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> selected for different ages of reproduction. With this demographic information, we estimated eigenvalue, variance and probability of allele loss effective population sizes. We conclude that estimates of effective size based on genefrequency change at a few loci are biased downwards. We analysed the relative roles of selection and genetic drift in maintaining genetic variation in laboratory populations of <i>Drosophila</i>. We suggest that rare, favourable genetic variants in our laboratory populations have a high chance of being lost if their fitness effect is weak, e.g. 1% or less. However, if the fitness effect of this variation is 10% or greater, these rare variants are likely to increase to high frequency. The demographic information developed in this study suggests that some of our laboratory populations harbour more genetic variation than expected. One explanation for this finding is that part of the genetic variation in these outbred laboratory <i>Drosophila</i> populations may be maintained by some form of balancing selection. We suggest that, unlike bacteria, medium-term adaptation of laboratory populations of fruit flies is not primarily driven by new mutations, but rather by changes in the frequency of preexisting alleles.</p>

				<title>Expression profile of genes coding for carotenoid biosynthetic pathway during ripening and their association with accumulation of lycopene in tomato fruits</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0363-0368</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fruit ripening process is associated with change in carotenoid profile and accumulation of lycopene in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L.). In this study, we quantified the ùõΩ-carotene and lycopene content at green, breaker and red-ripe stages of fruit ripening in eight tomato genotypes by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the genotypes, lycopene content was found highest in Pusa Rohini and lowest in VRT-32-1. To gain further insight into the regulation of lycopene biosynthesis and accumulation during fruit ripening, expression analysis of nine carotenoid pathway-related genes was carried out in the fruits of high lycopene genotype‚ÄîPusa Rohini. We found that expression of phytoene synthase and ùõΩ-carotene hydroxylase-1 was four and thirty-fold higher, respectively, at breaker stage as compared to red-ripe stage of fruit ripening. Changes in the expression level of these genes were associated with a 40% increase in lycopene content at red-ripe stage as compared with breaker stage. Thus, the results from our study suggest the role of specific carotenoid pathway-related genes in accumulation of high lycopene during the fruit ripening processes.</p>

				<title>Pleiotropic phenotypes of the salt-tolerant and cytosine hypomethylated <i>leafless inflorescence, evergreen dwarf</i> and <i>irregular leaf lamina</i> mutants of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> possessing Mendelian inheritance</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0369-0394</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>, three morphological cum salt-tolerant chemically induced mutants ofMendelian inheritance and their wild-type parent cv Nirmal were characterized for overall cytosine methylation at DNA repeats, expression of 119 protein-coding and seven miRNA-coding genes and 50 quantitative traits. The mutants, named after their principal morphological feature(s), were <i>leafless inflorescence (lli), evergreen dwarf (egd)</i> and <i>irregular leaf lamina (ill)</i>. The Southern-blot analysis of <i>MspI</i> digested DNAs of mutants probed with centromeric and 5S and 18S rDNA probes indicated that, in comparison to wild type, the mutants were extensively demethylated at cytosine sites. Among the 126 genes investigated for transcriptional expression, 85 were upregulated and 41 were downregulated in mutants. All of the five genes known to be stress responsive had increased expression in mutants. Several miRNA genes showed either increased or decreased expression in mutants. The <i>C. roseus</i> counterparts of <i>CMT3, DRM2</i> and <i>RDR2</i> were downregulated in mutants. Among the cell, organ and plant size, photosynthesis and metabolism related traits studied, 28 traits were similarly affected in mutants as compared to wild type. Each of the mutants also expressed some traits distinctively. The <i>egd</i> mutant possessed superior photosynthesis and water retention abilities. Biomass was hyperaccumulated in roots, stems, leaves and seeds of the <i>lli</i> mutant. The <i>ill</i> mutant was richest in the pharmaceutical alkaloids catharanthine, vindoline, vincristine and vinblastine. The nature of mutations, origins of mutant phenotypes and evolutionary importance of these mutants are discussed.</p>

				<title>Association of <i>HS6ST3</i> gene polymorphisms with obesity and triglycerides: gene &#215; gender interaction</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0395-0402</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The <i>heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 3 (HS6ST3)</i> gene is involved in heparan sulphate and heparin metabolism, and has been reported to be associated with diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that <i>HS6ST3</i> gene polymorphisms might play an important role in obesity and related phenotypes (such as triglycerides). We examined genetic associations of 117 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the <i>HS6ST3</i> gene with obesity and triglycerides using two Caucasian samples: the Marshfield sample (1442 obesity cases and 2122 controls), and the Health aging and body composition (Health ABC) sample (305 cases and 1336 controls). Logistic regression analysis of obesity as a binary trait and linear regression analysis of triglycerides as a continuous trait, adjusted for age and sex, were performed using PLINK. Single marker analysis showed that six SNPs in the Marshfield sample and one SNP in the Health ABC sample were associated with obesity $(P \lt 0.05)$. SNP rs535812 revealed a stronger association with obesity in meta-analysis of these two samples $(P = 0.0105)$. The T‚ÄìA haplotype from rs878950 and rs9525149 revealed significant association with obesity in the Marshfield sample $(P = 0.012)$. Moreover, nine SNPs showed associations with triglycerides in the Marshfield sample $(P \lt 0.05)$ and the best signal was rs1927796 $(P = 0.00858)$. In addition, rs7331762 showed a strong gene &#215; gender interaction $(P = 0.00956)$ for obesity while rs1927796 showed a strong gene &#215; gender interaction $(P = 0.000625)$ for triglycerides in the Marshfield sample. These findings contribute new insights into the pathogenesis of obesity and triglycerides and demonstrate the importance of gender differences in the aetiology.</p>

				<title>Analysis of dinucleotide signatures in HIV-1 subtype B genomes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0403-0412</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dinucleotide usage is known to vary in the genomes of organisms. The dinucleotide usage profiles or genome signatures are similar for sequence samples taken from the same genome, but are different for taxonomically distant species. This concept of genome signatures has been used to study several organisms including viruses, to elucidate the signatures of evolutionary processes at the genome level. Genome signatures assume greater importance in the case of host‚Äìpathogen interactions, where molecular interactions between the two species take place continuously, and can influence their genomic composition. In this study, analyses of whole genome sequences of the HIV-1 subtype B, a retrovirus that caused global pandemic of AIDS, have been carried out to analyse the variation in genome signatures of the virus from 1983 to 2007.We show statistically significant temporal variations in some dinucleotide patterns highlighting the selective evolution of the dinucleotide profiles of HIV-1 subtype B, possibly a consequence of host specific selection.</p>

				<title>An estimating function approach to linkage heterogeneity</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0413-0421</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Testing linkage heterogeneity between two loci is an important issue in genetics. Currently, there are four methods (K-test, A-test, B-test and D-test) for testing linkage heterogeneity in linkage analysis, which are based on the likelihood-ratio test. Among them, the commonly used methods are the K-test and A-test. In this paper, we present a novel test method which is different from the above four tests, called G-test. The new test statistic is based on estimating function, possessing a theoretic asymptotic distribution, and therefore demonstrates its own advantages. The proposed test is applied to analyse a real pedigree dataset. Our simulation results also indicate that the G-test performs well in terms of power of testing linkage heterogeneity and outperforms the current methods to some degree.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0423-0432</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Odontamblyopus rubicundus</i> is a species of gobiid fishes, inhabits muddy-bottomed coastal waters. In this paper, the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of <i>O. rubicundus</i> is reported. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence is 17119 bp in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, a control region and an L-strand origin as in other teleosts. Most mitochondrial genes are encoded on H-strand except for <i>ND6</i> and seven tRNA genes. Some overlaps occur in protein-coding genes and tRNAs ranging from 1 to 7 bp. The possibly nonfunctional L-strand origin folded into a typical stem-loop secondary structure and a conserved motif (5&#8242;-GCCGG-3&#8242;) was found at the base of the stem within the $tRNA^{Cys}$ gene. The TAS, CSB-2 and CSB-3 could be detected in the control region. However, in contrast to most of other fishes, the central conserved sequence block domain and the CSB-1 could not be recognized in <i>O. rubicundus</i>, which is consistent with <i>Acanthogobius hasta</i> (Gobiidae). In addition, phylogenetic analyses based on different sequences of species of Gobiidae and different methods showed that the classification of <i>O. rubicundus</i> into <i>Odontamblyopus</i> due to morphology is debatable.</p>

				<title>Mapping quantitative trait loci associated with yield and yield components under reproductive stage salinity stress in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0433-0443</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Salinity tolerance in rice is critical at reproductive stage because it ultimately determines grain yield. An F<sub>2</sub> mapping population derived from a Sadri/FL478 cross was exposed to saline field conditions (6‚Äì8 dS m<sup>-1</sup>) after the active tillering stage to identify reproductive stage specific QTLs for salinity tolerance. Genetic linkage map was constructed using 123 microsatellite markers on 232 F<sub>2</sub> progenies. Totally 35 QTLs for 11 traits under salinity stress were detected with LOD &#62;3, out of which 28 QTLs that explained from 5.9 to 30.0% phenotypic variation were found to be significant based on permutation test. Three major QTL clusters were found on chromosomes 2 (RM423‚ÄìRM174), 4 (RM551‚ÄìRM518) and 6 (RM20224‚ÄìRM528) for multiple traits under salinity stress. Both parental lines contributed additively for QTLs identified for the yield components. A majority of the QTLs detected in our study are reported for the first time for reproductive stage salinity stress. Fine-mapping of selected putative QTLs will be the next step to facilitate marker-assisted backcrossing and to detect useful genes for salinity tolerance at the reproductive stage in rice.</p>

				<title>Construction of microsatellite-based linkage map and mapping of nectarilessness and hairiness genes in <i>Gossypium tomentosum</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0445-0459</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Gossypium tomentosum</i>, a wild tetraploid cotton species with AD genomes, possesses genes conferring strong fibers and high heat tolerance. To effectively transfer these genes into <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>, an entire microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR)-based genetic map was constructed using the interspecific cross of <i>G. hirsutum</i> &#215; <i>G. tomentosum</i> (HT). We detected 1800 loci from 1347 pairs of polymorphic primers. Of these, 1204 loci were grouped into 35 linkage groups at LOD &#8805;4. The map covers 3320.8 cM, with a mean density of 2.76 cM per locus. We detected 420 common loci (186 in the At subgenome and 234 in Dt) between the HT map and the map of TM-1 (<i>G. hirsutum</i>) and Hai 7124 (<i>G. barbadense</i>; HB map). The linkage groups were assigned chromosome numbers based on location of common loci and the HB map as reference. A comparison of common markers revealed that no significant chromosomal rearrangement exist between <i>G. tomentosum</i> and <i>G. barbadense</i>. Interestingly, however, we detected numerous (33.7%) segregation loci deviating from 3:1 ratio ($P \lt 0.05$) in HT, mostly clustering on eight chromosomes in the Dt subgenome, with some on three chromosomes in At. Two morphological traits, leaf hairiness and leaf nectarilessness were mapped on chromosomes 6 (A6) and 26 (D12), respectively. The SSR-based map constructed in this study will be useful for further genetic studies on cotton breeding, including mapping loci controlling quantitative traits associated with fiber quality, stress tolerance and developing chromosome segment specific introgression lines from <i>G. tomentosum</i> into <i>G. hirsutum</i> using marker-assisted selection.</p>

				<title>Two <i>P5CS</i> genes from common bean exhibiting different tolerance to salt stress in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0461-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Many plants accumulate proline in response to salt stress. ùõ•-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) is the rate-limiting enzyme in proline biosynthesis in plants. Plasmid DNA (pCHF3-PvP5CS1 and pCHF3-PvP5CS2) containing the selectable neomycin phosphotransferase gene for kanamycin resistance and <i>Phaseolus vulgaris P5CS</i> (<i>PvP5CS1</i> and <i>PvP5CS2</i>) cDNA was introduced into <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants using <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated gene transfer. Southern blot, northern blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that the foreign genes were integrated into <i>Arabidopsis</i> chromosomal DNA and expressed. Single-gene transformants were analysed in this study. Transgenic plants expressed higher levels of <i>PvP5CS1</i> and <i>PvP5CS2</i> transcripts under salt stress conditions than under normal conditions. When treated with 0, 100 and 200 mM NaCl, the average proline content in leaves of transgenic plants was significantly higher $(P \lt 0.01)$ than control plants. The average relative electrical conductivity (REC) of transgenic lines was significantly lower $(P \lt 0.01)$ than control plants under salt stress condition. Biomass production of transgenic lines was significantly higher $(P \lt 0.05)$ than control plants under 200 mM NaCl stress treatment. These results indicated that introducing <i>PvP5CS1</i> and <i>PvP5CS2</i> cDNA into transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> caused proline overproduction, increasing salt tolerance. Although the expression of <i>PvP5CS1</i> in L4 lines and <i>PvP5CS2</i> in S4 lines was the same under salt stress condition, the S4 lines accumulated 1.6 and 1.9 times more proline than the L4 lines under 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments, respectively. The REC of S4 plants was 0.5 (100 mM NaCl) and 0.6 times (200 mM NaCl) that of L4 plants. The biomass production of S4 plants was 1.6 times (200 mM NaCl) more than in L4 plants. Total P5CS enzyme activity of S4 was significantly higher than that of L4. These results implied that the PvP5CS2 protein had stronger capacity to catalyze proline synthesis than PvP5CS1 under salt stress condition.</p>

				<title>Cloning, characterization and expression of $OsFMO_{(t)}$ in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0471-0480</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Flavin monooxygenases (FMO) play a key role in tryptophan (Trp)-dependent indole-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis in plants and regulate plant growth and development. In this study, the full-length genomic DNA and cDNA of $OsFMO_{(t)}$, a FMO gene that was originally identified from a rolled-leaf mutant in rice, was isolated and cloned from wild type of the rolled-leaf mutant. $OsFMO_{(t)}$ was found to have four exons and three introns, and encode a protein with 422 amino acid residues that contains two basic conserved motifs, with a ‚ÄòG&#215;ùê∫&#215;&#215;G‚Äô characteristic structure. OsFMO<sub>(t)</sub> showed high amino acid sequence identity with FMO proteins from other plants, in particular with YUCCA from <i>Arabidopsis</i>, FLOOZY from <i>Petunia</i>, and OsYUCCA1 from rice. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that OsFMO$_{\text{(t)}}$ and the homologous FMO proteins belong to the same clade in the evolutionary tree. Overexpression of $OsFMO_{(t)}$ in transformed rice calli produced IAA-excessive phenotypes that showed browning and lethal effects when exogenous auxins such as naphthylacetic acid (NAA) were added to the medium. These results suggested that the OsFMO$_{\text{(t)}}$ protein is involved in IAA biosynthesis in rice and its overexpression could lead to the malformation of calli. Spatio-temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR and histochemical analysis for GUS activity revealed that expression of $OsFMO_{(t)}$ was totally absent in the rolled-leaf mutant. However, in the wild type variety, this gene was expressed at different levels temporally and spatially, with the highest expression observed in tissues with fast growth and cell division such as shoot apexes, tender leaves and root tips. Our results demonstrated that IAA biosynthesis regulated by $OsFMO_{(t)}$ is likely localized and might play an essential role in shaping local IAA concentrations which, in turn, is critical for regulating normal growth and development in rice.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Fat mass and obesity-associated (<i>FTO</i>) gene codes for a nuclear protein of the AlkB related nonhaem iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily, and is involved in animal fat deposition and human obesity. In this work, the molecular characterization and expression features of rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) <i>FTO</i> cDNA were analysed. The rabbit FTO cDNA with a size of 2158 bp was cloned, including 1515 bp of the open reading frame that encoded a basic protein of 504 amino acids. Homologous comparison indicated that the rabbit FTO shared 36.36‚Äì91.88% identity with those from other species and phylogenetic analysis showed that the rabbit FTO is closely related to human, but more distantly related to zebrafish. The New Zealand rabbit <i>FTO</i> mRNA was detected in all tissues examined, with the highest levels found in the spleen and the lowest found in the kidney. However, no significant differences were seen in cerebellum, corpora quadrigemina, medulla oblongata and cerebral cortex of commercial adult rabbits. Moreover, mRNA levels of <i>FTO</i> in liver tissues were significantly increased in lactating New Zealand rabbits compared with 70-day-old, 90-day-old and gestating rabbits $(P \lt 0.05)$. In contrast, <i>FTO</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in longissimus dorsi muscle of 90-day-old New Zealand rabbits than in 70-day-old rabbits $(P \lt 0.05)$. However, the expression levels of <i>FTO</i> in mammary gland and ovary of gestating and lactating rabbits were not significantly different $(P \gt 0.05)$.</p>

				<title>Analysis of regulatory networks constructed based on gene coexpression in pituitary adenoma</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0489-0497</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Gene coexpression patterns can reveal gene collections with functional consistency. This study systematically constructs regulatory networks for pituitary tumours by integrating gene coexpression, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Through network analysis, we elaborate the incidence mechanism of pituitary adenoma. The Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient was utilized to calculate the level of gene coexpression. By comparing pituitary adenoma samples with normal samples, pituitary adenoma-specific gene coexpression patterns were identified. For pituitary adenoma-specific coexpressed genes, we integrated transcription factor (TF) and microRNA (miRNA) regulation to construct a complex regulatory network from the transcriptional and posttranscriptional perspectives. Network module analysis identified the synergistic regulation of genes by miRNAs and TFs in pituitary adenoma. We identified 142 pituitary adenoma-specific active genes, including 43 TFs and 99 target genes of TFs. Functional enrichment of these 142 genes revealed that the occurrence of pituitary adenoma induced abnormalities in intracellular metabolism and angiogenesis process. These 142 genes were also significantly enriched in adenoma pathway. Module analysis of the systematic regulatory network found that three modules contained elements that were closely related to pituitary adenoma, such as FGF2 and SP1, as well as transcription factors and miRNAs involved in the tumourigenesis. These results show that in the occurrence of pituitary adenoma, miRNA, TF and genes interact with each other. Based on gene expression, the proposed method integrates interaction information from different levels and systematically explains the occurrence of pituitary tumours. It facilitates the tracing of the origin of the disease and can provide basis for early diagnosis of complex diseases or cancer without obvious symptoms.</p>

				<title>Cytosine hypomethylation at CHG and CHH sites in the pleiotropic mutants of Mendelian inheritance in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0499-0511</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The 5S and 18S rDNA sequences of <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> cv ‚ÄòNirmal‚Äô (wild type) and its leafless inflorescence (<i>lli</i>), <i>evergreen dwarf</i> (<i>egd</i>) and <i>irregular leaf lamina</i> (<i>ill</i>) single mutants and <i>lli egd, lli ill</i> and <i>egd ill</i> double mutants were characterized. The <i>lli, egd</i> and <i>ill</i> mutants of Mendelian inheritance bore the names after their most conspicuous morphological feature(s). They had been chemically induced and isolated for their salt tolerance. The double mutants were isolated as morphological segregants from crosses between single mutants. The morphological features of the two parents accompanied salt tolerance in the double mutants. All the six mutants were hypomethylated at repeat sequences, upregulated and downregulated for many genes and carried pleiotropic alterations for several traits. Here the 5S and 18S rDNAs of <i>C. roseus</i> were found to be relatively low in cytosine content. Cytosines were preponderantly in CG context (53%) and almost all of them were methylated (97%). The cytosines in CHH and CHG (where H = A, T or C) contexts were largely demethylated (92%) in mutants. The demethylation was attributable to reduced expression of <i>RDR2</i> and <i>DRM2</i> led RNA dependant DNA methylation and <i>CMT3</i> led maintenance methylation pathways. Mutants had gained some cytosines by substitution of C at T sites. These perhaps arose on account of errors in DNA replication, mediated by widespread cytosine demethylation at CHG and CHH sites. It was concluded that the regulation of cytosine methylation mechanisms was disturbed in the mutants. <i>ILL, EGD</i> and <i>LLI</i> genes were identified as the positive regulators of other genes mediating the RdDM and CMT3 pathways, for establishment and maintenance of cytosine methylation in <i>C. roseus.</i></p>

				<title>Identification and expression analysis of primary auxin-responsive <i>Aux/IAA</i> gene family in cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0513-0521</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Aux/IAA</i> is an important gene family involved in many aspects of growth and development. Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that are induced primarily by various phytohormones. In this study, 29 <i>Aux/IAA</i> family genes (<i>CsIAA01‚ÄìCsIAA29</i>) were identified and characterized in cucumber, including gene structures, phylogenetic relationships, conserved protein motifs and chromosomal locations. These genes show distinct organizational patterns of their putative motifs. The distributions of the genes vary: except for five <i>CsIAA</i> genes in cucumber that were not located, seven <i>CsIAA</i> genes were found on scaffold, while the other 17 <i>CsIAA</i> genes were distributed on seven other chromosomes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the Aux/IAA protein sequences from cucumber, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and other plants, the <i>Aux/IAA</i> genes in cucumber were categorized into seven subfamilies. To investigate whether the expression of <i>CsIAA</i> genes is associated with auxin induction, their transcript levels were monitored in seedlings treated with IAA (indole-3-acetic acid), and their expression patterns were analysed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that 11/29 <i>CsIAA</i> genes were expressed in leaves whether treated with IAA or not and the time course of processing and compared with the control, five <i>CsIAA</i> genes showed low expression only after 60 min treatment with IAA, while 11 genes showed no expression. These results provide useful information for further functional analysis of <i>Aux/IAA</i> gene family in cucumber.</p>

				<title>Molecular analysis of intragenic recombination at the tryptophan synthetase locus in <i>Neurospora crassa</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0523-0528</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Fifteen different classically generated and mapped mutations at the tryptophan synthetase locus in <i>Neurospora crassa</i> have been characterized to the level of the primary sequence of the gene. This sequence analysis has demonstrated that intragenic recombination is accurate to order mutations within one open reading frame. While classic genetic analysis correctly ordered the mutations, the position of mutations characterized by gene sequence analysis was more accurate. A leaky mutation was found to have a wild-type primary sequence. The presence of unique polymorphisms in the primary sequence of the <i>trp-3</i> gene from strain 861 confirms that it has a unique history relative to the other strains studied. Most strains that were previously shown to be immunologically nonreactive with antibody preparations raised against tryptophan synthetase protein were shown to have nonsense mutations. This work defines 14 alleles of the <i>N. crassa trp-3</i> gene.</p>

				<page>0529-0543</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The NCII design (North Carolina mating design II) has been widely applied in studies of combining ability and heterosis. The objective of our research was to estimate how different base populations, sample sizes, testcross numbers and heritability influence QTL analyses of combining ability and heterosis. A series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments with QTL mapping were then conducted for the base population performance, testcross population phenotypic values and the general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA) and Hmp (midparental heterosis) datasets. The results indicated that:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>increasing the number of testers did not necessarily enhance the QTL detection power for GCA, but it was significantly related to the QTL effect.</li>
						<li>The QTLs identified in the base population may be different from those from GCA dataset. Similar phenomena can be seen from QTL detected in SCA and Hmp datasets.</li>
						<li>The QTL detection power for GCA ranked in the order of DH(RIL) based &#62; F<sub>2</sub> based &#62; BC based NCII design, when the heritability was low.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (or DHs) allows more recombination and offers higher mapping resolution than other populations. Further, their testcross progeny can be repeatedly generated and phenotyped. Thus, RIL based (or DH based) NCII design was highly recommend for combining ability QTL analysis. Our results expect to facilitate selecting elite parental lines with high combining ability and for geneticists to research the genetic basis of combining ability.</p>

				<title>Assessment of genetic diversity in Indian rice germplasm (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.): use of random versus trait-linked microsatellite markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0545-0557</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Assessment of genetic diversity in a crop germplasm is a vital part of plant breeding. DNA markers such as microsatellite or simple sequence repeat markers have been widely used to estimate the genetic diversity in rice. The present study was carried out to decipher the pattern of genetic diversity in terms of both phenotypic and genotypic variability, and to assess the efficiency of random vis-√†-vis QTL linked/gene based simple sequence repeat markers in diversity estimation. A set of 88 rice accessions that included landraces, farmer‚Äôs varieties and popular Basmati lines were evaluated for agronomic traits and molecular diversity. The random set of SSR markers included 50 diversity panel markers developed under IRRI‚Äôs Generation Challenge Programme (GCP) and the trait-linked/gene based markers comprised of 50 SSR markers reportedly linked to yield and related components. For agronomic traits, significant variability was observed, ranging between the maximum for grains/panicle and the minimum for panicle length. The molecular diversity based grouping indicated that varieties from a common centre were genetically similar, with few exceptions. The trait-linked markers gave an average genetic dissimilarity of 0.45 as against that of 0.37 by random markers, along with an average polymorphic information constant value of 0.48 and 0.41 respectively. The correlation between the kinship matrix generated by trait-linked markers and the phenotype based distance matrix (0.29) was higher than that of random markers (0.19). This establishes the robustness of trait-linked markers over random markers in estimating genetic diversity of rice germplasm.</p>

				<title>Tumour necrosis factor alpha (<i>TNF</i>-ùõº) genetic polymorphisms and the risk of autoimmune liver disease: a meta-analysis</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0617-0628</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between tumour necrosis factor alpha (<i>TNF</i>-ùõº)-308G/A and (<i>TNF</i>-ùõº)-238G/A polymorphisms, and the risk of autoimmune liver disease (AILD), yet the results are conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed this meta-analysis. A systematic review was conducted to identify all eligible studies of <i>TNF</i>-ùõº polymorphisms and AILD risk. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association between the two <i>TNF</i>-ùõº polymorphisms and AILD risk. A total of 15 eligible studies were identified. Overall, positive associations of -308G/A polymorphism with AILD risk were found (A vs G allele: OR = 1.45, 95%,CI = 1.13‚Äì1.86; AA vs GG: OR = 2.74, 95%,CI = 1.51‚Äì4.96; GA vs GG: OR = 1.46, 95%,CI = 1.11‚Äì1.92; dominant model: OR = 1.57, 95%,CI = 1.18‚Äì2.10; recessive model: OR = 2.22, 95%,CI = 1.31‚Äì3.76). In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, a significantly higher risk was found in Caucasians. In subgroup analysis by AILD category, significant association was observed in autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, especially in Caucasians. Patients carrying <i>TNF</i>-ùõº-238A allele had a slightly decreased risk of developing AILD (OR = 0.65, 95%,CI = 0.48‚Äì0.87). However, we found both <i>TNF</i>-ùõº polymorphisms were not associated with primary biliary cirrhosis risk, even in subgroup analysis. Our metaanalysis suggests that the <i>TNF</i>-ùõº-308G/A and -238G/A polymorphisms may contribute to AILD susceptibility in Caucasians, especially for autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Nevertheless, we found both <i>TNF</i>-ùõº polymorphisms were unlikely to be associated with the risk of primary biliary cirrhosis.</p>

				<title>Roles, and establishment, maintenance and erasing of the epigenetic cytosine methylation marks in plants</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0629-0666</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Heritable information in plants consists of genomic information in DNA sequence and epigenetic information superimposed on DNA sequence. The latter is in the form of cytosine methylation at CG, CHG and CHH elements (where H = A, T or C) and a variety of histone modifications in nucleosomes. The epialleles arising from cytosine methylation marks on the nuclear genomic loci have better heritability than the epiallelic variation due to chromatin marks. Phenotypic variation is increased manifold by epiallele comprised methylomes. Plants (angiosperms) have highly conserved genetic mechanisms to establish, maintain or erase cytosine methylation from epialleles. The methylation marks in plants fluctuate according to the cell/tissue/organ in the vegetative and reproductive phases of plant life cycle. They also change according to environment. Epialleles arise by gain or loss of cytosine methylation marks on genes. The changes occur due to the imperfection of the processes that establish and maintain the marks and on account of spontaneous and stress imposed removal of marks. Cytosine methylation pattern acquired in response to abiotic or biotic stress is often inherited over one to several subsequent generations. Cytosine methylation marks affect physiological functions of plants via their effect(s) on gene expression levels. They also repress transposable elements that are abundantly present in plant genomes. The density of their distribution along chromosome lengths affects meiotic recombination rate, while their removal increases mutation rate. Transposon activation due to loss of methylation causes rearrangements such that new gene regulatory networks arise and genes for microRNAs may originate. Cytosine methylation dynamics contribute to evolutionary changes. This review presents and discusses the available evidence on origin, removal and roles of cytosine methylation and on related processes, such as RNA directed DNA methylation, imprinting, paramutation and transgenerational memory in plants.</p>

				<title>Role of Notch signalling pathway in cancer and its association with DNA methylation</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0667-0675</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Notch signalling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell signalling pathway involved in the development of organisms as diverse as humans and fruit flies. It plays a pivotal role in cell fate determination. Dysregulated Notch signalling is oncogenic, inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival. Abnormal Notch signalling is seen in many cancers like T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and cancers of the breast, cervix, colon, pancreas, skin and brain. Inhibition of Notch signalling leads to growth arrest and differentiation in those cells in which Notch pathway is activated and this represents a new target for cancer therapy. Cancer develops from genome defects, including both genetic and epigenetic alterations. Epigenetics deals with heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence. Among various epigenetic alterations such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and sumoylation, promoter region methylation is considered as an important component in cancer development. Epigenetic alterations can be used as biomarkers in screening, detection, diagnosis, staging and risk stratification of various cancers. DNA methylation can be therapeutically reversed and demethylating drugs have proven to be promising in cancer treatment. This review focusses on the methylation status of genes in Notch signalling pathway from various cancers and how this epigenetic alteration can be used as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.</p>

				<title>Human genetics of diabetic vascular complications</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0677-0694</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Diabetic vascular complications (DVC) affecting several important organ systems of human body such as the cardiovascular system constitute a major public health problem. There is evidence demonstrating that genetic factors contribute to the risk of DVC genetic variants, structural variants, and epigenetic changes play important roles in the development of DVC. Genetic linkage studies have uncovered a number of genetic loci that may shape the risk of DVC. Genetic association studies have identified many common genetic variants for susceptibility to DVC. Structural variants such as copy number variation and interactions of gene &#215; environment have also been detected by association analysis. Apart from the nuclear genome, mitochondrial DNA plays a critical role in regulation of development of DVC. Epigenetic studies have indicated epigenetic changes in chromatin affecting gene transcription in response to environmental stimuli, which provided a large body of evidence of regulating development of diabetes mellitus. Recently, a new window has opened on identifying rare and common genetic loci through next generation sequencing technologies. This review focusses on the current knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic basis of DVC. Ultimately, identification of genes or genetic loci, structural variants and epigenetic changes contributing to risk of or protection from DVC will help uncover the complex mechanism(s) underlying DVC, with crucial implications for the development of personalized medicine for diabetes mellitus and its complications.</p>

				<title>Association studies of dormancy and cooking quality traits in direct-seeded <i>indica</i> rice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0003-0012</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Association analysis was applied to a panel of accessions of Assam rice (<i>indica</i>) using 98 SSR markers for dormancy-related traits and cooking quality. Analysis of population structure revealed 10 subgroups in the population. The mean $r^2$ and $D'$ value for all intrachromosomal loci pairs was 0.24 and 0.51, respectively. Linkage disequilibrium between linked markers decreased with distance. Marker-trait associations were investigated using the unified mixed-model approach, considering both population structure (Q) and kinship (K). Genome-wide scanning, detected a total of seven significant marker-trait associations $(P \lt 0.01)$, with the $R^2$ values ranging from 12.0 to 18.0%. The significant marker associations were for grain dormancy (RM27 on chromosome 2), ùõº-amylase activity (RM27 and RM234 on chromosomes 2 and 7, respectively), germination (RM27 and RM106 on chromosome 2), amylose (RM282 on chromosome 3) and grain length elongation ratio (RM142 on chromosome 4). The present study revealed the association of marker RM27 with traits like dormancy, Œ±-amylase activity and germination. Simple correlation analysis of these traits revealed that these traits were positively correlated with each other and this marker may be useful for simultaneous improvement of these traits. The study indicates the presence of novel QTLs for a few traits under consideration. The study reveals association of traits like dormancy, ùõº-amylase activity, germination, amylose content, grain length elongation ratio with SSR markers indicating the feasibility of undertaking association analysis in conjunction with germplasm characterization.</p>

				<title>The first genetic linkage map of <i>Eucommia ulmoides</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0013-0020</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In accordance with pseudo-testcross strategy, the first genetic linkage map of <i>Eucommia ulmoides</i> Oliv. was constructed by an F<sub>1</sub> population of 122 plants using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 22 AFLP primer combinations generated 363 polymorphic markers. We selected 289 markers segregating as 1:1 and used them for constructing the parent-specific linkage maps. Among the candidate markers, 127 markers were placed on the maternal map LF and 108 markers on the paternal map Q1. The maternal map LF spanned 1116.1 cM in 14 linkage groups with a mean map distance of 8.78 cM; the paternal map Q1 spanned 929.6 cM in 12 linkage groups with an average spacing of 8.61 cM. The estimated coverage of the genome through two methods was 78.5 and 73.9% for LF, and 76.8 and 71.2% for Q1, respectively. This map is the first linkage map of <i>E. ulmoides</i> and provides a basis for mapping quantitative-trait loci and breeding applications.</p>

				<title>Identification of a human <i>ABCC10</i> orthologue in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> reveals a U12-type intron determinant for the N-terminal domain feature</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0021-0033</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters are members of a large superfamily of proteins that utilize ATP hydrolysis to translocate a wide range of substrates across biological membranes. In general, members of C subfamily (ABCC) are structurally characterized by an additional (N-terminal) transmembrane domain (TMD0). Phylogenetic analysis of plant ABCCs separates their protein sequences into three distinct clusters: I and II are plant specific whereas cluster III contains both human and plant ABCCs. Screening of the Plant Medicinal Genomics Resource database allowed us to identify 16 ABCCs partial sequences in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>; two of which belong to the unique <i>CrABCC1</i> transcript that we identified in cluster III. Genomic organization of <i>CrABCC1</i> TMD0 coding sequence displays an AT-AC U12-type intron that is conserved in higher plant orthologues. We showed that <i>CrABCC1</i>, like its human orthologue <i>ABCC10</i>, produces alternative transcripts that encode protein sequences with a truncated form of TMD0 without the first transmembrane span (TM1). Subcellular localization of CrABCC1 TMD0 variants using yellow fluorescent protein fusions reveals that the TM1 is required for a correct routing of the TMD0 to the tonoplast. Finally, the specific repartition of <i>CrABCC1</i> orthologues in some species suggests that this gene was lost several times during evolution and that its physiological function may, rely on a common feature of multicellular eukaryotes.</p>

				<title>The ùõæ-gliadin-like ùõæ-prolamin genes in the tribe Triticeae</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0035-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ùõæ-prolamins are important components of seed storage proteins in wheat and other Triticeae species. Here, the ùõæ-prolamin genes from the diploid Triticeae species were systemically characterized. Most of the ùõæ-prolamins (except 75 K ùõæ-secalins) characterized were defined as ùõæ-gliadin-like ùõæ-prolamins, since they shared same characteristic model structure with ùõæ-gliadins. Over one-third of these putatively functional ùõæ-prolamin peptides contained different number of cysteine residues as compared to the eight residues present in ùõæ-gliadins. Sequence polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium analyses showed the conservation of ùõæ-prolamin genes in Triticeae species under evolutionary selection. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these ùõæ-prolamin genes can not be clearly separated according to their genomic origins, reflecting the conservation of ùõæ-gliadin-like ùõæ-prolamin genes after the divergence of Triticeae species. A screening of coeliac disease (CD) toxic epitopes shows that the ùõæ-prolamins from some other genomes contain much fewer epitopes than those from the A, S (B) and D genomes of wheat. These findings contribute to better understanding of ùõæ-prolamin family in Triticeae and build a ground for breeding less CD-toxic wheat cultivars.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0043-0051</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a short-day crop and the photoperiod is a crucial factor regulating its flowering time. To investigate the molecular mechanism controlling the flowering time by photoperiod in soybean, cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) was used to identify photoperiod-regulated genes in leaves of soybean growing under short-day length, neutral photoperiod and long-day length. A total of 36 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were identified to be regulated by photoperiod. Among them, 26 TDFs were homologues of genes with known function. These genes are involved in secondary metabolism, cellular metabolism, cell wall components metabolism, ion transport and hormone signalling. Silencing of the homologue genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> for 14 TDFs was conducted by virus-induced gene silencing. The flowering time was delayed by silencing of the genes encoding rhodanese and 40S ribosomal protein S4 (RPS4). The results indicated that rhodanese and RPS4 probably play important roles in regulating flowering time.</p>

				<title>Molecular characterization and differential expression of two duplicated odorant receptor genes, <i>AcerOr1</i> and <i>AcerOr3</i>, in <i>Apis cerana cerana</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0053-0061</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Insects use olfaction to recognize a wide range of volatile cues, to locate food sources, mates, hosts and oviposition sites. These chemical volatiles are perceived by odorant receptors (ORs) expressed on the dendritic membrane of olfactory neurons, most of which are housed within the chemosensilla of antennae. Most insect ORs are tandemly arrayed on chromosomes and some of them are formed by gene duplication. Here, we identified a pair of duplicated <i>Or</i> genes, <i>AcerOr1</i> and <i>AcerOr3</i>, from the antennae of the Asian honeybee, <i>Apis cerana cerana</i>, and reported their molecular characterization and temporal expression profiles. The results showed that these two genes shared high similarity both in sequence and the gene structure. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of temporal expression pattern indicated that in drones the expression pattern of these two genes were very similar. The transcripts expressed weakly in larvae and pupae, then increased gradually in adults. In workers, the expression level of <i>AcerOr1</i> changed more drastically and expressed higher than that of <i>AcerOr3</i>. However, both reached their highest expression level in one-day-old adults. In addition, the expression profiles between different sexes revealed that <i>AcerOr3</i> appear to be expressed biased in male antennae. These results suggest that AcerOr1 may perceive odours of floral scents, while <i>AcerOr3</i> may detect odours critical to male behaviour, such as the queen substance cues.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Roots are involved in acquisition of water and nutrients, as well as in providing structural support to plant. The root system provides a dynamic model for developmental analysis. Here, we investigated quantitative trait loci (QTL), dynamic conditional QTL and epistatic interactions for seedling root traits using an upland cotton F<sub>2</sub> population and a constructed genetic map. Totally, 37 QTLs for root traits, 35 dynamic conditional QTLs based on the net increased amount of root traits (root tips, forks, length, surface area and volume)</p>
					<ol>
						<li>after transplanting 10 days compared to 5 days, and</li>
						<li>after transplanting 15 days to 10 days were detected. Obvious dynamic characteristic of QTL and dynamic conditional QTL existed at different developmental stages of root because QTL and dynamic conditional QTL had not been detected simultaneously.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We further confirmed that additive and dominance effects of QTL <i>qRSA-chr1-1</i> in interval time 5 to 10 DAT (days after transplant) offset the effects in 10 to 15 DAT. Lots of two-locus interactions for root traits were identified unconditionally or dynamically, and a few epistatic interactions were only detected simultaneously in interval time of 5‚Äì10 DAT and 10‚Äì15 DAT, suggesting different interactive genetic mechanisms on root development at different stages. Dynamic conditional QTL and epistasis effects provide new attempts to understand the dynamics of roots and provide clues for root architecture selection in upland cotton.</p>

				<title>Genomewide analysis of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES Domain gene family in <i>Zea mays</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The investigation of transcription factor (TF) families is a major focus of postgenomic research. The plant-specific ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE (ASL) / LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES Domain (LBD) proteins constitute a major zincfinger-like-domain transcription factor family, and regulate diverse biological processes in plants. However, little is known about LBD genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). In this study, a total of 44 LBD genes were identified in maize genome and were phylogenetically clustered into two groups (I and II), together with LBDs from <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The predicted maize <i>LBD</i>s were distributed across all the 10 chromosomes with different densities. In addition, the gene structures of maize <i>LBD</i>s were analysed. The expression profiles of the maize <i>LBD</i> genes under normal growth conditions were analysed by microarray data and qRT-PCR. The results indicated that <i>LBD</i>s might be involved in various aspects of physiological and developmental processes in maize. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genomewide analysis of the maize <i>LBD</i> gene family, which would provide valuable information for understanding the classification and putative functions of the gene family.</p>

				<title>Genomewide survey and characterization of metacaspase gene family in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0093-0102</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metacaspases (MCs), which are cysteine-dependent proteases found in plants, fungi, and protozoa, may be involved in programmed cell death processes, being distant relatives of metazoan caspases. In this study, we analysed the structures, phylogenetic relationship, genome localizations, expression patterns and domestic selections of eight <i>MC</i> genes identified in rice (<i>OsMC</i>). Alignment analysis of the corresponding protein sequences suggested OsMC proteins can be classified into two sub-types. The expression profiles of eight <i>OsMC</i> genes were analysed in 27 tissues covering the whole life cycle of rice. There are four <i>OsMC</i> genes uniquely expressed in mature tissues, indicating that these genes might play certain roles in senescence. Under abiotic and biotic stresses, four <i>OsMC</i> genes were expressed with treatments of one or more of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (<i>M. oryzae</i>) infected, pest damaged, cold stress and drought stress, indicating they might be involved in plant defense. In addition, gene trees and genetic diversity $(\pi)$ were performed to measure whether candidate genes were selected during rice domestication. The results suggested that all the type I genes could not be domestication genes. However, two of five type II <i>OsMC</i> genes showed strong evidence for selective sweep, suggesting that these genes might be involved in cultivated rice domestication. These results provide a foundation for future functional genomic studies of this family in rice.</p>

				<title>Effects of body-size variation on flight-related traits in latitudinal populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0103-0112</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis whether flight-related traits such as wing area, flight-muscle ratio, wing loading and dispersal yield evidence of geographical variation in nine wild-collected as well as laboratory-reared (at 21&#176;C) latitudinal populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> from the Indian subcontinent. We observed positive clinal variation in the wing‚Äìthorax ratio, wing aspect ratio and wing area, along a latitudinal gradient for both the sexes. In contrast, geographical changes in three parameters of flight ability, i.e. flight-muscle ratio, wing loading and dispersal, showed negative correlation with latitude. On the basis of isofemale line variability, we observed positive correlation of wing loading with flight-muscle ratio as well as dispersal behaviour in both the sexes. We also found positive correlation between duration of development and wing area. Interestingly, southern populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i> from warm and humid habitats exhibited higher flight-muscle ratio as well as the higher wing loading than northern populations which occur in cooler and drier climatic conditions. Laboratory tests for dispersal-related walking behaviour showed significantly higher values for southern populations compared with northern populations of <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Multiple regression analysis of geographical changes in flight-muscle ratio, wing loading as well as walking behaviour as a function of average temperature and relative humidity of the origin of populations in wild-collected flies have suggested adaptive changes in flight-related traits in response to steeper gradients of climatic factors in the Indian subcontinent. Finally, adaptive latitudinal variations in flight-related traits in <i>D. melanogaster</i> are consistent with results of other studies from different continents despite differences due to specific climatic conditions in the Indian subcontinent.</p>

				<title>Study of inheritance of feeding potential in natural populations of predatory coccinellid <i>Cryptolaemus montrouzieri</i> Mulsant using isofemale strains</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>The ability to feed on the prey is of great concern for the predatory insects, especially with regard to predatory coccinellid, <i>Cryptolaemus montrouzieri</i> Mulsant, which is mass reared and released into the field in large numbers to control the target pests. The variability associated with feeding potential is partly influenced by the genetic background of the insects and partly due to the environment, but the genetic basis of this trait is not yet fully understood in <i>C. montrouzieri</i>. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic basis of variation and heritability of this quantitative trait in natural populations of <i>C. montrouzieri</i> through isofemale heritability and parent‚Äìoffspring regression. The regression analyses indicated that there was a significant linear relationship between progeny and their mothers for feeding potential.</p>

				<title>A unifying study of phenotypic and molecular genetic variability in natural populations of <i>Anadenanthera colubrina</i> var. <i>cebil</i> from Yungas and Paranaense biogeographic provinces in Argentina</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0123-0132</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Anadenanthera</i> colubrina var. <i>cebil</i> is a discontinuously distributed native tree species in South American subtropical forests. Thirteen quantitative traits and eight nuclear microsatellite loci were examined in individuals from two biogeographic provinces of Argentina to determine the number and composition of genetically distinguishable groups of individuals and explore possible spatial patterns of the phenotypic and genetic variability. Means of reproductive traits were higher in the Yungas than in the Paranaense biogeographic province, whereas five out of eight nonreproductive quantitative traits showed higher mean values in the latter. Variance coefficients were moderate, and there were significant differences between and within provinces. Three clusters were defined based on spatial model for cluster membership for quantitative traits. One cluster grouped the individuals from the Paranaense biogeographic province whereas the individuals from the Yungas biogeographic province grouped regarding its population of origin. Parameters of molecular genetic variability showed higher values in the Yungas than in the Paranaense biogeographic province. Observed heterozygosity was lower than expected heterozygosity in both biogeographic provinces, indicating an excess of homozygosity. The homozygosity test by Watterson and the exact test by Slatkin suggested diversifying selection for locus <i>Ac41.1</i>. Bayesian clustering spatial model for microsatellites loci data were performed for both all loci and for all loci excluding locus <i>Ac41.1</i>. In both analyses two clusters were inferred. Analysis of molecular variance revealed similar results for all genotypes and for all genotypes defined excluding locus <i>Ac41.1</i>. Most of the total variance is attributable to genetic variation within clusters. The presence of homogeneous clusters was detected for both the phenotypic and molecular genetic variability. Two Bayesian clustering analyses were performed according to molecular genetic data, and two clusters were inferred. Individuals were assigned to their provinces of origin. Genetic molecular variation was higher in the populations of the Yungas biogeographic province which translates into highly qualified populations for conservation. Populations from the Paranaense biogeographic province showed the highest mean value of number of seeds per fruit making them valuable as well with regard to the exploitation of management strategies as a means to recover the impacted areas where these populations are located.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The application of DNA intercalator 9-aminoacridine allowed us to increase the resolution of chromosome C-banding and DAPI-banding patterns and to investigate chromosomal polymorphism in karyotypes of seven spring and six winter rape varieties. It was shown that the pericentromeric and intercalary C-bands of most of the chromosomes in spring rape were smaller in size and less polymorphic than those of winter rape. More 26S and 5S rDNA sites were found in the winter rape karyotypes than the spring varieties. Separate or colocalized 26S and 5S rDNA sites were revealed on chromosomes 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16 and 18. Intervarietal and intravarietal polymorphism of the number and chromosomal localization of rDNA sites were detected. The generalized idiogram of chromosomes of 13 <i>Brassica napus</i> varieties with account of all possibilities of C-banding patterns as well as localization of 26S and 5S rDNA sites were constructed. Polymorphism of the examined molecular and cytogenetic markers as well as the heterozygosis level of <i>FAE1.1</i> gene controlling erucic acid synthesis in rapeseed was higher in the winter varieties than in the spring ones. The obtained data were in a satisfactory agreement with increased tolerance to environmental stress conditions of winter rape.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Lignin is a major constituent of plant cell walls and indispensable to the normal growth of a plant. However, the presence of lignin complicates the structure of the plant cell walls and negatively influences pulping industry, lignocellulose utilization as well as forage properties. Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), a key enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis, catalyses the last step in monolignol synthesis and has a major role in genetic regulation of lignin production. In the present study, a 1 342-bp cDNA fragment of <i>CAD</i> gene, named <i>PpCAD</i>, was isolated from <i>Pennisetum purpureum</i> using strategies of homologous clone and rapid amplification of cDNA end. It was translated into an intact protein sequence including 366 amino acid residues by ORF Finder. The genomic full-length DNA of <i>PpCAD</i> was a 3 738-bp sequence containing four exons and three introns, among which the 114-bp exon was considered to be a conserved region compared with other <i>CADs</i>. Basic bioinformatic analysis presumed that the PpCAD was a nonsecretory and hydrophobic protein with five possible transmembrane helices. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PpCAD belonged to the class of bona fide CADs involved in lignin synthesis and it showed a high similarity (nearly 90%) with CAD protein sequences of <i>Sorghum bicolor, Panicum virgatum</i> and <i>Zea mays</i> in Gramineae. Furthere, PpCAD amino acid sequence was demonstrated to have some conserved motifs such as Zn-binding site, Zn-catalytic centre and NADP(H) binding domain after aligning with other bona fide CADs. Three-dimensional homology modelling of PpCAD showed that the protein had some exclusive features of bona fide CADs.</p>

				<title>Genetics of dioecy and causal sex chromosomes in plants</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0241-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dioecy (separate male and female individuals) ensures outcrossing and is more prevalent in animals than in plants. Although it is common in bryophytes and gymnosperms, only 5% of angiosperms are dioecious. In dioecious higher plants, flowers borne on male and female individuals are, respectively deficient in functional gynoecium and androecium. Dioecy is inherited via three sex chromosome systems: XX/XY, XX/X0 and WZ/ZZ, such that XX or WZ is female and XY, X0 or ZZ are males. The XX/XY system generates the rarer XX/X0 andWZ/ZZ systems. An autosome pair begets XY chromosomes. A recessive loss-of-androecium mutation (<i>ana</i>) creates X chromosome and a dominant gynoecium-suppressing (<i>GYS</i>) mutation creates Y chromosome. The <i>ana/ANA</i> and <i>gys/GYS</i> loci are in the sex-determining region (SDR) of the XY pair. Accumulation of inversions, deleterious mutations and repeat elements, especially transposons, in the SDR of Y suppresses recombination between X and Y in SDR, making Y labile and increasingly degenerate and heteromorphic from X. Continued recombination between X and Y in their pseudoautosomal region located at the ends of chromosomal arms allows survival of the degenerated Y and of the species. Dioecy is presumably a component of the evolutionary cycle for the origin of new species. Inbred hermaphrodite species assume dioecy. Later they suffer degenerate-Y-led population regression. Cross-hybridization between such extinguishing species and heterologous species, followed by genome duplication of segregants from hybrids, give rise to new species.</p>

				<title>Genetic controls on starch amylose content in wheat and rice grains</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0279-0292</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Starch accumulates in plants as granules in chloroplasts of source organs such as leaves (transitory starch) or in amyloplasts of sink organs such as seeds, tubers and roots (storage starch). Starch is composed of two types of glucose polymers: the essentially linear polymer amylose and highly branched amylopectin. The amylose content of wheat and rice seeds is an important quality trait, affecting the nutritional and sensory quality of two of the world‚Äôs most important crops. In this review, we focus on the relationship between amylose biosynthesis and the structure, physical behaviour and functionality of wheat and rice grains. We briefly describe the structure and composition of starch and then in more detail describe what is known about the mechanism of amylose synthesis and how the amount of amylose in starch might be controlled. This more specifically includes analysis of GBSS alleles, the relationship between waxy allelic forms and amylose, and related quantitative trait loci. Finally, different methods for increasing or lowering amylose content are evaluated.</p>

				<title>The birth and development of the DNA theory of inheritance: sixty years since the discovery of the structure of DNA</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0293-0302</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The development of the DNA theory of inheritance culminated in the publication of the molecular structure of DNA 60 years ago. This paper describes this development, beginning with the discovery of DNA as a chemical substance by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, followed by its basic chemical analysis and demonstration of its participation in the structure of chromosomes. Subsequently it was discovered by Oswald Avery in 1944 that DNA was the genetic material, and then Erwin Chargaff showed that the proportions of the bases included in the structure of DNA followed a certain law. These findings, in association with the biophysical studies of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin with Raymond Gosling, led James Watson and Francis Crick to the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA in 1953. The paper ends with a short description of the development of the DNA theory of inheritance after the discovery of the double helix.</p>

				<title>Application of RNA interference methodology to investigate and develop SCMV resistance in maize</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0305-0311</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Specific fragments of the sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) coat protein gene (<i>cp</i>) were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and used to construct a marker free small interfering RNA complex expression vector against SCMV. <i>In planta</i> transformation was performed on maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred line 8112 mediated by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>. PCR and Southern blot analyses demonstrated successful integration of the <i>cp</i> segment into the 8112 genome. The <i>in planta</i> transformation frequency was 0.1%, and the cotransformed frequency with the <i>cp</i> and <i>bar</i> genes was 0.034%. Realtime quantitative PCR of samples from different transgenic plant organs showed that the expression of the <i>cp</i> gene fragment in transgenic plants was variable and that the highest expression level occurred in the tassels and leaves and the lowest expression occurred in the roots. Real-time quantitative PCR was also used to measure how gene expression in transgenic T<sub>2</sub> generation plants inoculated with SCMV changes over time. The results showed that the hairpin RNA structure transcribed from the <i>cp</i> gene interfered with SCMV infection and transgenic maize lines were not equally effective in preventing SCMV infection. Our findings provide a valuable tool for controlling plant viruses using RNA interference and the posttranslational gene silencing approach.</p>

				<title>Phylogeny and biogeography of <i>Alyssum</i> (Brassicaceae) based on nuclear ribosomal ITS DNA sequences</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0313-0323</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The genus <i>Alyssum</i> consists of about 195 species native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa. All species were assigned to six sections. Previous molecular phylogeny studies indicate that <i>Alyssum</i> is polyphyletic. However, the divergence time and dispersal of the genus are not well studied. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus <i>Alyssum</i> were studied with nrDNA ITS sequences obtained from five sections. The divergence time was estimated by fossil calibration and the biogeography was examined by spread analysis. The phylogeny indicated two main lineages: lineage 1 includes the section of <i>Alyssum, Gamosepalum</i> and <i>Psilonema</i>; lineage 2 includes the section of <i>Odontarrhena, Meniocus</i> and <i>Clypeola</i>. The phylogenetic relationship was not congruent with the previous sectional classifications. The age of <i>Alyssum</i> was dated to the upper Miocene. Molecular data suggested the diversification of <i>Alyssum</i> in Mediterranean areas and wide-ranging distribution such as North Africa, eastward into Central Asia and immigration into North America. Climatic aridification and arid/semiarid areas established in the Pliocene/Pleistocene could have provided favourable conditions for the migration and diversification of <i>Alyssum.</i></p>

				<title>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in northern Mexico and description of a novel mutation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0325-0330</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) is the most common enzyme pathology in humans; it is X-linked inherited and causes neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, chronic nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia and drug-induced acute haemolytic anaemia. G6PD deficiency has scarcely been studied in the northern region of Mexico, which is important because of the genetic heterogeneity described in Mexican population. Therefore, samples from the northern Mexico were biochemically screened for G6PD deficiency, and PCR-RFLPs, and DNA sequencing used to identify mutations in positive samples. The frequency of G6PD deficiency in the population was 0.95% ($n = 1993$); the mutations in 86% of these samples were G6PD A<sup>-202A/376G</sup>, G6PD A<sup>-376G/968C</sup> and G6PD Santamaria<sup>376G/542T</sup>. Contrary to previous reports, we demonstrated that G6PD deficiency distribution is relatively homogenous throughout the country $(P = 0.48336)$, and the unique exception with high frequency of G6PD deficiency does not involve a coastal population (Chihuahua: 2.4%). Analysis of eight polymorphic sites showed only 10 haplotypes. In one individual we identified a new G6PD mutation named Mexico DF<sup>193A&#62;G</sup> (rs199474830), which probably results in a damaging functional effect, according to PolyPhen analysis. Proteomic impact of the mutation is also described.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Soybean isoflavones play diverse roles in human health, including cancers, osteoporosis, heart disease, menopausal symptoms and pabulums. The objective of this study was to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with the isoflavones daidzein (DC), genistein (GeC), glycitein (GlC) and total isoflavone contents (TIC) in soybean seeds. A population of 184 F<sub>2:10</sub> recombinant inbred lines derived from a ‚ÄòXiaoheidou‚Äô &#215; ‚ÄòGR8836‚Äô cross was planted in pot and field conditions to evaluate soybean isoflavones. Twenty-one QTL were detected by composite interval mapping. Several QTL were associated with the traits for DC, GeC, GlC and TIC only. <i>QDGeGlTIC4_1</i> and <i>QDGlTIC12_1</i> are reported first in this study and were associated with the DC, GeC, GlC and TIC traits simultaneously. The QTL identified have potential value for marker-assisted selection to develop soybean varieties with desirable isoflavone content.</p>

				<title>Detection of parent-of-origin effects for quantitative traits using general pedigree data</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0339-0347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genomic imprinting is a genetic phenomenon in which certain alleles are differentially expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, and plays an important role in the study of complex traits. For a diallelic marker locus in human, the parental-asymmetry tests Q-PAT(ùëê) with any constant ùëê were developed to detect parent-of-origin effects for quantitative traits. However, these methods can only be applied to deal with nuclear families and thus are not suitable for extended pedigrees. In this study, by making no assumption about the distribution of the quantitative trait, we first propose the pedigree parental-asymmetry tests Q-PPAT(ùëê) with any constant ùëê for quantitative traits to test for parent-of-origin effects based on nuclear families with complete information from general pedigree data, in the presence of association between marker alleles under study and quantitative traits. When there are any genotypes missing in pedigrees, we utilize Monte Carlo (MC) sampling and estimation and develop the Q-MCPPAT(ùëê) statistics to test for parent-of-origin effects. Various simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed methods, for different sample sizes, genotype missing rates, degrees of imprinting effects and population models. Simulation results show that the proposed methods control the size well under the null hypothesis of no parent-of-origin effects and Q-PPAT(ùëê) are robust to population stratification. In addition, the power comparison demonstrates that Q-PPAT(ùëê) and Q-MCPPAT(ùëê) for pedigree data are much more powerful than Q-PAT(ùëê) only using two-generation nuclear families selected from extended pedigrees.</p>

				<page>0349-0354</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>PprA, a pleiotropic protein involved in radioresistance of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> was detected in multiprotein DNA processing complex identified from this bacterium. <i>pprA</i> mutant expressing GFP-PprA could restore its wild type resistance of ùõæ radiation. Under normal conditions, GFP-PprA expressing cells showed PprA localization on both septum trapped nucleoids (STN) and nucleoids located elsewhere (MCN). Cell exposed to 4 kGy ùõæ radiation showed nearly 2 h growth lag and during this growth arrest phase, the majority of the cells had GFP-PprA located on MCN. While in late phase (&#8764;120 min) PIR cells, when cells are nearly out of growth arrest, PprA was maximally found with STN. These cells when treated with nalidixic acid showed diffused localization of PprA across the septum. <i>gyrA</i> disruption mutant of <i>D. radiodurans</i> showed growth inhibition, which increased further in <i>gyrA pprA</i> mutant. Interestingly, <i>gyrA</i> mutant showed &#8764;20-fold less resistance to ùõæ radiation as compared to wild type, which did increase further in <i>gyrA pprA</i> mutant. These results suggested that PprA localization undergoes a dynamic change during PIR, and its localization on nucleoid near septum and functional interaction with gyrase A might suggest a mechanism that could explain PprA role in genome segregation possibly through topoisomerase II.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Association mapping is a powerful high-resolution mapping tool for complex traits. The objective of this study was to identify QTLs for partial resistance to <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>. In this study, we evaluated a total of 214 soybean accessions by the hypocotyl inoculation method, and 175 were susceptible. The 175 susceptible accessions were then evaluated for <i>P. sojae</i> partial resistance using slant board assays. The 175 accessions were screened with 138 SSR markers that generated 730 SSR alleles. A subset of 495 SSR loci with minor allele frequency (MAF) &#8805;0.05 was used for association mapping by the Tassel general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM) programmes. This soybean population could be divided into two subpopulations and no or weak relatedness was detected between pairwise accessions. Four SSR alleles, Satt634-133, Satt634-149, Sat_222-168 and Satt301-190, associated with partial resistance to <i>P. sojae</i> were detected by both GLM and MLM methods. Of these identified markers, one marker, Satt301, was located in regions where <i>P. sojae</i> resistance QTL have been previously mapped using linkage analysis. The identified markers will help to understand the genetic basis of partial resistance, and facilitate future marker-assistant selection aimed to improve resistance to <i>P. sojae</i> and reduce disease-related mortality in soybean.</p>

				<title>Mapping of the genomic regions controlling seed storability in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0365-0370</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Seed storability is especially important in the tropics due to high temperature and relative humidity of storage environment that cause rapid deterioration of seeds in storage. The objective of this study was to use SSR markers to identify genomic regions associated with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling seed storability based on relative germination rate in the F<sub>2:3</sub> population derived from a cross between vegetable soybean line (MJ0004-6) with poor longevity and landrace cultivar from Myanmar (R18500) with good longevity. The F<sub>2:4</sub> seeds harvested in 2011 and 2012 were used to investigate seed storability. The F<sub>2</sub> population was genotyped with 148 markers and the genetic map consisted of 128 SSR loci which converged into 38 linkage groups covering 1664.3 cM of soybean genome. Single marker analysis revealed that 13 markers from six linkage groups (C1, D2, E, F, J and L) were associated with seed storability. Composite interval mapping identified a total of three QTLs on linkage groups C1, F and L with phenotypic variance explained ranging from 8.79 to 13.43%. The R18500 alleles increased seed storability at all of the detected QTLs. No common QTLs were found for storability of seeds harvested in 2011 and 2012. This study agreed with previous reports in other crops that genotype by environment interaction plays an important role in expression of seed storability.</p>

				<title>Quantitative trait loci mapping and genetic dissection for lint percentage in upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0371-0378</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lint percentage is an important character of cotton yield components and it is also correlated with cotton fibre development. In this study, we used a high lint percentage variety, Baimian1, and a low lint percentage, TM-1 genetic standard for <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>, as parents to construct a mapping populations in upland cotton (<i>G. hirsutum</i>). A quantitative trait locus/loci (QTL) analysis of lint percentage was performed by using two mapping procedures; composite interval mapping (CIM), inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) and the F<sub>2:3</sub> populations in 2 years. Six main-effect QTL (M-QTL) for lint percentage (four significant and two suggestive) were detected in both years by CIM, and were located on chr. 3, chr. 19, chr. 26 and chr. 5 /chr. 19. Of the six QTL, marker intervals and favourable gene sources of the significant M-QTL, <i>qLP-3</i>(2010) and <i>qLP-3</i>(2011) were consistent. These QTL were also detected by ICIM, and therefore, should preferentially be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of lint percentage. Another M-QTL, <i>qLP-19</i>(2010), was detected by two mapping procedures, and it could also be a candidate for MAS. We detected the interaction between two M-QTL and environment, and 11 epistatic QTL (E-QTL) and their interaction with environment by using ICIM. The study also found two EST-SSRs, NAU1187 and NAU1255, linked to M-QTL for lint percentage that could be candidate markers affecting cotton fibre development.</p>

				<title>Roles of the troponin isoforms during indirect flight muscle development in <i>Drosophila</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0379-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Troponin proteins in cooperative interaction with tropomyosin are responsible for controlling the contraction of the striated muscles in response to changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. Contractility of the muscle is determined by the constituent protein isoforms, and the isoforms can switch over from one form to another depending on physiological demands and pathological conditions. In <i>Drosophila</i>, amajority of themyofibrillar proteins in the indirect flight muscles (IFMs) undergo post-transcriptional and post-translational isoform changes during pupal to adult metamorphosis to meet the high energy and mechanical demands of flight. Using a newly generated Gal4 strain (<i>UH3-Gal4</i>) which is expressed exclusively in the IFMs, during later stages of development, we have looked at the developmental and functional importance of each of the troponin subunits (troponin-I, troponin-T and troponin-C) and their isoforms. We show that all the troponin subunits are required for normal myofibril assembly and flight, except for the troponin-C isoform 1 (TnC1). Moreover, rescue experiments conducted with troponin-I embryonic isoform in the IFMs, where flies were rendered flightless, show developmental and functional differences of TnI isoforms and importance of maintaining the right isoform.</p>

				<title>A substitution mutation in <i>OsCCD7</i> cosegregates with dwarf and increased tillering phenotype in rice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0389-0401</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Dwarf plant height and tillering ability are two of the most important agronomic traits that determine the plant architecture, and have profound influence on grain yield in rice. To understand the molecular mechanism controlling these two traits, an EMS-induced recessive <i>dwarf</i> and increased <i>tillering1</i> (<i>dit1</i>) mutant was characterized. The mutant showed proportionate reduction in each internode as compared to wild type revealing that it belonged to the category of dn-type of dwarf mutants. Besides, exogenous application of GA3 and 24-epibrassinolide, did not have any effect on the phenotype of the mutant. The gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 4, identified through positional candidate approach and verified by cosegregation analysis. It was found to encode carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase7 (CCD7) and identified as an allele of <i>htd1</i>. The mutant carried substitution of two nucleotides CC to AA in the sixth exon of the gene that resulted in substitution of serine by a stop codon in the mutant, and thus formation of a truncated protein, unlike amino acid substitution event in <i>htd1</i>. The new allele will facilitate further functional characterization of this gene, which may lead to unfolding of newer signalling pathways involving plant development and architecture.</p>

				<title>Isolation of developing secondary xylem specific cellulose synthase genes and their expression profiles during hormone signalling in <i>Eucalyptus tereticornis</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0403-0414</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cellulose synthases (<i>CesA</i>) represent a group of ùõΩ-1, 4 glycosyl transferases involved in cellulose biosynthesis. Recent reports in higher plants have revealed that two groups of <i>CesA</i> gene families exist, which are associated with either primary or secondary cell wall deposition. The present study aimed at identifying developing secondary xylem specific cellulose synthase genes from <i>Eucalyptus tereticornis</i>, a species predominantly used in paper and pulp industries in the tropics. The differential expression analysis of the three <i>EtCesA</i> genes using qRT-PCR revealed 49 to 87 fold relative expression in developing secondary xylem tissues. Three full length gene sequences of <i>EtCesA1, EtCesA2</i> and <i>EtCesA3</i> were isolated with the size of 2940, 3114 and 3123 bp, respectively. Phytohormone regulation of all three <i>EtCesA</i> genes were studied by exogenous application of gibberellic acid, naphthalene acetic acid, indole acetic acid and 2, 4-epibrassinolide in internode tissues derived from three-month-old rooted cuttings. All three <i>EtCesA</i> transcripts were upregulated by indole acetic acid and gibberellic acid. This study demonstrates that the increased cellulose deposition in the secondary wood induced by hormones can be attributed to the upregulation of xylem specific <i>CesAs.</i></p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Blast disease caused by the pathogen <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> is a serious threat to rice production. Six generations <i>viz.</i>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> of a cross between blast susceptible high-yielding rice cultivar ADT 43 and resistant near isogenic line (NIL) CT13432-3R, carrying four blast resistance genes <i>Pi1, Pi2, Pi33</i> and <i>Pi54</i> in combination were used to study the nature and magnitude of gene action for disease resistance and yield attributes. The epistatic interaction model was found adequate to explain the gene action in most of the traits. The interaction was complementary for number of productive tillers, economic yield, lesion number, infected leaf area and potential disease incidence but duplicate epistasis was observed for the remaining traits. Among the genotypes tested under epiphytotic conditions, gene pyramided lines were highly resistant to blast compared to individuals with single genes indicating that the nonallelic genes have a complementary effect when present together. The information on genetics of various contributing traits of resistance will further aid plant breeders in choosing appropriate breeding strategy for blast resistance and yield enhancement in rice.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Plant vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters play important roles in cellular ion homeostasis,vacuolar pH regulation and sequestration of Na<sup>+</sup> ions into the vacuole. Previous research showed that hydrophilic C-terminal region of <i>Arabidopsis</i> AtNHX1 negatively regulates the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporting activity. In this study, we truncated the hydrophilic C terminus of a vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter gene from <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (<i>SeNHX1</i>) to generate its derivative, <i>SeNHX1</i>-ùõ•C. Expression of SeNHX1 and SeNHX1-ùõ•C in yeast mutant showed that SeNHX1 significantly improved the tolerance to NaCl; however, the expression of SeNHX1-ùõ•C enormously decreased the tolerance to NaCl. Overall, these results suggest that the hydrophilic C-terminal region of SeNHX1 is required for Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanging activity of SeNHX1.</p>

				<title>Patterns of microsatellite evolution inferred from the <i>Helianthus annuus</i> (Asteraceae) transcriptome</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0431-0442</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The distribution of microsatellites in exons, and their association with gene ontology (GO) terms is explored to elucidate patterns of microsatellite evolution in the common sunflower, <i>Helianthus annuus</i>. The relative position, motif, size and level of impurity were estimated for each microsatellite in the unigene database available from the Compositae Genome Project (CGP), and statistical analyses were performed to determine if differences in microsatellite distributions and enrichment within certain GO terms were significant. There are more translated than untranslated microsatellites, implying that many bring about structural changes in proteins. However, the greatest density is observed within the UTRs, particularly 5&#8242;UTRs. Further, UTR microsatellites are purer and longer than coding region microsatellites. This suggests that UTR microsatellites are either younger and under more relaxed constraints, or that purifying selection limits impurities, and directional selection favours their expansion. GOs associated with response to various environmental stimuli including water deprivation and salt stress were significantly enriched with microsatellites. This may suggest that these GOs are more labile in plant genomes, or that selection has favoured the maintenance of microsatellites in these genes over others. This study shows that the distribution of transcribed microsatellites in <i>H. annuus</i> is nonrandom, the coding region microsatellites are under greater constraint compared to the UTR microsatellites, and that these sequences are enriched within genes that regulate plant responses to environmental stress and stimuli.</p>

				<title>Molecular mapping of a stripe rust resistance gene in wheat line C51</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0443-0450</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Stripe rust, a major disease in areas where cool temperatures prevail, can strongly influence grain yield. To control this disease, breeders have incorporated seedling resistance genes from a variety of sources outside the primary wheat gene pool. The wheat line C51, introduced from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Syria, confers resistance to all races of <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (PST) in China. To map the resistant gene(s) against stripe rust in wheat line C51, 212 F<sub>8</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross X440 &#215; C51 were inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR33 (Chinese yellow rust, CYR) in the greenhouse. The result showed that C51 carried a single dominant gene for resistance (designated <i>YrC51</i>) to CYR33. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and resistance gene-analogue polymorphism (RGAP) markers that were polymorphic between the parents were used for genotyping the 212 F<sub>8</sub> RILs. <i>YrC51</i> was closely linked to two SSR loci on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 5.1 cM (<i>Xgwm429</i>) and 7.2 cM (<i>Xwmc770</i>), and to three RGAP markers C51R1 (XLRR For / NLRR For), C51R2 (CLRR Rev / Cre3LR-F) and C51R3 (Pto kin4/ NLRRINV2) with genetic distances of 5.6, 1.6 and 9.2 cM, respectively. These RGAP-linked markers were then converted into STS markers.Among them, one STS marker, C51STS-4, was located at a genetic distance of 1.4 cM to <i>YrC51</i> and was closely associated with resistance when validated in several populations derived from crosses between C51 and Sichuan cultivars. The results indicated that C51STS-4 can be used for marker assisted selection (MAS) and would facilitate the pyramiding of <i>YrC51</i> with other genes for stripe rust resistance.</p>

				<title>Genetic analysis of amino acid content in wheat grain</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0451-0458</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Complete diallel crosses with five parents of common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) were conducted to analyse inheritance of 17 amino acid contents by using the genetic model including seed, cytoplasmic, maternal and environment interaction effects on quantitative traits of seeds in cereal crops. The results showed that inheritance of 17 amino acid contents, except tyrosine, was controlled by several genetic systems including seed, cytoplasmic, and maternal effects, and by significant gene &#215; environment interaction effects. Seed-direct additive and maternal effects constituted a major part of genetic effects for lysine, tyrosine, arginine, methionine, and glutamic acid content. Seed-direct additive effect formed main part in inheritance of isoleucine and serine contents. Threonine content was mainly governed by maternal additive effect. The other nine amino acid contents were almost entirely controlled by dominance effects. High general heritability of tyrosine (36.3%), arginine (45.8%), lysine (24.7%) and threonine (21.4%) contents, revealed that it could be effective to improve them by direct selection in progenies from appropriate crosses. Interaction heritability for phenylalanine, proline, and histidine content, which was 36.1%, 39.5% and 25.7%, respectively, was higher than for the other amino acids.</p>

				<title><i>LIG1</i> polymorphisms: the Indian scenario</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0459-0469</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Elucidation of the genetic diversity and relatedness of the subpopulations of India may provide a unique resource for future analysis of genetic association of several critical community-specific complex diseases.We performed a comprehensive exploration of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene DNA ligase 1 (<i>LIG1</i>) among a multiethnic panel of Indian subpopulations representative of the ethnic, linguistic and geographical diversity of India using a two-stage design involving DNA resequencing-based SNP discovery followed by SNP validation using sequenom-based genotyping. Thirty SNPs were identified in <i>LIG1</i> gene using DNA resequencing including three promoter SNPs and one coding SNP. Following SNP validation, the SNPs rs20580/C19008A and rs3730862/C8804T were found to have the most widespread prevalence with noticeable variations in minor allele frequencies both between the Indian subpopulation groups and also from those reported on other major world populations. Subsequently, SNPs found in Indian subpopulations were analysed using bioinformatics-based approaches and compared with SNP data available on major world populations. Further, we also performed genotype‚Äìphenotype association analysis of <i>LIG1</i> SNPs with publicly available data on <i>LIG1</i> mRNA expression in HapMap samples. Results showed polymorphisms in <i>LIG1</i> affect its expression and may therefore change its function. Our results stress upon the uniqueness of the Indian population with respect to the worldwide scenario and suggest that any epidemiological study undertaken on the global population should take this distinctiveness in consideration and avoid making generalized conclusions.</p>

				<title>Association of susceptible genetic markers and autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0597-0605</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of unknown aetiology resulting in inflammation of the synovium, cartilage and bone. The disease has a heterogeneous character, consisting of clinical subsets of anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive and APCA-negative disease. Although, the pathogenesis of RA is incompletely understood, genetic factors play a vital role in susceptibility to RA as the heritability of RA is between 50 and 60%, with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus accounting for at least 30% of overall genetic risk. Non-HLA genes, i.e. tumour necrosis factor-ùõº (<i>TNF</i>-ùõº) within the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) have also been investigated for association with RA. Although, some contradictory results have originated from several studies on <i>TNF</i>-ùõº gene, the data published so far indicate the possible existence of <i>TNF</i>-ùõº gene promoter variants that act as markers for disease severity and response to treatment in RA. The correlation of HLA and non-HLA genes within MHC region is apparently interpreted. A considerable number of confirmed associations with RA and other autoimmune disease susceptibility loci including peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (<i>PADI4</i>), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (<i>PTPN22</i>), signal transducer and activator of transcription (<i>STAT4</i>), cluster of differentiation 244 (<i>CD244</i>) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (<i>CTLA4</i>), located outside the MHC have been reported recently. In this review, we aim to give an update on recent progress in RA genetics, the importance of the combination of <i>HLA-DRB1</i> alleles, non-HLA gene polymorphism, its detection and autoantibodies as susceptibility markers for early RA disease.</p>

				<title>Genetic analysis to identify good combiners for ToLCV resistance and yield components in tomato using interspecific hybridization</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0623-0629</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interspecific hybridization for tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) resistance was carried out among 10 genetically diverse tomato genotypes (diversified by 50 SSR markers). Among the 10 parents, four susceptible cultivars of <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> were crossed with six resistant wilds, such as <i>S. pimpinellifolium, S. habrochaites, S. chemielewskii, S. ceraseforme, S. peruvianum</i> and <i>S. chilense</i> in a line &#215; tester mating design. All the 24 hybrids and their parents were grown in the field and glasshouse conditions to determine the general-combining abilities (GCA) and specific-combining abilities (SCA). The variances due to SCA and GCA showed both additive and nonadditive gene effects. Based on GCA estimates, EC-520061 and WIR-5032 were good general combiners while based on SCA estimates, PBC &#215; EC-520061 and PBC &#215; EC-521080 were best specific combiners for coefficient of infection and fruit yield per plant in both the environments. These lines could be selected and utilized in ToLCV resistance and high yield breeding programme for improving the traits.</p>

				<title>Complete nucleotide sequence and gene rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome of <i>Occidozyga martensii</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0631-0641</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this study, the complete nucleotide sequence (18,321 bp) of the mitochondrial (mt) genome of the round-tongued floating frog, <i>Occidozyga martensii</i> was determined. Although, the base composition and codon usage of <i>O. martensii</i> conformed to the typical vertebrate patterns, this mt genome contained 23 tRNAs (a tandem duplication of <i>tRNA-Met</i> gene). The <i>LTPF</i> tRNA-gene cluster, and the derived position of the <i>ND5</i> gene downstream of the control region, were present in this mitogenome. Moreover, we found that in the <i>WANCY</i> tRNA-gene cluster, the <i>tRNA-Asn</i> gene was located between the <i>tRNA-Tyr</i> and <i>COI</i> genes instead of between the <i>tRNA-Ala</i> and <i>tRNA-Cys</i> genes, which is a novel mtDNA gene rearrangement in vertebrates. Based on the concatenated nucleotide sequences of the 13 protein-coding genes, phylogenetic analysis (BI, ML, MP) was performed to further clarify the phylogenetic relations of this species within anurans.</p>

				<title>Mapping and introgression of QTL for yield and related traits in two backcross populations derived from <i>Oryza sativa</i> cv. Swarna and two accessions of <i>O. nivara</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0643-0654</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Advanced backcross QTL (AB-QTL) analysis was carried out in two <i>Oryza nivara</i>-derived BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> populations. For nine traits, we identified 28 QTL in population 1 and 26 QTL in population 2. The two most significant yield-enhancing QTL, <i>yldp9.1</i> and <i>yldp2.1</i> showed an additive effect of 16 and 7 g per plant in population 1, while <i>yld2.1</i> and <i>yld11.1</i> showed an additive effect of 11 and 10 g per plant in population 2. At least one <i>O. nivara</i>-derived QTL with a phenotypic variance of &#62;15% was detected for seven traits in population 1 and three traits in population 2. The <i>O. nivara</i>-derived QTL <i>ph1.1, nt12.1, nsp1.1, nfg1.1, bm11.1, yld2.1</i> and <i>yld11.1</i> were conserved at the same chromosomal locations in both populations. Two major QTL clusters were detected at the marker intervals RM488‚ÄìRM431 and RM6‚ÄìRM535 on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively. The colocation of <i>O. nivara</i>-derived yield QTL with yield meta-QTL on chromosomes 1, 2 and 9 indicates their accuracy and consistency. The major-effect QTL reported in this study are useful for marker-assisted breeding and are also suitable for further fine mapping and candidate gene identification.</p>

				<title>Identification and characterization of the <i>RCI2</i> gene family in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0655-0666</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Rare-cold-inducible (<i>RCI2</i>) genes are structurally conserved members that encode small, highly hydrophobic proteins involved in response to various abiotic stresses. Phylogenetic and functional analyses of these genes have been conducted in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but an extensive investigation of the <i>RCI2</i> gene family has not yet been carried out in maize. In the present study, 10 <i>RCI2</i> genes were identified in a fully sequenced maize genome. Structural characterization and expression pattern analysis of 10 <i>ZmRCI2</i>s (<i>Zea mays RCI2</i> genes) were subsequently determined. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that <i>ZmRCI2</i>s are highly conserved, and most of them could be grouped with their orthologues from other organisms. Chromosomal location analysis indicated that <i>ZmRCI2</i>s were distributed unevenly on seven chromosomes with two segmental duplication events, suggesting that maize <i>RCI2</i> gene family is an evolutionarily conserved family. Putative stress-responsive <i>cis</i>-elements were detected in the 2-kb promoter regions of the 10 <i>ZmRCI2</i>s. In addition, the 10 <i>ZmRCI2</i>s showed different expression patterns in maize development based on transcriptome analysis. Further, microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that each maize <i>RCI2</i> genes were responsive to drought stress, suggesting their important roles in drought stress response. The results of this work provide a basis for future cloning and application studies of maize <i>RCI2</i> genes.</p>

				<title>F<sub>1</sub> hybrids of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse strains respond differently to low-dose ionizing radiation exposure</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0667-0682</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are evidences to show that response to ionizing radiations have genetic influence. To investigate this further, reciprocal F<sub>1</sub> hybrids were genereted by crossbreeding the radiation-susceptible BALB/c mouse strain with resistant C57BL/6 in a sex-specific manner (BALB/c‚ôÇ&#215;C57BL/6‚ôÄ = B6BcF<sub>1</sub>; C57BL/6‚ôÇ&#215; BALB/c‚ôÄ =BcB6F<sub>1</sub>). These hybrids were compared with each other and to the parental strains with respect to transcriptional responses to low-dose ionizing radiation exposure (LDIR). The two F<sub>1</sub> hybrids showed drastic differences in their gene expression profiles to ionizing radiation exposure particularly in case of the genes involved in DNA damage response and repair process. Also, the inheritance pattern of the gene expression was found to be complex and could not be explained solely on the basis of parental expression pattern. It was concluded that there is a differential transmission of susceptible trait alleles from the parents to F<sub>1</sub> progeny which is dependent on the sex of the parent mouse strain used to set up the crosses and other environmental factors.</p>

				<title>Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus (<i>PSTOL1</i>) in rice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0683-0688</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Phosphate availability is a major factor limiting tillering, grain filling vis-√†-vis productivity of rice. Rice is often cultivated in soil like red and lateritic or acid, with low soluble phosphate content. To identify the best genotype suitable for these types of soils, P acquisition efficiency was estimated from 108 genotypes. Gobindabhog, Tulaipanji, Radhunipagal and Raghusail accumulated almost equal amounts of phosphate even when they were grown on P-sufficient soil. Here, we have reported the presence as well as the expression of a previously characterized rice gene, phosphate starvation tolerance locus (<i>PSTOL1</i>) in a set of selected genotypes. Two of four genotypes did not show any detectable expression but carried the gene. One mega cultivar, Swarna did not possess this gene but showed high P-deficiency tolerance ability. Increase of root biomass, not length, in P-limiting situations might be considered as one of the selecting criteria at the seedling stage. Neither the presence of <i>PSTOL1</i> gene nor its closely-linked SSR RM1261, showed any association with P-deficiency tolerance among the 108 genotypes. Not only this, but the presence of <i>PSTOL1</i> in recombinant inbred line (RIL) developed from a cross between Gobindabhog and Satabdi, also did not show any linkage with P-deficiency tolerance ability. Thus, before considering <i>PSTOL1</i> gene in MAB, its expression and role in P-deficiency tolerance in the donor parent must be ascertained.</p>

				<title>Construction of an EST-SSR-based interspecific transcriptome linkage map of fibre development in cotton</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0689-0697</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is an important method in marker-assisted selection breeding. Many studies on the QTLs focus on cotton fibre yield and quality; however, most are conducted at the DNA level, which may reveal null QTLs. Hence, QTL mapping based on transcriptome maps at the cDNA level is often more reliable. In this study, an interspecific transcriptome map of allotetraploid cotton was developed based on an F<sub>2</sub> population (Emian22 &#215; 3-79) by amplifying cDNA using EST-SSRs. The map was constructed using cDNA obtained from developing fibres at five days post anthesis (DPA). A total of 1270 EST-SSRs were screened for polymorphisms between the mapping parents. The resulting transcriptome linkage map contained 242 markers that were distributed in 32 linkage groups (26 chromosomes). The full length of this map is 1938.72 cM with a mean marker distance of 8.01 cM. The functions of some ESTs have been annotated by exploring homologous sequences. Some markers were related to the differentiation and elongation of cotton fibre, while most were related to the basic metabolism. This study demonstrates that constructing a transcriptome linkage map by amplifying cDNAs using EST-SSRs is a simple and practical method as well as a powerful tool to map eQTLs for fibre quality and other traits in cotton.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>

				<abstract>
					<p>Mitochondrial genomes have proved to be powerful tools in resolving phylogenetic relationships. <i>Emberiza chrysophrys</i> (least concern species: IUCN 2013) is a passerine bird in the bunting family, Emberizidae. The complete mitochondrial genome of <i>E. chrysophrys</i> was sequenced. This circular mitochondrial genome was 16,803 bp in length, with an A+T content of 52.26%, containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and a putative control region (CR). The CR of <i>E. chrysophrys</i> was divided into three conserved domains. Six conserved sequence boxes in the central conserved domain II were identified as F, E, D, C, b and B. An obvious positive AT-skew and negative GC-skew bias were found for all 28 genes encoded by the H strand, whereas it was the reverse in the remaining nine genes encoded by the L strand. Remarkable rate heterogeneity was present in the mitochondrial genome of <i>E. chrysophrys</i>. Notably, unusual slow rate of evolution in the mitochondrial CR of <i>E. chrysophrys</i> was detected, which is rarely seen in other birds. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out based on 13 PCGs that showed <i>E. pusilla</i> was the sister group of <i>E. rustica</i>, and the monophyly of <i>Emberiza</i> was established.</p>

				<title>Expression of the <i>rgMT</i> gene, encoding for a rice metallothionein-like protein in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0709-0718</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Metallothioneins (MTs) are cysteine-rich proteins of low molecular weight with many attributed functions, such as providing protection against metal toxicity, being involved in regulation of metal ions uptake that can impact plant physiology and providing protection against oxidative stress. However, the precise function of the metallothionein-like proteins such as the one coded for <i>rgMT</i> gene isolated from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) is not completely understood. The whole genome analysis of rice (<i>O. sativa</i>) showed that the <i>rgMT</i> gene is homologue to the Os11g47809 on chromosome 11 of <i>O. sativa</i> sp. <i>japonica</i> genome. This study used the <i>rgMT</i> coding sequence to create transgenic lines to investigate the subcellular localization of the protein, as well as the impact of gene expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> under heavy metal ion, salt and oxidative stresses. The results indicate that the <i>rgMT</i> gene was expressed in the cytoplasm of transgenic cells. Yeast cells transgenic for <i>rgMT</i> showed vigorous growth compared to the nontransgenic controls when exposed to 7mM CuCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM FeCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 M NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 3.2 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but there was no significant difference for other stresses tested. Similarly, <i>Arabidopsis</i> transgenic for <i>rgMT</i> displayed significantly improved seed germination rates over that of the control when the seeds were stressed with 100 ùúáM CuCl<sub>2</sub> or 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Increased biomass was observed in the presence of 100 ùúáM CuCl<sub>2</sub>, 220 ùúáM FeCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These results indicate that the expression of the rice <i>rgMT</i> gene in transgenic yeast and <i>Arabidopsis</i> is implicated in improving their tolerance for certain salt and peroxide stressors.</p>

				<title>Association of <i>PPARùõæ</i> gene polymorphisms with osteoarthritis in a southeast Chinese population</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0719-0723</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in developed countries. Currently no satisfactory treatment to stop disease progression exists. Recent studies suggest that activation of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARùõæ) is an interesting therapeutic target for this disease. PPARùõæ is a transcription factor important for adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation. Agonists of PPARùõæ inhibit inflammation and reduce generation of cartilage degradation products both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and reduce the development/progression of cartilage lesions in OA animal models. However, there are no studies to assess the role of PPARùõæ in OA susceptibility of human peripheral joints in a Chinese population. We conducted a case‚Äìcontrol study in a southeast Chinese population to determine the association of <i>PPAR</i>ùõæ gene polymorphisms (rs1801282, rs12629751, rs2292101, rs4135275 and rs1175543) with OA. One-hundred knee OA cases and 100 controls were studied. Statistically significant differences were detected in genotype and allele frequencies between OA and control groups in this population. For knee OA, the highest risk was associated with the variant allele T of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12629751 (odds ratio (OR): 0.341, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.173‚Äì0.673, $P = 0.002$), and allele T of SNP rs12629751 (chi-square: 9.546, $P = 0.002$) could be considered as a risk factor of knee OA. Therefore, <i>PPAR</i>ùõæ mutation could be associated with the incidence of OA in a Chinese population. There is a significant association between the <i>PPAR</i>ùõæ polymorphism rs12629751 and susceptibility to knee OA in a southeast Chinese population.</p>

				<title>Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of ùõº-gliadin gene sequences reveals significant genomic divergence in Triticeae species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0725-0731</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Although the unique properties of wheat ùõº-gliadin gene family are well characterized, little is known about the evolution and genomic divergence of ùõº-gliadin gene family within the Triticeae. We isolated a total of 203 ùõº-gliadin gene sequences from 11 representative diploid and polyploid Triticeae species, and found 108 sequences putatively functional. Our results indicate that ùõº-gliadin genes may have possibly originated from wild <i>Secale</i> species, where the sequences contain the shortest repetitive domains and display minimum variation. A miniature inverted-repeat transposable element insertion is reported for the first time in ùõº-gliadin gene sequence of <i>Thinopyrum intermedium</i> in this study, indicating that the transposable element might have contributed to the diversification of ùõº-gliadin genes family among Triticeae genomes. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ùõº-gliadin gene sequences of <i>Dasypyrum, Australopyrum, Lophopyrum, Eremopyrum</i> and <i>Pseudoroengeria</i> species have amplified several times. A search for four typical toxic epitopes for celiac disease within the Triticeae ùõº-gliadin gene sequences showed that the ùõº-gliadins of wild <i>Secale, Australopyrum</i> and <i>Agropyron</i> genomes lack all four epitopes, while other Triticeae species have accumulated these epitopes, suggesting that the evolution of these toxic epitopes sequences occurred during the course of speciation, domestication or polyploidization of Triticeae.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0733-0746</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Teosinte branched1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor1 (TCP) proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators in angiosperms. They are involved in various biological processes, including development and plant metabolism pathways. In this study, a total of 52 <i>TCP</i> genes were identified in apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) genome. Bioinformatic methods were employed to predicate and analyse their relevant gene classification, gene structure, chromosome location, sequence alignment and conserved domains of MdTCP proteins. Expression analysis from microarray data showed that the expression levels of 28 and 51 <i>MdTCP</i> genes changed during the ripening and rootstock‚Äìscion interaction processes, respectively. The expression patterns of 12 selected <i>MdTCP</i> genes were analysed in different tissues and in response to abiotic stresses. All of the selected genes were detected in at least one of the tissues tested, and most of them were modulated by adverse treatments indicating that the <i>MdTCP</i>s were involved in various developmental and physiological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of a genomewide analysis of apple <i>TCP</i> gene family. These results provide valuable information for studies on functions of the <i>TCP</i> transcription factor genes in apple.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>14-3-3 proteins play important roles in regulating plant development and phytohormone (abscisic acid, gibberellin and brassinosteroids) signalling. However, their regulation in fruit ripening and senescense, and response to salicylic acid and ethylene signalling are yet to be illustrated. One cDNA encoding putative 14-3-3 protein was isolated from pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i>) and designated <i>Pp14-3-3a</i>. Phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that Pp14-3-3a belonged to ùúñ-like group of 14-3-3 super-families. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that the expression of <i>Pp14-3-3a</i> gene was developmentally regulated in the fruit. Further study demonstrated that <i>Pp14-3-3a</i> expression was inhibited by salicylic acid and induced by ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid in pear fruit. These data suggested that <i>Pp14-3-3a</i> might be involved in response to salicylic acid and ethylene signalling during fruit ripening and senescence of pear.</p>

				<title>Positive selection in the leucine-rich repeat domain of <i>Gro1</i> genes in <i>Solanum</i> species</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0755-0765</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In pathogen resistant plants, solvent-exposed residues in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins are thought to mediate resistance by recognizing plant pathogen elicitors. In potato, the gene <i>Gro1-4</i> confers resistance to <i>Globodera rostochiensis</i>. The investigation of variablity in different copies of this gene represents a good model for the verification of positive selection mechanisms. Two datasets of <i>Gro1</i> LRR sequences were constructed, one derived from the <i>Gro1-4</i> gene, belonging to different cultivated and wild <i>Solanum</i> species, and the other belonging to paralogues of a resistant genotype. Analysis of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates $(K_{a}/K_{s})$ highlighted 14 and six amino acids with $K_{a}/K_{s} \gt 1$ in orthologue and paralogue datasets, respectively. Selection analysis revealed that the leucine-rich regions accumulate variability in a very specific way, and we found that some combinations of amino acids in these sites might be involved in pathogen recognition. The results confirm previous studies on positive selection in the LRR domain of R protein in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and other model plants and extend these to wild <i>Solanum</i> species. Moreover, positively selected sites in the <i>Gro1</i> LRR domain show that coevolution mainly occurred in two regions on the internal surface of the three-dimensional horseshoe structure of the domain, albeit with different evolutionary forces between paralogues and orthologues.</p>

				<title>Comparative analysis of <i>ADS</i> gene promoter in seven <i>Artemisia</i> species</title>
				<feature>Reseach Article</feature>
				<page>0767-0774</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Artemisinin is the most effective antimalarial drug that is derived from <i>Artemisia annua</i>. Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) controls the first committed step in artemisinin biosynthesis. The <i>ADS</i> gene expression is regulated by transcription factors which bind to the <i>cis</i>-acting elements on the ADS promoter and are probably responsible for the <i>ADS</i> gene expression difference in the <i>Artemisia</i> species. To identify the elements that are significantly involved in <i>ADS</i> gene expression, the <i>ADS</i> gene promoter of the seven <i>Artemisia</i> species was isolated and comparative analysis was performed on the ADS promoter sequences of these species. Results revealed that some of the <i>cis</i>-elements were unique or in terms of number were more in the high artemisinin producer species, <i>A. annua</i>, than the other species. We have reported that the light-responsive elements, W-box, CAAT-box, 5&#8242;-UTR py-rich stretch, TATA-box sequence and tandem repeat sequences have been identified as important factors in the increased expression of <i>ADS</i> gene.</p>

				<title>Population structure and association mapping studies for important agronomic traits in soybean</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0775-0784</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The present study was carried out with a set of 96 diverse soybean genotypes with the objectives of analysing the population structure and to identify molecular markers associated with important agronomic traits. Large phenotypic variability was observed for the agronomic traits under study indicating suitability of the genotypes for association studies. The maximum values for plant height, pods per plant, seeds per pod, 100-seed weight and seed yield per plant were approximately two and half to three times more than the minimum values for the genotypes. Seed yield per plant was found to be significantly correlated with pods per plant ($r = 0.77$), 100-seed weight ($r = 0.35$) and days to maturity ($r = 0.23$). The population structure studies depicted the presence of seven subpopulations which nearly corresponded with the source of geographical origin of the genotypes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the linked markers decreased with the increased distance, and a substantial drop in LD decay values was observed between 30 and 35 cM. Genomewide marker-traits association analysis carried out using general linear (GLM) and mixed linear models (MLM) identified six genomic regions (two of them were common in both) on chromosomes 6, 7, 8, 13, 15 and 17, which were found to be significantly associated with various important traits <i>viz.</i>, plant height, pods per plant, 100-seed weight, plant growth habit, average number of seeds per pod, days to 50% flowering and days to maturity. The phenotypic variation explained by these loci ranged from 6.09 to 13.18% and 4.25 to 9.01% in the GLM and MLM studies, respectively. In conclusion, association mapping (AM) in soybean could be a viable alternative to conventional QTL mapping approach.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0785-0797</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Auxin response factors (ARF) are transcription factors that regulate auxin responses in plants. Although the genomewide analysis of this family has been performed in some species, little is known regarding ARF genes in apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>). In this study, 31 putative apple ARF genes have been identified and located within the apple genome. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that MdARFs could be divided into three subfamilies (groups I, II and III). The predicted MdARFs were distributed across 15 of 17 chromosomes with different densities. In addition, the analysis of exon‚Äìintron junctions and of the intron phase inside the predicted coding region of each candidate gene has revealed high levels of conservation within and between phylogenetic groups. Expression profile analyses of MdARF genes were performed in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, flower and fruit), and all the selected genes were expressed in at least one of the tissues that were tested, which indicated that MdARFs are involved in various aspects of physiological and developmental processes of apple. To our knowledge, this report is the first to provide a genomewide analysis of the apple ARF gene family. This study provides valuable information for understanding the classification and putative functions of the ARF signal in apple.</p>

				<title>Aldosterone synthase C-344T, angiotensin II type 1 receptor A1166C and 11-ùõΩ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase G534A gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension in the population of Odisha, India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0799-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Essential hypertension which accounts 90‚Äì95% of the total hypertension cases is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. This study was undertaken to investigate the association of aldosterone synthase C-344T, angiotensin II type I receptor A1166C and 11-ùõΩ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 G534A polymorphisms with essential hypertension in the population of Odisha, India. A total of 246 hypertensive subjects (males, 159; females, 87) and 274 normal healthy individuals (males, 158; females, 116) were enrolled in this study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Analysis of genetic and biochemical data revealed that in this population the CT and TT genotypes of aldosterone synthase C-344T polymorphism, frequency of alcohol consumption and aldosterone levels were significantly high among the total as well as male hypertensives, while the AC and CC genotypes of angiotensin II type I receptor A1166C polymorphism were significantly high among the total as well as female hypertensives. High density lipoprotein levels were higher in male hypertensives.</p>

				<title>Molecular and genetic basis of depression</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0879-0892</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Joyousness or sadness is normal reaction to state of life. If any of these lead to certain semi-permanent changes in daily life, then it is termed as mental disorder. Depression is one of the mental disorders with a state of low mood and aversion to activities that exerts a negative effect on a person‚Äôs thoughts and behaviour. Adolescent group is probably the world‚Äôs largest active group of people, who are getting prone to this state of mind leading to their diminished mental and physical abilities. Depression is closely linked to stress and thus a chronic stressful life can increase the risk of depression. Depression is a complex disease having both genetic and environmental components as contributing factors. In this study an attempt has been made to put forward the understanding of the known genes and their functional relationships with depression and stress with special reference to <i>BDNF</i> and <i>5-HTTLPR</i>. Analysis of common genetic variants associated with depression, especially in the members of a family who had a previous history, might help in identifying the individuals at risk prior to the onset of depression.</p>

				<title>Genetic basis of interindividual susceptibility to cancer cachexia: selection of potential candidate gene polymorphisms for association studies</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0893-0916</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Cancer cachexia is a complex and multifactorial disease. Evolving definitions highlight the fact that a diverse range of biological processes contribute to cancer cachexia. Part of the variation in who will and who will not develop cancer cachexia may be genetically determined. As new definitions, classifications and biological targets continue to evolve, there is a need for reappraisal of the literature for future candidate association studies. This review summarizes genes identified or implicated as well as putative candidate genes contributing to cachexia, identified through diverse technology platforms and model systems to further guide association studies. A systematic search covering 1986‚Äì2012 was performed for potential candidate genes / genetic polymorphisms relating to cancer cachexia. All candidate genes were reviewed for functional polymorphisms or clinically significant polymorphisms associated with cachexia using the OMIM and GeneRIF databases. Pathway analysis software was used to reveal possible network associations between genes. Functionality of SNPs/genes was explored based on published literature, algorithms for detecting putative deleterious SNPs and interrogating the database for expression of quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). A total of 154 genes associated with cancer cachexia were identified and explored for functional polymorphisms. Of these 154 genes, 119 had a combined total of 281 polymorphisms with functional and/or clinical significance in terms of cachexia associated with them. Of these, 80 polymorphisms (in 51 genes) were replicated in more than one study with 24 polymorphisms found to influence two or more hallmarks of cachexia (i.e., inflammation, loss of fat mass and/or lean mass and reduced survival). Selection of candidate genes and polymorphisms is a key element of multigene study design. The present study provides a contemporary basis to select genes and/or polymorphisms for further association studies in cancer cachexia, and to develop their potential as susceptibility biomarkers of cachexia.</p>

				<title>Genetic variability of <i>CYP2C19</i> in a Mexican population: contribution to the knowledge of the inheritance pattern of <i>CYP2C19*17</i> to develop the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0003-0007</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>CYP2C19 is a polymorphic enzyme that metabolizes a wide variety of therapeutic drugs that has been associated with altered enzymatic activity and adverse drug reactions. Differences in allele frequencies of the <i>CYP2C19</i> gene have been detected in populations worldwide. Thus, we analysed the alleles <i>CYP2C19*2</i>, <i>CYP2C19*3</i>, <i>CYP2C19*4</i> and <i>CYP2C19*5</i> related to the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype in a Mexican population sample (ùëõ = 238), as well as <i>CYP2C19*17</i>, unique allele related to ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype (UMs). Genotypes were determined using SNaPshot and TaqManqPCR assays. In addition to the wild-type <i>CYP2C19*1</i> allele (77.1%), we only found <i>CYP2C19*17</i> (14.3%) and <i>CYP2C19*2</i> (8.6%). Comparison with previous population reports demonstrated that these two SNPs are homogeneously distributed in Latin America (ùëÉ &gt; 0.05). Based on comparison with a previous pharmacokinetic study that determined the frequency of CYP2C19 phenotypes in the same population (western Mexican), we obtained the following findings: (i) based on the difference between the frequency of genotypes <i>CYP2C19*2/*2</i> (presumably PM) versus the observed prevalence of PM phenotypes (0.4 versus 6.3%; ùúí<sup>2</sup> = 9.58, ùëÉ = 0.00196), we inferred the plausible presence of novel <i>CYP2C19</i> alleles related to the PM phenotype; (ii) the prevalence of UMs was in disagreement with the dominant inheritance pattern suggested for <i>CYP2C19*17</i> (23.1 versus 4%; ùëÉ &lt; 0.00001); (iii) the apparent recessive inheritance pattern of <i>CYP2C19*17</i>, based on the agreement between homozygous <i>CYP2C19*17/*17</i> (presumably UMs) and the observed prevalence of UMs (2.1 versus 4%; (ùúí<sup>2</sup> = 1.048; ùëÉ = 0.306).</p>

				<title>Genetic analysis of fertility restoration under CGMS system in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) using three-way test-cross method</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0009-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We studied the genetics of fertility restoration by producing three-way test cross (TWTC) hybrids involved different combinations of restorers, maintainers and partial restorers of rice. Pollen and spikelet fertility of 16 TWTC hybrids were studied. Six TWTC involving restorer/restorer combinations as male parents produced progenies with fertility levels ranging from complete to zero. No specific ratio of segregation was observed. The crosses involving maintainer/maintainer combinations as male parents showed fully fertile and partial fertile/sterile plants in their progenies. These could be due to nonallelic gene interactions for fertility restoration between the two restorer or maintainer parents, or due to the influence of some modifying genes in the nuclear genome. TWTC involving partial restorer / restorer and partial restorer/partial restorer as the male parents also produced fully fertile and partial fertile/sterile plants suggesting the complex genetics of fertility restoration in rice. There were no previous results depicting the complementation effects of maintainers for fertility restoration.</p>

				<title>Distinct patterns of epigenetic marks and transcription factor binding sites across promoters of sense-intronic long noncoding RNAs</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0017-0025</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new class of noncoding RNAs that have been extensively studied in the recent past as a regulator of gene expression, including modulation of epigenetic regulation. The lncRNAs class encompasses a number of subclasses, classified based on their genomic loci and relation to protein-coding genes. Functional differences between subclasses have been increasingly studied in the recent years, though the regulation of expression and biogenesis of lncRNAs have been poorly studied. The availability of genome-scale datasets of epigenetic marks has motivated us to understand the patterns and processes of epigenetic regulation of lncRNAs. Here we analysed the occurrence of expressive and repressive histone marks at the transcription start site (TSS) of lncRNAs and their subclasses, and compared these profiles with that of the protein-coding regions. We observe distinct differences in the density of histone marks across the TSS of a few lncRNA subclasses. The sense-intronic lncRNA subclass showed a paucity for mapped histone marks across the TSS which were significantly different than all the lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in most cases. Similar pattern was also observed for the density of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). These observations were generally consistent across cell and tissue types. The differences in density across the promoter were significantly associated with the expression level of the genes, but the differences between the densities across long noncoding and protein-coding gene promoters were consistent irrespective of the expression levels. Apart from suggesting general differences in epigenetic regulatory marks across long noncoding RNA promoters, our analysis suggests a possible alternative mechanism of regulation and/or biogenesis of sense-intronic lncRNAs.</p>

				<title>Simultaneous estimation of QTL effects and positions when using genotype data with errors</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0027-0034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Accurate genetic data are important prerequisite of performing genetic linkage test or association test. Currently, most analytical methods assume that the observed genotypes are correct. However, due to the constraint at the technical level, most of the genetic data that people used so far contain errors. In this paper, we considered the problem of QTL mapping based on biological data with genotyping errors. By analysing all possible genotypes of each individual in framework of multiple-interval mapping, we proposed an algorithm of inferring all model parameters through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and discussed the hypothesis testing of the existence of QTL. We carried out extensive simulation studies to assess the proposed method. Simulation results showed that the new method outperforms the method that does not take the genotyping errors into account, and therefore it can decrease the impact of genotyping errors on QTL mapping. The proposed method was also applied to analyse a real barley dataset.</p>

				<title>Distribution of genes associated with yield potential and water-saving in Chinese Zone II wheat detected by developed functional markers</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0035-0042</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Functional markers (FMs) developed from sequence polymorphisms are present in allelic variants of a functional gene at a locus and are directly associated with phenotypic variations. In this study, FM linked to <i>Rht-B1, Rht-D1, TaCwi-A1, TaSus2-2B, TaGW2-6A</i> and <i>Dreb-B1</i> genes conferring to yield potential and water-saving were selected to analyse the distribution in 102 wheat varieties, most of which were authorized in the past decade and adapted to grow in Zone II of China. First, the semi-dwarfing genes <i>Rht-B1b</i> and <i>Rht-D1b</i> (mutant alleles) conferring to grain yield were analysed. The frequencies of favourable alleles <i>Rht-B1b</i> and <i>Rht-D1b</i> were 32.4 and 58.8%, respectively. Comparing with the previous report, the frequency of <i>Rht-B1b</i> among cultivars in this study is similar to the frequency among cultivars released in the 1990s, while the frequency of <i>Rht-D1b</i> is slightly lower than the previous report 63.9%. Twelve (11.8%) cultivars neither contained <i>Rht-B1b</i> nor <i>Rht-D1b</i>, while only Yumai 66 contained both semidwarfing genes. Linyuan8 and Xinong 928 are heterozygous at <i>RhtB1</i> locus and Zhengmai 9023 is heterozygous at both <i>RhtB1</i> and <i>Rht-D1</i> loci. Second, the <i>TaCwi-A1</i>, <i>TaSus2-2B</i> and <i>TaGW2-6A</i> genes considered as candidate genes related to grain weight were detected. We found that the frequencies of the favourable alleles were 76.5, 56.9 and 69.6%, respectively. Among the 102 wheat varieties, 30 contained all the three favourable genes, 45 contained two of the three favourable genes and 27 contained only one. There are eight wheat varieties (7.8%) in hybrid state at the <i>TaCWI-A1</i> locus. Third, the designed FM linked to water-saving gene <i>Dreb-B1</i> were validated on 102 wheat varieties. The results showed that the haplotypes of 47 wheat varieties at the <i>Dreb-B1</i> locus were same as that of Opata 85, and 55 wheat varieties showed the signal expected for W7984 (Opata 85 and W7984 are parents of the ITMI mapping population). This information will be useful for the wheat breeding programmes aiming at improving yield and water use efficiency in Shijiazhuang located in China Zone II.</p>

				<title>Inbreeding in stochastic subdivided mating systems: the genetic consequences of host spatial structure, aggregated transmission dynamics and life history characteristics in parasite populations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0043-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inbreeding in parasite populations can have important epidemiological and evolutionary implications. However, theoretical models have predominantly focussed on the evolution of parasite populations under strong selection or in epidemic situations, and our understanding of neutral gene dynamics in parasite populations at equilibrium has been limited to verbal arguments or conceptual models. This study focusses on how host‚Äìparasite population dynamics affects observed levels of inbreeding in a random sample of parasites from an infinite population of hosts by bridging traditional genetic and parasitological processes utilizing a backward‚Äìforward branching Markov process embedded within a flexible statistical framework, the logarithmic-poisson mixture model. My results indicate that levels of inbreeding in parasites are impacted by demographic and/or transmission dynamics (subdivided mating, aggregated transmission dynamics and host spatial structure), and that this inbreeding is poorly estimated by ‚Äòequilibrium‚Äô levels of inbreeding calculated assuming regular systems of mating. Specifically, the model reveals that at low levels of inbreeding (ùêπ &#8804; 0.1), equilibrium levels of inbreeding are lower than those observed, while at high levels of inbreeding the opposite pattern occurs. The model also indicates that inbreeding could have important epidemiological implications (e.g., the spread of recessive drug resistance genes) by directly impacting the observed frequency of rare homozygotes in parasite populations. My results indicate that frequencies of rare homozygotes are affected by aggregated transmission dynamics and host spatial structure, and also that an increase in the frequency of rare homozygotes can be caused by a decrease in effective population size solely due to the presence of a subdivided breeding system.</p>

				<title>Identification of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene family in winter wheat and expression analysis under conditions of freezing stress</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0055-0065</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Trehalose contents are potentially modulated by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), which is a key enzyme in the trehalose biosynthetic pathway. Using available wheat expressed sequence tag sequence information from NCBI and two wheat genome databases, we identified 12 wheat <i>TPS</i> genes and performed a comprehensive study on their structural, evolutionary and functional properties. The estimated divergence time of wheat <i>TPS</i> gene pairs and wheat‚Äìrice orthologues suggested that wheat and rice have a common ancestor. The number of <i>TPS</i> genes in the wheat genome was estimated to be at least 12, which is close to the number found in rice, <i>Arabidopsis</i> and soybean. Moreover, it has been reported earlier in other plants that <i>TPS</i> genes respond to abiotic stress, however, our study mainly analysed the <i>TPS</i> gene family under freezing conditions in winter wheat, and determined that most of the <i>TPS</i> gene expression in winter wheat was induced by freezing conditions, which further suggested that wheat <i>TPS</i> genes were involved in winter wheat freeze-resistance signal transduction pathways. Taken together, the current study represents the first comprehensive study of <i>TPS</i> genes in winter wheat and provides a foundation for future functional studies of this important gene family in Triticeae.</p>

				<title>Characterization and fine mapping of a female fertility associated gene <i>Ff1(t)</i> in rice</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0067-0073</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Female-sterile line can be used as a pollinator which has a great potential for hybrid seeds production. However, reports on female fertility are fewer than male fertility. Here, we characterized a recessive female fertility weakening mutant <i>ff1(t)</i> from rice. The spikelet fertility was seriously affected in the mutant. Reciprocal crosses and pollen vitality assay suggest that the decreased fertility was caused by the defective female gametophytes. Further investigation indicated that the mutant ovary development was inhibited before fertilization and failed swelling after flowering. Genetic analysis and fine mapping showed that the mutant was controlled by a single recessive gene, residing on a 16.8 kb region on the long arm of chromosome 1. The gene annotation indicated that there was only one putative gene encoding lysine decarboxylase-like protein in this region, which was allelic to <i>LOG</i>. Further, the sequence analysis was carried out and a substitution at the splice site of intron 2 / exon 3 was revealed in <i>ff1(t)</i> mutant, resulting in the change of reading frame. The finding of novel allele of <i>LOG</i> locus will facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms of female gametophyte development.</p>

				<title>The effect of high glucose levels on the hypermethylation of protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3C (PPP1R3C) gene in colorectal cancer</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0075-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic event that occurs frequently in colorectal cancer (CRC). Increased glucose level is a strong risk factor for CRC. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3C (<i>PPP1R3C</i>) modulates glycogen metabolism, particularly glycogen synthesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high glucose levels on DNA methylation of <i>PPP1R3C</i> in CRC. <i>PPP1R3C</i> was significantly hypermethylated in CRC tissues (76/105, 72.38%, ùëÉ &lt; 0.05) and colon cancer cell lines (ùëÉ &lt; 0.05). CRC tissues obtained from patients with high glucose levels showed that the methylation of <i>PPP1R3C</i> was lower than in patients who had normal levels of glucose. When DLD-1 cells were cultured under conditions of high glucose, the methylation of <i>PPP1R3C</i> was repressed. The expression of <i>PPP1R3C</i> was inversely related to methylation status. In addition, a promoter luciferase assay showed that the transcriptional activity of <i>PPP1R3C</i> was increased in high glucose culture conditions. The number of cells decreased when <i>PPP1R3C</i> was silenced in DLD-1 cells. These results suggest that <i>PPP1R3C</i>, a novel hypermethylated gene in CRC, may play a critical role in cancer cell growth in association with glucose levels.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Cottonseed contains 16% seed oil and 23% seed protein by weight. High levels of palmitic acid provides a degree of stability to the oil, while the presence of bound gossypol in proteins considerably changes their properties, including their biological value. This study uses genetic principles to identify genomic regions associated with seed oil, protein and fibre content in upland cotton cultivars. Cotton association mapping panel representing the US germplasm were genotyped using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, yielding 234 polymorphic DNA fragments. Phenotypic analysis showed high genetic variability for the seed traits, seed oil range from 6.47‚Äì25.16%, protein from 1.85‚Äì28.45% and fibre content from 15.88‚Äì37.12%. There were negative correlations between seed oil and protein content. With reference to genetic diversity, the average estimate of ùêπ<sub>ST</sub> was 8.852 indicating a low level of genetic differentiation among subpopulations. The AMOVA test revealed that variation was 94% within and 6% among subpopulations. Bayesian population structure identified five subpopulations and was in agreement with their geographical distribution. Among the mixed models analysed, mixed linear model (MLM) identified 21 quantitative trait loci for lint percentage and seed quality traits, such as seed protein and oil. Establishing genetic diversity, population structure and marker trait associations for the seed quality traits could be valuable in understanding the genetic relationships and their utilization in breeding programmes.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0095-0104</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As one of the three macronutrients, potassium participates in many physiological processes in plant life cycle. Recently, potassium-dependent transcriptome analysis has been reported in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, rice and soybean. Alligator weed is well known, particularly for its strong ability to accumulate potassium. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies potassium starvation responses has not yet been described. In this study, we used Illumina (Solexa) sequencing technology to analyse the root transcriptome information of alligator weed under low potassium stress. Further analysis suggested that 9253 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, and 2138 DEGs were downregulated after seven days of potassium deficiency. These factors included 121 transcription factors, 108 kinases, 136 transporters and 178 genes that were related to stress. Twelve transcription factors were randomly selected for further analysis. The expression level of each transcription factor was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, and the results of this secondary analysis were consistent with the results of Solexa sequencing. Enrichment analysis indicated that 10,993 DEGs were assigned to 54 gene ontology terms and 123 KEGG pathways. Approximately 24% of DEGs belong to the metabolic, ribosome and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite KEGG pathways. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the gene regulatory network of alligator weed under low potassium stress, and afford a valuable resource for genetic and genomic research on plant potassium deficiency.</p>

				<title>Comparative analyses of genetic risk prediction methods reveal extreme diversity of genetic predisposition to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among ethnic populations of India</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0105-0113</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a distinct pathologic condition characterized by a disease spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to steato-hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Prevalence of NAFLD varies in different ethnic groups, ranging from 12% in Chinese to 45% in Hispanics. Among Indian populations, the diversity in prevalence is high, ranging from 9% in rural populations to 32% in urban populations, with geographic differences as well. Here, we wished to find out if this difference is reflected in their genetic makeup. To date, several candidate genes and a few genomewide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out, and many associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and NAFLD have been observed. In this study, the risk allele frequencies (RAFs) of NAFLD-associated SNPs in 20 Indian ethnic populations (376 individuals) were analysed. We used two different measures for calculating genetic risk scores and compared their performance. The correlation of additive risk scores of NAFLD for three Hapmap populations with their weighted mean prevalence was found to be high (ùëÖ<sup>2</sup> = 0.93). Later we used this method to compare NAFLD risk among ethnic Indian populations. Based on our observation, the Indian caste populations have high risk scores compared to Caucasians, who are often used as surrogate and similar to Indian caste population in disease gene association studies, and is significantly higher than the Indian tribal populations.</p>

				<title>A comparison of biological and cultural evolution</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0155-0168</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This review begins with a definition of biological evolution and a description of its general principles. This is followed by a presentation of the biological basis of culture, specifically the concept of social selection. Further, conditions for cultural evolution are proposed, including a suggestion for language being the cultural replicator corresponding to the concept of the gene in biological evolution. Principles of cultural evolution are put forward and compared to the principles of biological evolution. Special emphasis is laid on the principle of selection in cultural evolution, including presentation of the concept of cultural fitness. The importance of language as a necessary condition for cultural evolution is stressed. Subsequently, prime differences between biological and cultural evolution are presented, followed by a discussion on interaction of our genome and our culture. The review aims at contributing to the present discussion concerning the modern development of the general theory of evolution, for example by giving a tentative formulation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for cultural evolution, and proposing that human creativity and mind reading or theory of mind are motors specific for it. The paper ends with the notion of the still ongoing coevolution of genes and culture.</p>

				<title>Isolation of a minireplicon of the plasmid pG6303 of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> G63 and characterization of the plasmid-encoded Rep replication protein</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0177-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A cryptic 10.0-kb plasmid pG6303 from a multiplasmid-containing <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> G63 was studied. The analysis of replicon was facilitated by the construction of shuttle vectors and electrotransformation into <i>L. plantarum</i>. The pG6303 replicon included (i) an open reading frame encoding the putative Rep replication initiation protein; and (ii) the putative origin of replication. The Rep protein was expressed as a fusion with the hexa-histidine (His) at its C-terminal end and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays in pG6303 showed that the purified Rep protein specifically bound from 5582 to 5945 bp, differing from the putative origin of replication of pG6303. We speculate that pG6303 replication is a new mode of plasmid replication.</p>

				<title>Evaluation of random forest regression for prediction of breeding value from genomewide SNPs</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0187-0192</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Genomic prediction is meant for estimating the breeding value using molecular marker data which has turned out to be a powerful tool for efficient utilization of germplasm resources and rapid improvement of cultivars. Model-based techniques have been widely used for prediction of breeding values of genotypes from genomewide association studies. However, application of the random forest (RF), a model-free ensemble learning method, is not widely used for prediction. In this study, the optimum values of tuning parameters of RF have been identified and applied to predict the breeding value of genotypes based on genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where the number of SNPs ($P$ variables) is much higher than the number of genotypes ($n$ observations) ($P >> n$). Further, a comparison was made with the model-based genomic prediction methods, namely, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), ridge regression (RR) and elastic net (EN) under $P >> n$. It was found that the correlations between the predicted and observed trait response were 0.591, 0.539, 0.431 and 0.587 for RF, LASSO, RR and EN, respectively, which implies superiority of the RF over the model-based techniques in genomic prediction. Hence, we suggest that the RF methodology can be used as an alternative to the model-based techniques for the prediction of breeding value at genome level with higher accuracy.</p>

				<title>Molecular cloning and expression profiling of a chalcone synthase gene from <i>Lamiophlomis rotata</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0193-0205</page>
				<abstract>
					<p><i>Lamiophlomis rotata</i> is a renowned Chinese medicinal plant. Chalcone synthase (CHS) is important in flavonoid and isoflavonoid biosynthesis, catalysing the formation of naringenin chalcone in plants. A full-length cDNA encoding the <i>CHS</i> gene was cloned from <i>L. rotata</i> based on the highly conserved <i>CHS</i> gene sequences of <i>Labiatae</i> plants. A blast search showed its homology (named <i>LrCHS</i>) with other <i>CHS</i> genes of Labiate plants. The full-length genomic DNA of <i>LrCHS</i> was 2026 bp with one intron of 651 bp, two exons of 178 bp and 998 bp, flanked by a 73 bp $5'$-UTR and a 126 bp $3'$-UTR. The cDNA sequence of the <i>LrCHS</i> gene had an 1176 bp open reading frame encoding a 391 amino acid protein of 42,798 Da. The CHS protein predicted from <i>L. rotata</i> showed 79‚Äì86% identity with CHS of other plant species. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of nine families containing 48 plants and <i>L. rotata</i> based on the full amino acid sequences of CHS proteins. Consequently, <i>LrCHS</i> was located in the <i>Labiatae</i> branch. Additionally, we examined <i>LrCHS</i> gene expression patterns in different tissues by quantitative real-time PCR with specific primers. The expression analysis showed preferential expression of <i>LrCHS</i> in flowers and leaves during the flowering stage. Total flavonoid content and <i>CHS</i> gene expression exhibited similar patterns during <i>L. rotata</i> organ development. In agreement with its function as an elicitor-responsive gene, <i>LrCHS</i> expression was coordinated by methyl jasmonate and UV light, and induced between 6 and 18 h. These results provide a molecular basis for additional functional studies of <i>LrCHS</i> in <i>L. rotata</i>.</p>

				<title><i>Intersex</i> (<i>ix</i>) mutations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> cause nonrandom cell death in genital disc and can induce tumours in genitals in response to <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i><sup><i>disk</i></sup>) mutations</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0207-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the <i>intersex</i> (<i>ix</i>) is a terminally positioned gene in somatic sex determination hierarchy and function with the female specific product of <i>double sex</i> (DSX<sup>F</sup>) to implement female sexual differentiation. The null phenotype of <i>ix</i> is to transform diplo-X individuals into intersexes while leaving haplo-X animals unaffected. This study on the effect of different <i>intersex</i> mutations on genital disc development provides the following major results: (i) similar range of a characteristic array of morphological structures (from almost double sex terminalia to extreme reduction of terminal appendages) was displayed by the terminalia of XX <i>ix</i><sup>1</sup>/<i>ix</i><sup>1</sup>, XX <i>ix</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>ix</i><sup>2</sup> and XX <i>ix</i><sup>5</sup>/<i>ix</i><sup>5</sup> individuals; (ii) an increased number of apoptotic cells were found to occur in a localized manner in mature third instar larval genital discs of <i>ix</i> individuals; (iii) <i>ix</i> mutations can induce high frequency of neoplastic tumours in genitals in the presence of <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i><sup><i>disk</i></sup>) mutations; and (iv) heteroallelic combinations of <i>dpp</i><sup><i>disk</i></sup> mutations can also induce tumours in intersex genitals with variable expressivity. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that: (i) loss of function of <i>ix</i> causes massive cell death in both male and female genital primordia of genital discs, resulting phenotype mimicking in male and female characteristics in genitals; and (ii) at the discs, the apoptotic cells persist as ‚Äòundead‚Äô cells that can induce oncogenic transformation in the neighbouring disc cells when <i>dpp</i> signalling is blocked or reduced by <i>dpp</i><sup><i>disk</i></sup> mutations.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0221-0229</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This study was designed to detect the expression, detergent resistance, subcellular localization, and channel and hemichannel functions of mutant <i>Cx50</i> to understand the forming mechanism for inducing congenital cataract by a novel mutation p.S276F in <i>connexin 50 (Cx50)</i> reported previously by us. HeLa and human lens epithelial (HLE) cells were transfected with wild-type <i>Cx50</i> and mutant <i>Cx50</i> (S276F). We examined the functional characteristics of mutant <i>Cx50</i> (S276F) in comparison with those of wild-type <i>Cx50</i> using immunoblot, confocal fluorescence microscopy, dye transfer analysis and dye uptake assay. The mutant and wild-type <i>Cx50</i> were expressed in equal levels and could efficiently localize to the plasma membrane without transportation and assembly problems. Scrape loading dye transfer was significantly evident in cells transfected with wild-type <i>Cx50</i> compared to those in cells transfected with mutant <i>Cx50</i> and cotransfected with wild-type and mutant <i>Cx50</i>. The dye uptake was found to be significantly lower in cells transfected with mutant <i>Cx50</i> than in cells transfected with wild-type <i>Cx50</i> and cells cotransfected with wild-type and mutant <i>Cx50</i>. The transfected HeLa and HLE cell lines showed similar performance in all the experiments. These results indicated that the mutant <i>Cx50</i> (S276F) might inhibit the function of gap junction channel in a dominant negative manner, but inhibit the hemichannel function in a recessive negative manner.</p>

				<title>Allele mining across DREB1A and DREB1B in diverse rice genotypes suggest a highly conserved pathway inducible by low temperature</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0231-0238</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Low temperature stress is one of the major limiting factors affecting rice productivity in higher altitudes. <i>DREB1A</i> and <i>DREB1B</i>, are two transcription factors that have been reported to play key regulatory role in low temperature tolerance. In order to understand whether natural genetic variation in these two loci leads to cold tolerance or susceptibility, <i>OsDREB1A</i> and <i>OsDREB1B</i> were targeted across several rice genotypes showing differential response to low temperature. Expression data suggests induction of gene expression in shoots in response to low temperature in both tolerant and susceptible genotypes. Upon sequence analysis of 20 rice genotypes, eight nucleotide changes were identified including two in the coding region and six in the $5'$UTR. None of the discovered novel variations lie in the conserved region of the genes under study, thereby causing little or no changes in putative function of the corresponding proteins. <i>In silico</i> analysis using a diverse set of 400 <i>O. sativa</i> revealed much lower nucleotide diversity estimates across two <i>DREB</i> loci and one other gene (<i>MYB2</i>) involved in DREB pathway than those observed for other rice genes. None of the changes showed association with seedling stage cold tolerance, suggesting that nucleotide changes in <i>DREB</i> loci are unlikely to contribute to low temperature tolerance. So far, data concerning the physiological role and regulation of DREB1 in different genetic background are very limited; it is to be expected that they will be studied extensively in the near future.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The major constituents of agarwood oils are sesquiterpenes that are obtained from isoprenoid precursors through the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and the cytosolic mevalonate pathway. In this study, a novel full-length cDNA of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), which was the second key enzyme in the plastid MEP pathway of sesquiterpenes biosynthesis was isolated from the stem of <i>Aquilaria sinensis</i> (Lour.) Gilg by the methods of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique for the first time, and named as <i>AsDXR</i>. The full-length cDNA of <i>AsDXR</i> was 1768 bp, containing a 1437 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 478 amino acids with a molecular weight of 51.859 kD and the theoretical isoelectric point of 6.29. Comparative and bioinformatic analysis of the deduced AsDXR protein showed extensive homology with DXRs from other plant species, especially <i>Theobroma cacao</i> and <i>Gossypium barbadense</i>, and contained a conserved transit peptide for plastids, and extended pro-rich region and a highly conserved NADPH-binding motif owned by all plant DXRs. Southern blot analysis indicated that <i>AsDXR</i> belonged to a small gene family. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that <i>AsDXR</i> expressed strongly in root and stem, but weakly in leaf. Additionally, <i>AsDXR</i> expression was found to be activated by exogenous elicitor of MeJA (methyl jasmonate). The contents of three sesquiterpenes ($\alpha$-guaiene, $\alpha$-humulene and $\delta$-guaiene) were significantly induced by MeJA. This study enables us to further elucidate the role of <i>AsDXR</i> in the biosynthesis of agarwood sesquiterpenes in <i>A. sinensis</i> at the molecular level.</p>

				<title>Nucleotide composition bias and codon usage trends of gene populations in <i>Mycoplasma capricolum</i> subsp. <i>capricolum</i> and <i>M. agalactiae</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0251-0260</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Because of the low GC content of the gene population, amino acids of the two mycoplasmas tend to be encoded by synonymous codons with an A or T end. Compared with the codon usage of ovine, <i>Mycoplasma capricolum</i> and <i>M. agalactiae</i> tend to select optimal codons, which are rare codons in ovine. Due to codon usage pattern caused by genes with key biological functions, the overall codon usage trends represent a certain evolutionary direction in the life cycle of the two mycoplasmas. The overall codon usage trends of a gene population of <i>M. capricolum</i> subsp. <i>capricolum</i> can be obviously separated from other mycoplasmas, and the overall codon usage trends of <i>M. agalactiae</i> are highly similar to those of <i>M. bovis</i>. These results partly indicate the independent evolution of the two mycoplasmas without the limits of the host cell‚Äôs environment. The GC and AT skews estimate nucleotide composition bias at different positions of nucleotide triplets and the protein consideration caused by the nucleotide composition bias at codon positions 1 and 2 largely take part in synonymous codon usage patterns of the two mycoplasmas. The correlation between the codon adaptation index and codon usage variation indicates that the effect of codon usage on gene expression in <i>M. capricolum</i> subsp. <i>capricolum</i> is opposite to that of <i>M. agalactiae</i>, further suggesting independence of the evolutionary process influencing the overall codon usage trends of gene populations of mycoplasmas.</p>

				<title>Genomewide mapping reveals a combination of different genetic effects causing the genetic basis of heterosis in two elite rice hybrids</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0261-0270</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>North Carolina design III (NCIII) is one of the most powerful and widely used mating designs for understanding the genetic basis of heterosis. However, the quantitative trait mapping (QTL) conducted in previous studies with this design was mainly based on analysis of variance (ANOVA), composite interval or multiple interval mapping methods. These methodologies could not investigate all kinds of genetic effects, especially epistatic effects, simultaneously on the whole genome. In this study, with a statistical method for mapping epistatic QTL associated with heterosis using the recombinant inbred line (RIL)-based NCIII design, we conducted QTL mapping for nine agronomic traits of two elite hybrids to characterize the mode of gene action contributing to heterosis on a whole genomewide scale. In total, 23 main-effect QTL (M-QTL) and 23 digenic interactions in <i>IJ</i> (<i>indica</i> &#215; <i>japonica</i>) hybrids, 11 M-QTL and 82 digenic interactions in <i>II</i> (<i>indica</i> &#215; <i>indica</i>) hybrid QTLs were identified in the present study. The variation explained by individual M-QTL or interactions ranged from 2.3 to 11.0%. The number of digenic interactions and the total variation explained by interactions of each trait were larger than those of M-QTL. The augmented genetic effect ratio of most M-QTL and digenic interactions in (L<sub>1</sub>‚ÄìL<sub>2</sub>) data of two backcross populations (L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>) showed complete dominance or overdominance, and in (L<sub>1</sub> + L<sub>2</sub>) data showed an additive effect. Our results indicated that the dominance, overdominance and epistatic effect were important in conditioning the genetic basis of heterosis of the two elite hybrids. The relative contributions of the genetic components varied with traits and the genetic basis of the two hybrids was different.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Linkage map with wide marker coverage is an essential resource for genetic improvement study for any species. Sex-averaged genetic linkage map of <i>Labeo rohita</i>, popularly known as ‚Äòrohu‚Äô, widely cultured in the Indian subcontinent, was developed by placing 68 microsatellite markers generated by a simplified method. The parents and their F<sub>1</sub> progeny (92 individuals) were used as segregating populations. The genetic linkage map spans a sex-averaged total length of 1462.2 cM, in 25 linkage groups. The genome length of rohu was estimated to be 3087.9 cM. This genetic linkage map may facilitate systematic searches of the genome to identify genes associated with commercially important characters and marker-assisted selection programmes of this species.</p>

				<title>Marker-trait association study for protein content in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0279-0286</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i> L.) is the second most important cool season food legume cultivated in arid and semiarid regions of the world. The objective of the present study was to study variation for protein content in chickpea germplasm, and to find markers associated with it. A set of 187 genotypes comprising both international and exotic collections, and representing both desi and kabuli types with protein content ranging from 13.25% to 26.77% was used. Twenty-three SSR markers representing all eight linkage groups (LG) amplifying 153 loci were used for the analysis. Population structure analysis identified three subpopulations, and corresponding $Q$ values of principal components were used to take care of population structure in the analysis which was performed using general linear and mixed linear models. Marker-trait association (MTA) analysis identified nine significant associations representing four QTLs in the entire population. Subpopulation analyses identified ten significant MTAs representing five QTLs, four of which were common with that of the entire population. Two most significant QTLs linked with markers TR26.205 and CaM1068.195 were present on LG3 and LG5. Gene ontology search identified 29 candidate genes in the region of significant MTAs on LG3. The present study will be helpful in concentrating on LG3 and LG5 for identification of closely linked markers for protein content in chickpea and for their use in molecular breeding programme for nutritional quality improvement.</p>

				<title>Species and genetic diversity in the genus <i>Drosophila</i> inhabiting the Indian subcontinent</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0351-0361</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Biodiversity is the sum total of all living things on the earth with particular reference to the profound variety in structure, function and genetic constitution. It includes both number and frequency of species or genes in a given assemblage and the variety of resulting ecosystems in a region. It is usually considered at three different levels: genetic, species and ecological diversities. Genus <i>Drosophila</i> belongs to the family Drosophilidae (class Insecta, order Diptera), characterized by rich species diversity at global level and also in India, which is a megadiverse country. At global level, more than 1500 species have been described and several thousands estimated. Hawaiian Islands are particularly rich in species diversity with more than 500 species which provides a unique opportunity to study evolution in genus <i>Drosophila</i>. About 150 species of <i>Drosophila</i> have been reported from India. Certain species of <i>Drosophila</i> found in India have been investigated for genetic diversity within the species. In this regard, <i>Drosophila ananassae</i> is noteworthy. It is a cosmopolitan and domestic species with common occurrence in India and is endowed with many genetic peculiarities. Population genetics and evolutionary studies in this species have revealed as to how genetic diversity within a species play an important role in adaptation of populations to varying environments. In addition, the work carried on <i>D. melanogaster, D. nasuta, D. bipectinata</i> and certain other species in India has shown that these species vary in degree and pattern of genetic diversity, and have evolved different mechanisms for adjusting to their environments. The ecological adaptations to various kinds of stress studied in certain species of <i>Drosophila</i> inhabiting the Indian subcontinent are also discussed.</p>

				<title>Aldosterone synthase C-344T, angiotensin II type 1 receptor A1166C and 11-ùõΩ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase G534A gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension in the population of Odisha, India</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Essential hypertension which accounts 90‚Äì95% of the total hypertension cases is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. This study was undertaken to investigate the association of aldosterone synthase C-344T, angiotensin II type I receptor A1166C and 11-ùõΩ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 G534A polymorphisms with essential hypertension in the population of Odisha, India. A total of 246 hypertensive subjects (males, 159; females, 87) and 274 normal healthy individuals (males, 158; females, 116) were enrolled in this study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Analysis of genetic and biochemical data revealed that in this population the CT and TT genotypes of aldosterone synthase C-344T polymorphism, frequency of alcohol consumption and aldosterone levels were significantly high among the total as well as male hypertensives, while the AC and CC genotypes of angiotensin II type I receptor A1166C polymorphism were significantly high among the total as well as female hypertensives. High density lipoprotein levels were higher in male hypertensives.</p>

				<title>Genomewide identification, classification and analysis of NAC type gene family in maize</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0377-0390</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>NAC transcription factors comprise a large plant-specific gene family. Increasing evidence suggests that members of this family have diverse functions in plant growth and development. In this study, we performed a genomewide survey of NAC type genes in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.). A complete set of 148 nonredundant NAC genes (<i>ZmNAC1‚ÄìZmNAC148</i>) were identified in the maize genome using Blast search tools, and divided into 12 groups (a‚Äìl) based on phylogeny. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are distributed unevenly across all 10 chromosomes. Segmental and tandem duplication contributed largely to the expansion of the maize NAC gene family. The ùêæ<sub>a</sub>/ùêæ<sub>s</sub> ratio suggested that the duplicated genes of maize NAC family mainly experienced purifying selection, with limited functional divergence after duplication events. Microarray analysis indicated most of the maize NAC genes were expressed across different developmental stages. Moreover, 19 maize NAC genes grouped with published stress-responsive genes from other plants were found to contain putative stress-responsive <i>cis</i>-elements in their promoter regions. All these stress-responsive genes belonged to the group d (stress-related). Further, these genes showed differential expression patterns over time in response to drought treatments by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Our results reveal a comprehensive overview of the maize NAC, and form the foundation for future functional research to uncover their roles in maize growth and development.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Genomic imprinting of the <i>Cdkn1c</i>/<i>Kcnq1ot1</i> region shows lack of conservation between human and mouse. This region has been reported to be associated with Beckwith‚ÄìWiedemann syndrome (BWS) and cancer. To increase our understanding of imprinted genes in bovine <i>Cdkn1c</i>/<i>Kcnq1ot1</i> imprinting cluster, we assessed the imprinting status of four cattle genes (<i>Tssc4</i>, <i>Nap1l4</i>, <i>Phlda2</i> and <i>Osbpl5</i>) in seven types of tissues: heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat using polymorphism-based sequencing approach. It was found that all the four genes showed biallelic expression in tissues in which transcripts were detected. <i>Nap1l4</i> and <i>Tssc4</i> were detected in all examined tissues, while the expression of <i>Phlda2</i> and <i>Osbpl5</i> was tissue-specific. <i>Phlda2</i> was not detected in heart and subcutaneous fat, and <i>Osbpl5</i> was not detected in spleen and skeletal muscle. In addition, identification of species-specific imprinted genes is necessary to understand the evolution of genomic imprinting and to elucidate mechanisms leading to allele-specific expression.</p>

				<title>Transcriptome analysis reveals dynamic changes in the gene expression of tobacco seedlings under low potassium stress</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0397-0406</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Potassium plays a key role in plant development and reproduction. In agricultural practice, potassium deficiency is common worldwide, and leads to crop growth inhibition and output reduction. In this study, we analysed the transcriptome of tobacco seedlings under low potassium stress. Tobacco seedlings with or without decreased potassium treatment were harvested after 0 (control), 6, 12, or 24 h and were submitted for microarray analysis. The results showed that up to 3790 genes were upregulated or downregulated more than 2-fold as a result of the decreased potassium treatment. Gene ontology analysis revealed significantly differentially expressed genes that were categorized as cation binding, transcription regulation, metabolic processes, transporter activity and enzyme regulation. Some potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus transporters; transcription factors; and plant signal molecules, such as CPKs were also significantly differentially expressed under potassium deficiency. Our results indicate that the expression profiles of a large number of genes involved in various plant physiological processes are significantly altered in response to potassium deficiency, which can result in physiological and morphological changes in tobacco plants.</p>

				<title>The commonly used eye-specific <i>sev-GAL4</i> and <i>GMR-GAL4</i> drivers in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> are expressed in tissues other than eyes also</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0407-0416</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The binary <i>GAL4-UAS</i> system of conditional gene expression is widely used by <i>Drosophila</i> geneticists to target expression of the desired transgene in tissue of interest. In many studies, a preferred target tissue is the <i>Drosophila</i> eye, for which the <i>sev-GAL4</i> and <i>GMR-GAL4</i> drivers are most widely used since they are believed to be expressed exclusively in the developing eye cells. However, several reports have noted lethality following expression of certain transgenes under these GAL4 drivers notwithstanding the fact that eye is not essential for survival of the fly. Therefore, to explore the possibility that these drivers may also be active in tissues other than eye, we examined the expression of <i>UAS-GFP</i> reporter driven by the <i>sev-GAL4</i> or <i>GMR-GAL4</i> drivers. We found that both these drivers are indeed expressed in additional tissues, including a common set of specific neuronal cells in larval and pupal ventral and cerebral ganglia. Neither <i>sev</i> nor <i>glass</i> gene has so far been reported to be expressed in these neuronal cells. Expression pattern of <i>sev-GAL4</i> driver parallels that of the endogenous Sevenless protein. In addition to cells in which <i>sev-GAL4</i> is expressed, the <i>GMR-GAL4</i> is expressed in several other larval cell types also. Further, two different <i>GMR-GAL4</i> lines also show some specific differences in their expression domains outside the eye discs. These findings emphasize the need for a careful confirmation of the expression domains of a GAL4 driver being used in a given study, rather than relying only on the empirically claimed expression domains.</p>

				<title>Molecular characterization of zeta class glutathione <i>S</i>-transferases from <i>Pinus brutia</i> Ten.</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0417-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glutathione transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) play important roles in stress tolerance and metabolic detoxification in plants. In higher plants, studies on GSTs have focussed largely on agricultural plants. There is restricted information about molecular characterization of GSTs in gymnosperms. To date, only tau class GST enzymes have been characterized from some pinus species. For the first time, the present study reports cloning and molecular characterization of two zeta class GST genes, namely <i>PbGSTZ1</i> and <i>PbGSTZ2</i> from Pinus brutia Ten., which is an economically important pine native to the eastern Mediterranean region and have to cope with several environmental stress conditions. The <i>PbGSTZ1</i> gene was isolated from cDNA, whereas <i>PbGSTZ2</i> was isolated from genomic DNA. Sequence analysis of <i>PbGSTZ1</i> and <i>PbGSTZ2</i> revealed the presence of an open reading frame of 226 amino acids with typical consensus sequences of the zeta class plant GSTs. Protein and secondary structure prediction analysis of two zeta class <i>PbGSTZ</i>s have shared common features of other plant zeta class GSTs. Genomic clone, <i>PbGSTZ2</i> gene, is unexpectedly intronless. Extensive sequence analysis of <i>PbGSTZ2</i>, with cDNA clone, <i>PbGSTZ1</i>, revealed 87% identity at nucleotide and 81% identity at amino acid levels with 41 amino acids differences suggesting that genomic <i>PbGSTZ2</i> gene might be an allelic or a paralogue version of <i>PbGSTZ1</i>.</p>

				<page>0425-0434</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An <i>in planta</i> transformation protocol for sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench) using shoot apical meristem of germinating seedlings is reported in this study. <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain, LBA4404 with pCAMBIA1303 vector and construct pCAMBIA1303<i>TPS1</i> were individually used for transformation. Since, the transgene is integrated into the cells of already differentiated tissues, the T<sub>0</sub> plants were chimeric and stable integration was observed in T<sub>1</sub> generation. ùõΩ-Glucuronidase (GUS) expression in the seedlings and spikelets of emerging cob was the first indication of transformability in T<sub>0</sub> generation which was further confirmed by PCR analysis using <i>hpt</i> and <i>TPS1</i> gene-specific primers. Screening on 25 mg/L hygromycin combined with PCR analysis was used for selection of transformants in the T<sub>1</sub> generation. Transformation efficiencies ranged between 34‚Äì38% and 26‚Äì34% using pCAMBIA1303 vector and construct pCAMBIA1303<i>TPS1</i>, respectively. Molecular characterization of the T<sub>2</sub> transgenics using PCR, RT-PCR and Southern blot analyses further revealed the integration, expression and inheritance of the transgene. These results indicate the feasibility of the method to generate transgenics with pCAM-BIA1303 vector and construct pCAMBIA1303<i>TPS1</i>. The abiotic stress tolerance of <i>TPS1</i> transgenics developed in the present study was evident by the ability of the transformants to tolerate 200 mM NaCl as well as higher root growth and biomass.</p>

				<title>Map-based cloning and expression analysis of <i>BMR-6</i> in sorghum</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0445-0452</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Brown midrib mutants in sorghum are associated with reduced lignin content and increased cell wall digestibility. In this study, we characterized a <i>bmr-6</i> sorghum mutant, which shows reddish pigment in the midrib and stem after the fifth-leaf stage. Compared to wild type, Kalson lignin content of <i>bmr-6</i> is decreased significantly. We used histological analysis to determine that the mutant exhibited a modified pattern of lignin staining and found an increased polysaccharide content. We cloned <i>BMR-6</i> gene, a gene encoded a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), using a map-based cloning approach. Genetic complementation confirmed that CAD is responsible for the <i>BMR-6</i> phenotype. <i>BMR-6</i> gene was expressed in all tested sorghum tissues, with the highest being in midrib and stem. Transient expression assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves demonstrated cytomplasmic localization of BMR-6. We found that the expression level of <i>bmr-6</i> was significantly decreased in the mutant but expression of <i>SbCAD3</i> and <i>SbCAD5</i> were significantly increased. Our results indicate that <i>BMR-6</i> not only affects the distribution of lignin but also the biosynthesis of lignin in sorghum.</p>

				<title>Molecular survey of <i>Tamyb10-1</i> genes and their association with grain colour and germinability in Chinese wheat and <i>Aegilops tauschii</i></title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0453-0459</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To investigate allelic variation of <i>Myb10-1</i> genes in Chinese wheat and to examine its association with germination level in wheat, a total of 582 Chinese bread wheat cultivars and 110 <i>Aegilops tauschii</i> accessions were used to identify allelic variations of three <i>Myb10-1</i> genes. Identification results indicated that there is a novel <i>Tamyb10-B1</i> allele, designated <i>Tamyb10-B1c</i>, in the five Chinese landraces. The <i>Tamyb10-B1c</i> possibly has a large deletion including <i>Tamyb10-B1</i> gene. There are three novel <i>Tamyb10-D1</i> alleles (<i>Aetmyb10-D1c</i>, <i>Aetmyb10-D1d</i> and <i>Aetmyb10-D1e</i>) that were discovered in <i>Aegilops tauschii</i>. Of them, <i>Aetmyb10-D1c</i> allele possessed a 104-bp deletion and this resulted in a frame shift in the open reading frame of the <i>Aetmyb10-D1</i> gene. AETMYB10-D1d and AETMYB10-D1e proteins possessed three and two different amino acids when compared with TAMYB10-D1b protein, respectively. Association of <i>Tamyb10-1</i> allelic variation with grain germination level indicated that all five allelic combinations with red grains showed a significantly higher GP (germination percentage) and GI (germination index) values than those of white-grained <i>Tamyb10-A1a/Tamyb10-B1a/Tamyb10-D1a</i> genotype after storing it for one year. Moreover, the <i>Tamyb10-A1b/Tamyb10-B1c/Tamyb10-D1b</i> genotype possesses the significantly highest GP and GI among the six different <i>Tamyb10-1</i> combinations. This study could provide useful information for wheat breeding programme in terms of grain colour and germination level.</p>

				<title>Gene structure, phylogeny and expression profile of the sucrose synthase gene family in cacao (<i>Theobroma cacao</i> L.)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0461-0472</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In higher plants, sucrose synthase (Sus, EC 2.4.1.13) is widely considered as a key enzyme involved in sucrose metabolism. Although, several paralogous genes encoding different isozymes of Sus have been identified and characterized in multiple plant genomes, to date detailed information about the <i>Sus</i> genes is lacking for cacao. This study reports the identification of six novel <i>Sus</i> genes from economically important cacao tree. Analyses of the gene structure and phylogeny of the <i>Sus</i> genes demonstrated evolutionary conservation in the <i>Sus</i> family across cacao and other plant species. The expression of cacao <i>Sus</i> genes was investigated via real-time PCR in various tissues, different developmental phases of leaf, flower bud and pod. The <i>Sus</i> genes exhibited distinct but partially redundant expression profiles in cacao, with <i>TcSus1</i>, <i>TcSus5</i> and <i>TcSus6</i>, being the predominant genes in the bark with phloem, <i>TcSus2</i> predominantly expressing in the seed during the stereotype stage. <i>TcSus3</i> and <i>TcSus4</i> were significantly detected more in the pod husk and seed coat along the pod development, and showed development dependent expression profiles in the cacao pod. These results provide new insights into the evolution, and basic information that will assist in elucidating the functions of cacao <i>Sus</i> gene family.</p>

				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0525-0537</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Different stresses include nutrient deficiency, pathogen attack, exposure to toxic chemicals etc. Transcriptomic studies have been mainly applied to only a few plant species including the model plant, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. These studies have provided valuable insights into the genetic networks of plant stress responses. Transcriptomics applied to cash crops including barley, rice, sugarcane, wheat and maize have further helped in understanding physiological and molecular responses in terms of genome sequence, gene regulation, gene differentiation, posttranscriptional modifications and gene splicing. On the other hand, comparative transcriptomics has provided more information about plant‚Äôs response to diverse stresses. Thus, transcriptomics, together with other biotechnological approaches helps in development of stress tolerance in crops against the climate change.</p>

				<title>Genetic epidemiology of coronary artery disease: an Asian Indian perspective</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0539-0549</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent findings on the role of genetic factors in the aetiopathology of CAD have implicated novel genes and variants in addition to those involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. However, our present knowledge is limited due to lack of clarity on their exact identity and the quantum of impact on disease susceptibility, and incident risk. It is a matter of great interest to understand the role of genetic factors in ethnic populations that have a strong underlying predisposition to CAD such as the South Asian populations, particularly among Asian Indians living in India and abroad. Although, a number of isolated studies do implicate certain gene polymorphisms towards enhanced disease susceptibility, the available data remains scanty and inconclusive as they have not been validated in large, prospective cohorts. The present review aims to consolidate the available literature on the genetics of CAD in Asian Indians and seeks to provide insights on the concerns that need to be addressed in future studies to generate information having clinical value.</p>

				<title>Weird mammals provide insights into the evolution of mammalian sex chromosomes and dosage compensation</title>
				<feature>Review Article, Special section in honour of Mary F. Lyon</feature>
				<page>0567-0574</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The deep divergence of mammalian groups 166 and 190 million years ago (MYA) provide genetic variation to explore the evolution of DNA sequence, gene arrangement and regulation of gene expression in mammals. With encouragement from the founder of the field, Mary Lyon, techniques in cytogenetics and molecular biology were progressively adapted to characterize the sex chromosomes of kangaroos and other marsupials, platypus and echidna‚Äîand weird rodent species. Comparative gene mapping reveals the process of sex chromosome evolution from their inception 190 MYA (they are autosomal in platypus) to their inevitable end (the Y has disappeared in two rodent lineages). Our X and Y are relatively young, getting their start with the evolution of the sex-determining ùëÜùëÖùëå gene, which triggered progressive degradation of the Y chromosome. Even more recently, sex chromosomes of placental mammals fused with an autosomal region which now makes up most of the Y. Exploration of gene activity patterns over four decades showed that dosage compensation via X-chromosome inactivation is unique to therian mammals, and that this whole chromosome control process is different in marsupials and absent in monotremes and reptiles, and birds. These differences can be exploited to deduce how mammalian sex chromosomes and epigenetic silencing evolved.</p>

				<title>Divergent actions of long noncoding RNAs on X-chromosome remodelling in mammals and <i>Drosophila</i> achieve the same end result: dosage compensation</title>
				<feature>Review Article, Special section in honour of Mary F. Lyon</feature>
				<page>0575-0584</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Organisms with heterochromatic sex chromosomes need to compensate for differences in dosages of the sex chromosome-linked genes that have somatic functions. In-depth cytological and subsequent biochemical and molecular studies on dosage compensation started with Mary F. Lyon‚Äôs proposal in early 1960s that the Barr body in female mammalian somatic cells represented one of the randomly inactivated and heterochromatinized X chromosomes. In contrast, <i>Drosophila</i> was soon shown to achieve dosage compensation through hypertranscription of single X in male whose chromatin remains more open. Identification of proteins that remodel chromatin either to cause one of the two X chromosomes in somatic cells of very early female mammalian embryos to become condensed and inactive or to remodel the single X in male <i>Drosophila</i> embryos to a more open state for hypertranscription provided important insights into the underlying cellular epigenetic processes. However, the most striking and unexpected discoveries were the identification of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), X- inactive specific transcript (Xist) in mammals and roX1/2 in <i>Drosophila</i>, which were essential for achieving the contrasting chromatin organizations but leading to similar end result in terms of dosage compensation of X-linked genes in females and males. An overview of the processes of X inactivation or hyperactivation in mammals and <i>Drosophila</i>, respectively, and the roles played by Xist, roX1/2 and other lncRNAs in these events is presented.</p>

				<title>Understanding sex determination in the mouse: genetics, epigenetics and the story of mutual antagonisms</title>
				<feature>Review Article, Special section in honour of Mary F. Lyon</feature>
				<page>0585-0590</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent years have seen a rapid growth in mouse genetics resources that support research into fundamental mechanisms in organogenesis, including those controlling mammalian sex determinations. Numerous mouse mutants have shed light on molecular pathways of cell fate specification during gonadogenesis and the `decision' as to whether testis or ovary development is achieved. These studies indicate substantial genetic complexity, characterized by redundancy, feedback loops, mutual antagonism between testis-determining and ovary-determining gene regulatory networks and a degree of plasticity in the fully differentiated state of the adult gonad that was not appreciated until conditional loss-of-function studies were performed. One challenge now is to understand how controlled epigenomic changes effect the now familiar sexually dimorphic transcriptomic profiles of the male and female gonads, firstly during primary sex determination, but also in the adult gonad, thereby regulating cellular behaviour during morphogenesis and maintaining the differentiated state.</p>

				<title>X-chromosome inactivation and escape</title>
				<feature>Review Article, Special section in honour of Mary F. Lyon</feature>
				<page>0591-0599</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>X-chromosome inactivation, which was discovered by Mary Lyon in 1961 results in random silencing of one X chromosome in female mammals. This review is dedicated to Mary Lyon, who passed away last year. She predicted many of the features of X inactivation, for e.g., the existence of an X inactivation center, the role of L1 elements in spreading of silencing and the existence of genes that escape X inactivation. Starting from her published work here we summarize advances in the field.</p>

				<title>Understanding gene expression in coronary artery disease through global profiling, network analysis and independent validation of key candidate genes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0601-0610</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Molecular mechanism underlying the patho-physiology of coronary artery disease (CAD) is complex. We used global expression profiling combined with analysis of biological network to dissect out potential genes and pathways associated with CAD in a representative case‚Äìcontrol Asian Indian cohort. We initially performed blood transcriptomics profiling in 20 subjects, including 10 CAD patients and 10 healthy controls on the Agilent microarray platform. Data was analysed with Gene Spring Gx12.5, followed by network analysis using David v 6.7 and Reactome databases. The most significant differentially expressed genes from microarray were independently validated by real time PCR in 97 cases and 97 controls. A total of 190 gene transcripts showed significant differential expression (fold change &#62; 2, P &#60; 0.05) between the cases and the controls of which 142 genes were upregulated and 48 genes were downregulated. Genes associated with inflammation, immune response, cell regula- tion, proliferation and apoptotic pathways were enriched, while inflammatory and immune response genes were displayed as hubs in the network, having greater number of interactions with the neighbouring genes. Expression of ùê∏ùê∫ùëÖ1/2/3, ùêºùêø8, ùê∂ùëãùê∂ùêø1, ùëÉùëáùê∫ùëÜ2, ùê∂ùê∑69, ùêºùêπùëÅùê∫, ùêπùê¥ùëÜùêøùê∫, ùê∂ùê∂ùêø4, ùê∂ùê∑ùê∂42, ùê∑ùê∑ùëã58, ùëÅùêπùêæùêµùêºùê∑ and ùëÅùëÖ4ùê¥2 genes were independently validated; ùê∏ùê∫ùëÖ1/2/3 and ùêºùêø8 showed &#62;8-fold higher expression in cases relative to the controls implying their important role in CAD. In conclusion, global gene expression profiling combined with network analysis can help in identifying key genes and pathways for CAD.</p>

				<title>Chalcone synthase genes from milk thistle (<i>Silybum marianum</i>): isolation and expression analysis</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0611-0617</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Silymarin is a flavonoid compound derived from milk thistle (<i>Silybum marianum</i>) seeds which has several pharmacological applications. Chalcone synthase (CHS) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids; thereby, the identification of ùê∂ùêªùëÜ encoding genes in milk thistle plant can be of great importance. In the current research, fragments of ùê∂ùêªùëÜ genes were amplified using degenerate primers based on the conserved parts of Asteraceae ùê∂ùêªùëÜ genes, and then cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the resultant nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences led to the identification of two different members of ùê∂ùêªùëÜ gene family, ùëÜùëöùê∂ùêªùëÜ1 and ùëÜùëöùê∂ùêªùëÜ2. Third member, full-length cDNA (ùëÜùëöùê∂ùêªùëÜ3) was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), whose open reading frame contained 1239 bp including exon 1 (190 bp) and exon 2 (1049 bp), encoding 63 and 349 amino acids, respectively. <i>In silico</i> analysis of SmCHS3 sequence contains all the conserved CHS sites and shares high homology with CHS proteins from other plants. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that ùëÜùëöùê∂ùêªùëÜ1 and ùëÜùëöùê∂ùêªùëÜ3 had the highest transcript level in petals in the early flowering stage and in the stem of five upper leaves, followed by five upper leaves in the mid-flowering stage which are most probably involved in anthocyanin and silymarin biosynthesis.</p>

				<title>Statistical equivalent of the classical TDT for quantitative traits and multivariate phenotypes</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0619-0628</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Clinical end-point traits are usually governed by quantitative precursors. Hence, there is active research interest in developing statistical methods for association mapping of quantitative traits. Unlike population-based tests for association, family-based tests for transmission disequilibrium are protected against population stratification. In this study, we propose a logistic regression model to test the association for quantitative traits based on a trio design. We show that the method can be viewed as a direct extension of the classical transmission diequilibrium test for binary traits to quantitative traits. We evaluate the performance of our method using extensive simulations and compare it with an existing method, family-based association test. We found that the two methods yield comparable powers if all families are considered. However, unlike FBAT, which yields an inflated rate of false positives when noninformative trios with all three individuals‚Äô heterozygous are removed, our method maintains the correct size without compromising too much on power. We show that our method can be easily modified to incorporate multivariate phenotypes. Here, we applied this method to analyse a quantitative endophenotype associated with alcoholism.</p>

				<title>Frequency of mutations in Mediterranean fever gene, with gender and genotype‚Äìphenotype correlations in a Turkish population</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0629-0635</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary inflammatory periodic disease, characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, abdominal pain, synovitis and pleurisy. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and distribution of Mediterranean fever (ùëÄùê∏ùêπùëâ) gene mutations and to investigate the clinical characteristics and genotype‚Äìphenotype correlation in patients with FMF in Aydƒ±n, a province in western Anatolia, Turkey. Therefore, we retrospectively analysed ùëÄùê∏ùêπùëâ gene mutations in 383 patients with suspected FMF and the clinical features of 327 among them. The ùëÄùê∏ùêπùëâ gene mutations were investigated using the reverse dot-blot hybridization technique. We detected 26 different genotypes and 11 different mutations. The most common mutations in our cohort were p.M694V (41.15%), p.E148Q (20.35%), p.M680I(G/C) (12.39%) and p.R761H (9.73%). Abdominal pain (86.2%), fever (80.7%), arthralgia (57.2%), vomiting (36.1%), arthritis (34.6%), fatigue (31.5%), anorexia (22.9%) and chest pain (19.0%) were the most prevalent clinical features in our patients. This is the first study from Aydƒ±n in which the distribution of ùëÄùê∏ùêπùëâ gene mutations and clinical features were evaluated in patients with FMF. We found that the most common mutation was p.M694V in our region, while the frequency of the p.R761H mutation was higher compared to other regions of Turkey with respect to extracted data from previous similar studies. Presented results supported the clinical findings in the literature that the homozygous p.M694V and compound heterozygous genotype were associated with more severe courses in FMF patients.</p>

				<title>Combined effect between two functional polymorphisms of <i>SLC6A12</i> gene is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0637-0642</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common epilepsy subtype with complex genetic structure. A recent study in four populations (Ireland, UK, Australia and Finland) reported an allelic association between betaine/GABA transporter-1 (ùêµùê∫ùëá-1 or ùëÜùêøùê∂6ùê¥12) and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. To demonstrate the association between ùëÜùêøùê∂6ùê¥12 gene polymorphisms and TLE, TaqMan method was used to genotype five single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ùëÜùêøùê∂6ùê¥12 gene in 358 TLE patients and 596 nonepileptic control subjects of Chinese Han origin. Real-time PCR was used to detect the effects of variations on gene expression associated with TLE. Though, the single-marker analysis did not demonstrate allelic association with TLE, rs542736‚Äìrs557881 interaction showed significant association. The ùëÜùêøùê∂6ùê¥12 expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were significantly higher in TLE patients than in control subjects and were correlated to rs542736 G‚Äìrs557881 A haplotypes. Our preliminary results suggested combined effect of two common polymorphisms on SLC6A12 gene may be associated with TLE, but the precise mechanism needs further investigation.</p>

				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0643-0649</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lead is one of the most present contaminants in the environment, and different species respond differently to this type of pollution. If combined with genomic stress, lead may act synergistically, causing significant decrease of fitness components. We used two genetically diverse <i>Drosophila subobscura</i> populations (regarding both putatively adaptive inversion and microsatellite loci polymorphisms) originating from two ecologically distinct habitats. To establish different levels of genome heterozygosity, series of intraline, intrapopulation and interpopulation crosses were made. The progeny were reared on a standard medium and a medium with 200 ùúág/mL of lead acetate. Development time was significantly extended to all groups reared on lead. The progeny of intraline crosses showed significantly extended development time compared to all other groups. The obtained results suggest that genome heterozygosity reduces the effect of lead pollution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Elevated levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been shown to amplify the inflammatory response against periodontopathogenic bacteria. In humans, polymorphisms in the ùêºùêø1ùê¥ and ùêºùêø1ùêµ genes are the most well-studied genetic polymorphisms associated with periodontal disease (PD). In contrast to human, there is a lack of knowledge on the genetic basis of canine PD. A case‚Äìcontrol study was conducted in which a molecular analysis of dog ùêºùêø1ùê¥ and ùêºùêø1ùêµ genes was performed. Of the eight genetic variants identified, seven in ùêºùêø1ùê¥ gene and one in ùêºùêø1ùêµ gene, ùêºùêø1ùê¥/1_g.388A&#62;C and ùêºùêø1ùê¥/1_g.521T&#62;A showed statistically significant differences between groups (adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.15 (0.03‚Äì0.76), ùëÉ = 0.022; 5.76 (1.03‚Äì32.1), P = 0.046, respectively). It suggests that in the studied population the ùêºùêø1ùê¥/1_g.388C allele is associated with a decreased PD risk, whereas the ùêºùêø1ùê¥/1_g.521A allele can confer an increased risk. Additionally, the ùêºùêø1ùê¥/2_g.515G>T variation resulted in a change of amino acid, i.e. glycine to valine. <i>In silico</i> analysis suggests that this change can alter protein structure and function, predicting it to be deleterious or damaging. This work suggests that ùêºùêø1 genetic variants may be important in PD susceptibility in canines.</p>

				<title>Frequency of congenital malformations and chromosomal disorders in Bacau and Vaslui counties (Romania)</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0661-0668</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents the state of genetic health of the human populations in two Romanian counties, Bacau and Vaslui, as they are different in area, number of inhabitants, level of economic and social development, etc. The data presented in this paper is from the Public Health Directions of the two counties, reflecting the situation recorded during 2006‚Äì2013. In the 8 years study, 1894 cases of congenital and chromosomal disorders were recorded in the newborns from the populations in the two counties. The identified cases were distributed based on years, categories of disorders and sexes. The  average frequency of congenital disorders in the two populations over the investigated period was about 1.65 in Bacau county and 1.83% in Vaslui counties. In the population of Bacau county, these disorders affect in the same number in both the sexes (49.62% female cases and 50.38% male cases), while in Vaslui, the male cases are more than the females (53.92 and 46.08%, respectively). The main congenital disorders observed were: cardiovascular system anomalies, musculoskeletal system, urogenital system, etc. During the investigation period, in the human population of Bacau county, 97 cases of newborns with chromosomal disorders were diagnosed (0.16% of the living newborns), while in Vaslui county there were 106 cases (0.26% of the living newborns). Among these disorders, the Down‚Äôs syndrome was the most frequent one, representing 83.5 and 85.8% of cases in the population of Bacau county, and Vaslui counties.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Microarrays offer an opportunity to explore the functional sequence polymorphism among different cultivars of many crop plants. The Affymetrix microarray expression data of five genotypes of <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L. at six different fibre developmental stages was used to identify single feature polymorphisms (SFPs). The background corrected and quantile-normalized log<sub>2</sub> intensity values of all probes of triplicate data of each cotton variety were subjected to SFPs call by using SAM procedure in R language software. We detected a total of 37,473 SFPs among six pair genotype combinations of two superior (JKC777 and JKC725) and three inferior (JKC703, JKC737 and JKC783) using the expression data. The 224 SFPs covering 51 genes were randomly selected from the dataset of all six fibre developmental stages of JKC777 and JKC703 for validation by sequencing on a capillary sequencer. Of these 224 SFPs, 132 were found to be polymorphic and 92 monomorphic which indicate that the SFP prediction from the expression data in the present study confirmed a ‚àº 58.92% of true SFPs. We further identified that most of the SFPs are associated with genes involved in fatty acid, flavonoid, auxin biosynthesis etc. indicating that these pathways significantly involved in fibre development.</p>

				<title>Mutational landscape of the human Y chromosome-linked genes and loci in patients with hypogonadism</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0677-0687</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sex chromosome-related anomalies engender plethora of conditions leading to male infertility. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a rare but well-known cause of male infertility. Present study was conducted to ascertain possible consensus on the alterations of the Y-linked genes and loci in males representing hypogonadism (H), which in turn culminate in reproductive dysfunction. A total of nineteen 46, XY males, clinically diagnosed with H (11 representative HH adults and eight prepubertal boys suspected of having HH) were included in the study. Sequence-tagged site screening, ùëÜùëÖùëå gene sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping (FISH), copy number and relative expression studies by real-time PCR were conducted to uncover the altered status of the Y chromosome in the patients. The result showed random microdeletions within the ùê¥ùëçùêπùëé (73%)/ùëè (78%) and ùëê(26%) regions. Sequencing of the ùëÜùëÖùëå gene showed nucleotide variations within and outside of the HMG box in four males (21%). FISH uncovered mosaicism for ùëÜùëÖùëå, ùê¥ùëÄùê∏ùêøùëå, ùê∑ùê¥ùëç genes and DYZ1 arrays, structural rearrangement for ùê¥ùëÄùê∏ùêøùëå (31%) and duplication of ùê∑ùê¥ùëç (57%) genes. Copy number variation for seven Y-linked genes (2‚Äì8 rounds of duplication), DYZ1 arrays (495‚Äì6201copies) and differential expression of ùëÜùëÖùëå, ùëàùëáùëå and ùëâùê∂ùëå in the patients‚Äô blood were observed. Present work demonstrates the organizational vulnerability of several Y-linked genes in H males. These results are envisaged to be useful during routine diagnosis of H patients.</p>

				<title><i>CD133</i> and <i>BMI1</i> expressions and its prognostic role in primary glioblastoma</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0689-0696</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour, generated by bulk of malignant cancer stem cells, which express various stem cell factors like CD133, BMI1 and nestin. There are several studies which show the importance of CD133 in cancer, but the function and interaction with other major oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes is still not understood. This study aimed to analyse the expression of CD133 mRNA and its correlations with BMI1 protein expression and ùëáùëÉ53 mutations in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients and its role in prognosis. Overexpression of ùê∂ùê∑133 mRNA and BMI1 protein was found in 47.6 and 76.2% patients respectively and ùëáùëÉ53 mutations was seen in 57.1% of patients in our study. There was no correlation among ùëáùëÉ53 mutations and expressions of ùê∂ùê∑133 and BMI1. We found that high level of BMI1 expression was favourable for the patient survival (P = 0.0075) and high ùê∂ùê∑133 mRNA expression was unfavourable for the patient survival (ùëÉ = 0.0226). ùê∂ùê∑133 mRNA and BMI1 protein expression could independently predict the glioblastoma patient survival in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, the overexpression of these stem cell markers is a common event in glioblastoma progression and could be used as potential prognostic markers.</p>

				<title>Genetic diversity and population structure of endangered <i>Aquilaria malaccensis</i> revealed potential for future conservation</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0697-0704</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The endangered <i>Aquilaria malaccensis</i>, is an important plant with high economic values. Characterization of genetic diversity and population structure is receiving tremendous attention for effective conservation of genetic resources. Considering important repositories of biological diversity, the genetic relationships of 127 <i>A. malaccensis</i> accessions from 10 home gardens of three states of northeast India were assessed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Of the 1153 fragments amplified with four AFLP primer combinations, 916 (79.4%) were found to be polymorphic. Polymorphic information content (PIC) and marker index (MI) of each primer combination correlate significantly with the number of genotypes resolved. Overall, a high genetic diversity (avg. 71.85%) was recorded. Further, high gene flow (ùëÅ<sub>m</sub> : 3.37), low genetic differentiation (ùêπ<sub>ST</sub> : 0.069) and high within population genetic variation (93%) suggests that most of the genetic diversity is restricted within population. Neighbour joining (NJ), principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Bayesian-based STRUCTURE grouped all the accessions in two clusters with significant intermixing between populations, therefore, revealed that two genetically distinct gene pools are operating in the <i>A. malaccensis</i> populations cultivated in home gardens. Based on the various diversity inferences, five diverse populations (JOH, FN, HLF, DHM and ITN) were identified, which can be potentially exploited to develop conservation strategies for <i>A. malaccensis</i>.</p>

				<title>Rapid cloning and bioinformatic analysis of spinach Y chromosome-specific EST sequences</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0705-0713</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The genome of spinach single chromosome complement is about 1000 Mbp, which is the model material to study the molecular mechanisms of plant sex differentiation. The cytological study showed that the biggest spinach chromosome (chromosome 1) was taken as spinach sex chromosome. It had three alleles of sex-related ùëã, ùëã<sup>m</sup> and ùëå. Many researchers have been trying to clone the sex-determining genes and investigated the molecular mechanism of spinach sex differentiation. However, there are no successful cloned reports about these genes. A new technology combining chromosome microdissection with hybridization-specific amplification (HSA) was adopted. The spinach Y chromosome degenerate oligonucleotide primed-PCR (DOP-PCR) products were hybridized with cDNA of the male spinach flowers in florescence. The female spinach genome was taken as blocker and cDNA library specifically expressed in Y chromosome was constructed. Moreover, expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences in cDNA library were cloned, sequenced and bioinformatics was analysed. There were 63 valid EST sequences obtained in this study. The fragment size was between 53 and 486 bp. BLASTn homologous alignment indicated that 12 EST sequences had homologous sequences of nucleic acids, the rest were new sequences. BLASTx homologous alignment indicated that 16 EST sequences had homologous protein-encoding nucleic acid sequence. The spinach Y chromosome-specific EST sequences laid the foundation for cloning the functional genes, specifically expressed in spinach Y chromosome. Meanwhile, the establishment of the technology system in the research provided a reference for rapid cloning of other biological sex chromosome-specific EST sequences.</p>

					<p>Seasonality of animals is an important adaptive trait for successful survival and production during limited food availability and extreme environmental conditions. Photoperiodic changes in day length are utilized by these seasonal animals as an important environmental cue for regulating their annual rhythms of reproduction cycles. Melatonin is an important hormone which is secreted by the pineal gland in proportion to darkness and its effect is mediated by melatonin receptor subtypes, principally ùëÄùëáùëÅùëÖ1ùê¥. In the present study, polymorphism in the coding sequence at two important SNPs (C606T and G612A), known to be markers for out of season breeding in sheep were studied by PCR-RFLP in a panel of four breeds of sheep from subtemperate and subtropical arid conditions, respectively. The frequencies of `G' and `A' alleles with reference to G612A SNP did not differ considerably among all the breeds of sheep. Frequency of `T' allele of the C606T SNP was found to be dominantly higher in subtemperate sheep breeds in comparison to subtropical sheep breeds. Identified SNPs in the coding region were mostly synonymous and did not lead to any change in conformation of the MTNR1A receptor protein.</p>

				<title>Development of molecular map and identification of QTLs linked to <i>Fusarium wilt</i> resistance in chickpea</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0723-0729</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A number of genetic maps for <i>Fusarium</i> wilt resistance in chickpea have been reported in earlier studies, however QTLs identified for <i>Fusarium</i> wilt resistance were unstable. Hence, the present study aims to map novel molecular markers and to identify QTLs for <i>Fusarium</i> wilt resistance in chickpea. An intraspecific linkage map of chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i> L.) was constructed using F<sub>10</sub>‚ÄìF<sub>11</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between K850 and WR315 segregating for H<sub>2</sub> locus. A set of 31 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers obtained by screening 300 SSRs and were used for genotyping. The linkage map had four linkage groups and coverage of 690 cM with a marker density of 5.72 cM. The RILs were screened for their wilt reaction across two seasons in wilt sick plot at International Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad, India. Five major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected in both seasons for late wilting (60 days after sowing). A stable QTL (GSSR 18-TC14801) for wilt resistance was identified in both the seasons, and the QTL explained a variance of 69.80 and 60.80% in 2007 and 2008 rabi respectively.</p>

				<title>Comparing genetic variants detected in the 1000 genomes project with SNPs determined by the International HapMap Consortium</title>

				<page>0731-0740</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) determined based on SNP arrays from the international HapMap consortium (HapMap) and the genetic variants detected in the 1000 genomes project (1KGP) can serve as two references for genomewide association studies (GWAS). We conducted comparative analyses to provide a means for assessing concerns regarding SNP array-based GWAS findings as well as for realistically bounding expectations for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based GWAS. We calculated and compared base composition, transitions to transversions ratio, minor allele frequency and heterozygous rate for SNPs from HapMap and 1KGP for the 622 common individuals. We analysed the genotype discordance between HapMap and 1KGP to assess consistency in the SNPs from the two references. In 1KGP, 90.58% of 36,817,799 SNPs detected were not measured in HapMap. More SNPs with minor allele frequencies less than 0.01 were found in 1KGP than HapMap. The two references have low discordance (generally smaller than 0.02) in genotypes of common SNPs, with most discordance from heterozygous SNPs. Our study demonstrated that SNP array-based GWAS findings were reliable and useful, although only a small portion of genetic variances were explained. NGS can detect not only common but also rare variants, supporting the expectation that NGS-based GWAS will be able to incorporate a much larger portion of genetic variance than  SNP arrays-based GWAS.</p>

				<title>Identification and introgression of QTLs implicated in resistance to sorghum downy mildew (<i>Peronosclerospora sorghi</i> (Weston and Uppal) C. G. Shaw) in maize through marker-assisted selection</title>
				<feature>Research Article</feature>
				<page>0741-0748</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Sorghum downy mildew caused by <i>Peronosclerospora sorghi</i> is a major disease of maize and resistance is under the control of polygenes which necessitated identification of quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) for initiating marker-assisted introgression of resistant QTLs in elite susceptible inbred lines. In the present study, QTLs for sorghum downy mildew (SDM) resistance in maize were identified based on cosegregation with linked simple sequence repeats in 185 F<sub>2</sub> progeny from a cross between susceptible (CM500-19) and resistant (MAI105) parents. F<sub>3</sub> families were screened in the National Sorghum Downy Mildew Screening Nursery during 2010 and 2011. High heritability was observed for the disease reaction. The final map generated using 87 SSR markers had 10 linkage groups, spanning a length of 1210.3 cM. Although, we used only 87 SSR markers for mapping, the per cent of genome within 20 cM to the nearest marker was 88.5. Three putative QTLs for SDM resistance were located on chromosomes 3 (bin 3.01), 6 (bin 6.01) and 2 (bin 2.02) using composite interval mapping. The locus on chromosome 3 had a major effect and explained up to 12.6% of the phenotypic variation. The other two QTLs on chromosomes 6 and 2 had minor effects with phenotypic variation of 7.1 and 2%. The three QTLs appeared to have additive effects on resistance. The QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 6 were successfully used in the marker-assisted selection programme for introgression of resistance to SDM in eight susceptible maize lines.</p>

				<title>LncRNAs: emerging players in gene regulation and disease pathogenesis</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0771-0784</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The advent of next-generation sequencing has demonstrated that eukaryotic genomes are extremely complex than what were previously thought. Recent studies revealed that in addition to protein-coding genes, nonprotein-coding genes have allocated a large fraction of the genome. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes are classified as nonprotein-coding genes, serving as a molecular signal, decoy, guide and scaffold. They were suggested to play important roles in chromatin states, epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation of genes. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs and changes in their structure are associated with a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from different types of cancer and neurodegeneration to ùõº-thalassaemia. The purpose of this study was to summarize the current progress in understanding the genomic bases and origin of lncRNAs. Moreover, this study focusses on the diverse functions of lncRNAs in normal cells as well as various types of disease to illustrate the potential impacts of lncRNAs on diverse biological processes and their therapeutic significance.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p><i>Drosophila</i>, a dipteran insect, has been found to be the best biological model for different kinds of studies. <i>D. melanogaster</i> was first described by Meigen in 1830, is most extensively studied species of the genus <i>Drosophila</i> and a number of investigations employing this species have been documented in areas such as genetics, behaviour, evolution, development, molecular biology, ecology, population biology, etc. Besides <i>D. melanogaster</i>, a number of other species of the genus <i>Drosophila</i> have also been used for different kinds of investigations. Among these, <i>D. ananassae</i>, a cosmopolitan and domestic species endowed with several unusual genetic features, is noteworthy. Described for the first time from Indonesia (Doleschall 1858), this species is commonly distributed in India. Extensive research work on <i>D. ananassae</i> has been done by numerous researchers pertaining to cytology, genetics, mutagenesis, gene mapping, crossing-over in both sexes, population and evolutionary genetics, behaviour genetics, ecological genetics, sexual isolation, fluctuating asymmetry, trade-offs etc. Genome of <i>D. ananassae</i> has also been sequenced. The status of research on <i>D. ananassae</i> at global level is briefly described in this review. Bibliography on this species from different countries worldwide reveals that maximum contribution is from India.</p>

				<title>Dynamics of sex expression and chromosome diversity in Cucurbitaceae: a story in the making</title>
				<feature>Review Article</feature>
				<page>0793-0808</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The family Cucurbitaceae showcases a wide range of sexual phenotypes being variedly regulated by biological and environmental factors. In the present context, we have tried to assemble reports of cytogenetic investigations carried out in cucurbits accompanied by information on sex expression diversities and chromosomal or molecular basis of sex determination in dioecious (or other sexual types, if reported) taxa known so far. Most of the Cucurbitaceae tribes have mixed sexual phenotypes with varying range of chromosome numbers and hence, ancestral conditions become difficult to probe. Occurrence of polyploidy is rare in the family and has no influence on sexual traits. The sex determination mechanisms have been elucidated in some well-studied taxa like <i>Bryonia</i>, <i>Coccinia</i> and <i>Cucumis</i> showing interplay of genic, biochemical, developmental and sometimes chromosomal determinants. Substantial knowledge about genic and molecular sex differentiation has been obtained for genera like <i>Momordica</i>, <i>Cucurbita</i> and <i>Trichosanthes</i>. The detailed information on sex determination schemes, genomic sequences and molecular phylogenetic relationships facilitate further comprehensive investigations in the tribe Bryonieae. The discovery of organ identity genes and sex-specific sequences regulating sexual behaviour in <i>Coccinia</i>, <i>Cucumis</i> and <i>Cucurbita</i> opens up opportunities of relevant investigations to answer yet unaddressed questions pertaining to floral unisexuality, dioecy and chromosome evolution in the family. The present discussion brings the genera in light, previously recognized under subfamily Nhandiroboideae, where the study of chromosome cytology and sex determination mechanisms can simplify our understanding of sex expression pathways and its phylogenetic impacts.</p>
